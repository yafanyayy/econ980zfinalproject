Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal '16 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on the financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
Please note that during Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from both the Q2 fiscal '16 and historical results. We have provided Q2 fiscal '16 and historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. 
With that, I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to Chuck."

Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending impacting our business, especially during the last few weeks of January, as we closed our quarter. Despite this slowdown, we executed very well, with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we've created in our business over the last several years. 
Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected, creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role, enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers from the sensor to the data center with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom. 
When I took this role 2 quarters ago, I discussed my focused on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform, providing the automation and programmability for our customers' most critical business applications with the scale, speed and security they require. In just 2 years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig transition and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center.
Second, security remains the most [indiscernible], and as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business while, at the same time, migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our security business grow 11%, but our security deferred revenue grew 26%. 
Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki Cloud Networking security. You're seeing as move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition. 
And fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talents in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT and analytics. Our recently announced acquisition of Jasper, combined with our other capabilities, is a strong example of how we will pay a unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections with the security, speed and reliability they've come to expect from Cisco. 
Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total reven",1056,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2%, with product revenue growth of 2% led by growth in security, routing and collaboration. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms, with particular strength in mobility and web scale service provider. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our Unified Communications business. Deferred revenues show continued strength, growing 15%.
Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have tough comparison from Q2 '15 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.
Wireless was flat as a result of declines in our access point controller business, offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP Video grew 37%, largely driven by strength in China. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 26%.
We had strong growth in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 180% and 40%, respectively.
We added over 2,000 customers on our advanced malware solution, bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. 
Services revenue grew 3%, and we continue to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had a solid growth of 8% in total, with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product deferred revenue, which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses, grew 34%.
In total, product orders grew 2%. Our book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run our business, Americas was flat, EMEA declined 1% and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7%, with the BRICS plus Mexico showing strength at up 70%, with China up 64% and India up 23%.
Total emerging, minus the BRIC countries, was down 3%. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2% and Commercial grew 4%, both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public Sector was flat, and Service Provider grew 5%.
We drove strong profitability with disappointing rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%.
We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8%, with a $0.015 attributable to lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62.
In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were 3 material items to call out, which we excluded from our non-GAAP results: the gain on the sale of the SP Video CPE business, the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit and prior year fiscal year impact of the restatement of the federal R&D tax credit.
The total impact of these and immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion. 
So moving on to shareholder value. In Q2, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available in the U.S.
In the first half of fiscal year '16, we have returned $4.6 billion or 75% [ph] of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends.
Today, we announced that 24% or $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. 
We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program, raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion.
This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and are confident in the strength and stability on our ongoing cash flow. 
Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability and operating leverage.
We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue. 
Let me to reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every 5 to 6 years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. 
Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses.
The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q3 fiscal year '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rates to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. We -- the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56.
We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slide and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed, coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships and our M&A capabilities, will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future.
On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed everyday by CEOs, boards and country leaders, as we preview our strategy and roadmaps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive security portfolio that protects them before, during and after an attack. They see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas.
They trust us, they value our innovation and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision. 
Our customers in countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it's happening now. As we help them through this transition, you'll see us operate on 2 fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run company that executes even in challenging markets. 
Longer  term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology.
Marilyn, I'll turn back over to you for questions."

Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So on the macro fund, I think the thing that I can tell you is as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations in the month as we run our business for a long time and really know what to expect. And our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had all of the at the end of the first quarter. And I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would expect the quarter to go. And our weekend, suggesting of the data point, the end of the calendar year. So while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January. So we ended at the end of the third week of January, which we all know, this first 3 weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. And so what I will tell you that after week 10, through those 3 weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to just digest what was going on, they just paused bit. And you see customers say, ""I want to just wait, see what's going on. Let me take a look at this. We want to understand this a little better."" And I think to Kelly's point, when she talked about the switching business. The camp when the opportunities that have been pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say, ""Hey, our infrastructure is working, so we're going to just told on that for some period of time, and let's see where things go."" so that's probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing everyday. What I would tell you, and I'll ask Kelly to comment on the -- on our guidance is I would say that we took that sort of feeling of those first 3 weeks into consideration as we built our guidance. And that's what we based it on. It's what the last 3 weeks of last quarter sort of led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments?"

I would say the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the Enterprise and the Service Provider space, I think that what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there's uncertainty. So you see them continuing to spend in security. You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data Center evolution, which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio. And I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait. They chose to wait a bit. So I don't view it as any -- I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the Enterprise portfolio or things like that. I think that it was largely just a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the Enterprise side. The Service Provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams have been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures, how they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think that we did that. And then I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. And so we're pleased with where we are. I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over 2 or 3 quarters, that you're going to see -- you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on, with the exception of the Enterprise customers just prioritizing where they spent their money. As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I'll ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question. But I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they've been doing for the last 3, 4, 5, 6 quarters. So it's something that we deal with as it relates to, as an example, our collaboration portfolio. We made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available -- or we announced it'll be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective, and in many cases, it'll be a hybrid model. So to the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we'll make that available to them. Kelly?"

On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress, whether it's in turn -- we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within collaboration and Security. But also in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers. There are ways to monetize our Services and software along that way. So we'll continue to disclose more, especially as we look at our business and becomes a bigger part of that. So I'd say it's progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper, which are both SaaS models. We'll continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. On the IT to OpEx, just add to what Chuck said. I'd say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is. So whether it's our Cisco Capital offer or the ability of us to build managed services as-a-service, those kind of offers, we're very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption.

What I baked into the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that the we will get from things like our service and subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses as well as some product flow-through on the distribution we're seeing.

And as you know, on the Apple front, we are actually doing the development. I think Tim alluded to it in his conference call that both companies are doing the development that we need to do much to actually deliver that joint innovation to our customers. But the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we're literally in sort of a handful stage right now. But we do see that accelerating. We have a lot of focus on it with our teams. Hans, their CEO, and I are going to be together quite a bit Mobile World Congress in a couple of weeks. And we're also but have a lot of the next generation joint solutions that we are putting together for our customers that will be on display in both of our booths there.

And then the other thing that we haven't really talked about is obviously, outside United States. We saw currency. Talked about on the last call in Europe and Asia that clearly continue to maybe get a little worse in some places. On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we've seen happening in India. We've seen tremendous success there. We have -- that's one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John has been leading for us. And our business there continues to grow very well. In China, which is the crux of your question, I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last 3 years, and I think I talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window, the team did a great job. And what they really did was they diversified our business strategy across customer segments, so not only being aligned ask state of enterprises, but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy, moving out into second-, third-tier cities, so geographic diversification. And they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio. So the good news is what I'll tell you is, I think, the growth that we saw in China was very well-balanced across our portfolio. We saw routing up, Kelly, keep me on this, writing switching double digits, wireless double digits and as well as SP Video double digits. So it was very balanced performance for the second quarter in a row. So there's clearly a lot of uncertainty out there, so we're going to take things a quarter at a time, but we're pleased with where they are."

We have built a strategic framework that is guiding us for what we believe we need to have in our portfolio and the architectures that we need to be able to build relative to cloud, security, analytics, SaaS, IoT. We have built that framework with our teams in the first 2 or 3 months that I was in the role. We didn't step back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to fill some of those opportunities and where are the opportunities like, what we saw with Jasper, where we can move and actually fill a portion of our portfolio. And so that's what's driving us. It's very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to, what I believe, our customers care about in the future.

On the Security front, I would say that it is primarily, and Kelly can just again keep me on this, on the deferred piece of this, if it's flowing through, but what we talked about was the integration of the Sourcefire assets as well as the Cisco assets as well as other acquisitions we made along the way, plus the other innovation that our teams in Tripoli have done.

And we look at that advanced malware portfolio and a vignette it yet another 2,000 customers this quarter, so we're up to 10,000, which is -- they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy. And then during the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons. And so what we're hoping for similar success.

We had a tough comp a year ago, 40%. But I'll tell you, the other thing that we looked at is even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter than it was last quarter that it was a year quarter ago, which says that it just -- in my mind, excessive kind of suffering at the same rate that the rest of the busted for the macro.

We also increased our authorization just as we would normally would increase our authorization, the $15 billion. In terms of flexibility, yes, we will be accessing debt in the near future. Again, that's one of the benefits of our balance sheet and our access to capital is very, very good, so we will continue to do that until, I think, changes in our overseas cash.

So I appreciate the questions. 
That was apparently the last question we have. Some that are close with just some short. I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter, as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment. Our team did a great job. And as we look forward, I think about how we're operating the company on these 2 fronts. The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this company in a

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal '16 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue; and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Form 10-Q, which identify the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
Please note that during Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from both the Q2 fiscal '16 and historical results. We have provided Q2 fiscal '16 and historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.

Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending, impacting our business, especially during the last few weeks of January, as we closed our quarter. Despite the slowdown, we executed very well, with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow, up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we've created in our business over the last several years. 
Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected, creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role, enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers, from the sensor to the data center, with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom. 
When I took this role 2 quarters ago, I discussed my focused on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform, providing the automation and programmability for our customers' most critical business applications, with the scale, speed and security they require. In just 2 years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig transition and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center.
Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers and as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business, while, at the same time, migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our Security business grow 11%, but our Security deferred revenue grew 26%. 
Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki cloud networking and Security. You're seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition. 
And fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT and analytics. Our recently announced acquisition of Jasper, combined with our other capabilities, is a strong example of how we will play a unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections, with the security, speed and reliability they've come to expect from Cisco. 
Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility, while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

Total reven",1059,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2%, with product revenue growth of 2% led by growth in Security, Routing and Collaboration. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms, with particular strength in mobility and web scale service providers. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by a 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our Unified communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength, growing 15%.
Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have a tough comparison from Q2 '15 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.
Wireless was flat as a result of declines in our access plane controller business, offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP Video grew 37%, largely driven by strength in China. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 26%.
We had strong growth in our advanced threat, security and web security solutions, which grew over 180% and 40% respectively.
We added over 2,000 customers on our AMP, Advanced Malware solution, bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. 
Services revenue grew 3%, and we continue to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had a solid growth of 8% in total, with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product-deferred revenue, which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses, grew 34%.
In total, product orders grew 2%. Our book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat, EMEA declined 1% and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength at up 70%, with China up 64% and India up 23%.
Total emerging, minus the BRICM countries, was down 3%. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2% and Commercial grew 4%, both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public Sector was flat, and Service Provider grew 5%.
We drove strong profitability with disappointing rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%.
We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8%, with a $0.015 attributable to lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62.
In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were 3 material items to call out which we excluded from our non-GAAP results: the gain on the sale of the SP Video CPE business; the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit; and prior year fiscal year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit.
The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion. 
So moving on to shareholder value. In Q2, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available in the U.S.
In the first half of fiscal year '16, we have returned $4.6 billion or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends.
Today, we announced a 24% or a $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. 
We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program, raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion.
This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and are confident in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flow. 
Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability and operating leverage.
We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every 5 to 6 years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. 
Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses.
The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q3 fiscal year '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rates to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. We -- the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56.
We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed, coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships and our M&A capabilities, will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future.
On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed everyday by CEOs, boards and country leaders as we preview our strategy and road maps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive Security portfolio that protects them before, during and after an attack. They see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas.
They trust us, they value our innovation and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision. 
Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it's happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on 2 fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer-term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology.
Marilyn, I'll turn it back to you for questions."

Hey, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So on the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect. And our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter. And I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. And our week 10, just so you have the data point, was the end of the calendar year. So while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January. So we ended at the end of the third week of January, which, we all know, those first 3 weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. And so what I will tell you is that after week 10, through those 3 weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to just digest what was going on, they just paused a bit. And you see customers say, ""I want to just wait to see what's going on. Let me take a look at this. We want to understand this a little better."" And I think to Kelly's point, when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say, ""Hey, our infrastructure is working, so we're going to just hold on that for some period of time, and let's see where things go."" So that's probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing everyday. What I would tell you, and I'll ask Kelly to comment on the -- on our guidance, is I would say that we took that sort of feeling of those first 3 weeks into consideration as we built our guidance. And that's what we based it on, is what the last 3 weeks of last quarter sort of led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments?"

And then you have a bigger picture strategy around software and your cutting services fully believe in that strategy and model.

Thanks, Vijay. I would say if you -- the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the Enterprise and the Service Provider space, I think that what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there's uncertainty. So you see them continuing to spend in security. You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution, which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio. And I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit. So I don't view it as any -- I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the Enterprise portfolio or things like that. I think that it was largely just a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the Enterprise side. The Service Provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams had been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures, how they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think that we did that. And then I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. And so we're pleased with where we are. I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over 2 or 3 quarters, that you're going to see -- you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on, with the exception of the Enterprise customers, just prioritizing where they spent their money. As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I'll ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question. But I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they've been doing for the last 3, 4, 5, 6 quarters. So it's something that we deal with as it relates to, as an example, our Collaboration portfolio. We made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available -- or we announced it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective, and in many cases, it will be a hybrid model. So to the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we'll make that available to them. Kelly?"

On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress, whether it's in turn -- we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within Collaboration and Security, but also in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers that there are ways to monetize our services and software along that way. So we'll continue to disclose more, especially as we look at our business and it becomes a bigger part of that. So I'd say it's progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper, which are both SaaS models. We'll continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said. I'd say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is. So whether it's our Cisco Capital offer or the ability of us to build managed service as a service, those kind of offers, we're very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption. And we have that flexibility because of our strong balance sheet. So I'd say we're making a lot of progress on both of those accounts."

So back -- the last time we had this was in Q3 of fiscal year '10, and it was about a 4% to 5% increase. I'd say what I baked in with my 2% -- so it's roughly about $250 million to $275 million. What I baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our Services and Subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses as well as some product flow-through on the distribution that we're seeing. So that's what I baked in the guidance. I am not assuming there's going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment. The sales guys are out there, the teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number. And given the spending constraint that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. So that's how I build that up. Just to remind you, back in Q3 of 2010, our growth that quarter was 27%. So it's a much different macro environment."

I think Tim alluded to it on his conference call that we're both -- both companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that joint innovation to our customers. But the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we're literally in sort of the handful stage right now. But we do see that accelerating. We have a lot of focus on it with our teams. Hans, their CEO, and I are going to be together quite a bit in Mobile World Congress in a couple of weeks.

And the -- your specific question. We saw it pretty holistically, I'd say, around the globe. And then the other thing that we haven't really talked about is, obviously, outside the United States, we saw currency. We talked about, on the last call, in Europe and Asia, that clearly continue to maybe even get a little worse in some places. On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we've seen happening in India. We've seen tremendous success there. We have -- that's one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John has been leading for us. And our business there continues to grow very well. In China, which is the crux of your question, I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last 3 years, and I think, Brent, you and I have talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window, the team did a great job. And what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments, so not only being aligned to stay on enterprises, but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy, moving out into second-, third-tier cities, so geographic diversification. And they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio. So the good news is, what I'll tell you is, that the growth that we saw in China was very well-balanced across our portfolio.

So let me comment on the M&A activity that you've seen. We have built a strategic framework that is guiding us for what we believe we need to have in our portfolio and the architectures that we need to be able to build relative to cloud, security, analytics, SaaS, IoT. We have built that framework with our team in the first 2 or 3 months that I was in the role. We then stepped back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to fill some of those opportunities, and where are there opportunities like what we saw with Jasper, where we can move and actually fill a substantive portion of our portfolio. And so that's what's driving us. It's very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to, what I believe, that our customers care about in the future. And I would say that you should expect us to continue the pace. And obviously, valuations in today's market, that's one piece of good news, is that they're more attractive. As it relates to -- all right. I'm blanking on the second part. I'm sorry. Security. Thank you. On the Security front, I would say that it is primarily, and Kelly can just again keep me honest on the deferred piece of this, if it's flowing through. But what we talked about was the integration of the Sourcefire assets as well as the Cisco assets as well as other acquisitions we made along the way, plus the other innovation that our teams internally have done. And that has -- we put all that together about 2 quarters ago when we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve, and our teams have driven that. And when you look at that Advanced Malware portfolio and we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter, so we're up to 10,000, which is -- they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy. And then during the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons. And so we're hoping for similar success. But I think, primarily, it's because of continued improvement in the portfolio and the work our team has done. I wouldn't suggest that there is a significant revenue impact coming back in from the deferred yet, although we are seeing..."

We had a tough comp from a year ago, 40%. But I'll tell you, the other thing that we looked at is that even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter than it was last quarter, than it was a quarter a year ago, which says that it just -- in my mind, it says it kind of suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro.

Again, that's one of the benefits of our balance sheet, and our access to capital, it's very, very good, so we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash.

So on the SP Video front, I think that the team has done a great job of evolving that portfolio and really building some great solutions there engaged with lots of customers. Our strategy when we divested of the Video CPE business was really focused on a cloud-based delivery model. And that is occurring, and we're having obviously good success with that platform in China. And that tends to be an ongoing kind of -- a longer-term solution that the customers deploy. So we'll see again. We're taking things kind of quarter-by-quarter, but we feel good about where they are there. On the second part of your question, relative to the web scale guys, we have -- we've talked in the last couple of quarters about how we had been having success with them. And I talked about us really changing our strategy about 18 months ago and moving more into a collaborative sort of co-development mode with them, thinking about what their very unique needs are. And I'll tell you that our business with them last quarter grew 17%. So we continue to see relatively good strength with those customers."

Kim, thanks. That was apparently the last question we have. So I'm going to close with just some short comments. I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter, and as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment, our teams did a great job. And as we look forward, I think about how we're operating the company on these 2 fronts. The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this company in a well-managed way even in challenging environments, but at the same time, we're going to move full speed ahead. And the second front is that we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need, and I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that's going to fundamentally change every company and every country around the world. Now I believe we can do both, and I think that will allow us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity ahead of us and I have a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute against that.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal '16 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue; and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Form 10-Q, which identify the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
Please note that during Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from both the Q2 fiscal '16 and historical results. We have provided Q2 fiscal '16 and historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.

Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending, impacting our business, especially during the last few weeks of January, as we closed our quarter. Despite the slowdown, we executed very well, with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow, up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we've created in our business over the last several years. 
Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected, creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role, enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers, from the sensor to the data center, with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom. 
When I took this role 2 quarters ago, I discussed my focus on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform, providing the automation and programmability for our customers' most critical business applications, with the scale, speed and security they require. In just 2 years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig transition and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center.
Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers and as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business, while, at the same time, migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our Security business grow 11%, but our Security deferred revenue grew 26%. 
Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki cloud networking and Security. You're seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition. 
And fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT and analytics. Our recently announced acquisition of Jasper, combined with our other capabilities, is a strong example of how we will play a unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections, with the security, speed and reliability they've come to expect from Cisco. 
Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility, while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

Total reven",1060,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2%, with product revenue growth of 2% led by growth in Security, Routing and Collaboration. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms, with particular strength in mobility and web scale service providers. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by a 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our Unified communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength, growing 15%.
Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have a tough comparison from Q2 '15 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.
Wireless was flat as a result of declines in our access plane controller business, offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP Video grew 37%, largely driven by strength in China. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 26%.
We had strong growth in our advanced threat, security and web security solutions, which grew over 180% and 40% respectively.
We added over 2,000 customers on our AMP, Advanced Malware solution, bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. 
Services revenue grew 3%, and we continue to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had a solid growth of 8% in total, with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product-deferred revenue, which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses, grew 34%.
In total, product orders grew 2%. Our book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat, EMEA declined 1% and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength at up 70%, with China up 64% and India up 23%.
Total emerging, minus the BRICM countries, was down 3%. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2% and Commercial grew 4%, both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public Sector was flat, and Service Provider grew 5%.
We drove strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%.
We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8%, with a $0.015 attributable to lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62.
In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were 3 material items to call out which we excluded from our non-GAAP results: the gain on the sale of the SP Video CPE business; the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit; and prior year fiscal year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit.
The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion. 
So moving on to shareholder value. In Q2, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available in the U.S.
In the first half of fiscal year '16, we have returned $4.6 billion or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends.
Today, we announced a 24% or a $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. 
We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program, raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion.
This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and are confident in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flow. 
Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability and operating leverage.
We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every 5 to 6 years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. 
Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses.
The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q3 fiscal year '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rates to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. We -- the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56.
We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed, coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships and our M&A capabilities, will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future.
On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed everyday by CEOs, boards and country leaders as we preview our strategy and road maps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive Security portfolio that protects them before, during and after an attack. They see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas.
They trust us, they value our innovation and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision. 
Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it's happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on 2 fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer-term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology.

Hey, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So on the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect. And our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter. And I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. And our week 10, just so you have the data point, was the end of the calendar year. So while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January. So we ended at the end of the third week of January, which, we all know, those first 3 weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. And so what I will tell you is that after week 10, through those 3 weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to just digest what was going on, they just paused a bit. And you see customers say, ""I want to just wait to see what's going on. Let me take a look at this. We want to understand this a little better."" And I think to Kelly's point, when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say, ""Hey, our infrastructure is working, so we're going to just hold on that for some period of time, and let's see where things go."" So that's probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing everyday. What I would tell you, and I'll ask Kelly to comment on the -- on our guidance, is I would say that we took that sort of feeling of those first 3 weeks into consideration as we built our guidance. And that's what we based it on, is what the last 3 weeks of last quarter sort of led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments?"

And I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit. So I don't view it as any -- I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the Enterprise portfolio or things like that. I think that it was largely just a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the Enterprise side. The Service Provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams had been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures, how they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think that we did that. And then I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. And so we're pleased with where we are. I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over 2 or 3 quarters, that you're going to see -- you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on, with the exception of the Enterprise customers, just prioritizing where they spent their money. As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I'll ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question. But I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they've been doing for the last 3, 4, 5, 6 quarters. So it's something that we deal with as it relates to, as an example, our Collaboration portfolio. We made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available -- or we announced it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective, and in many cases, it will be a hybrid model. So to the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we'll make that available to them. Kelly?"

On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress, whether it's in turn -- we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within Collaboration and Security, but also in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers that there are ways to monetize our services and software along that way. So we'll continue to disclose more, especially as we look at our business and it becomes a bigger part of that. So I'd say it's progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper, which are both SaaS models. We'll continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said. I'd say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is. So whether it's our Cisco Capital offer or the ability of us to build managed service as a service, those kind of offers, we're very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption. And we have that flexibility because of our strong balance sheet. So I'd say we're making a lot of progress on both of those accounts."

What I baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our Services and Subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses as well as some product flow-through on the distribution that we're seeing. So that's what I baked in the guidance. I am not assuming there's going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment. The sales guys are out there, the teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number. And given the spending constraint that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. So that's how I build that up.

I think Tim alluded to it on his conference call that we're both -- both companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that joint innovation to our customers. But the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we're literally in sort of the handful stage right now. But we do see that accelerating.

And then the other thing that we haven't really talked about is, obviously, outside the United States, we saw currency. We talked about, on the last call, in Europe and Asia, that clearly continue to maybe even get a little worse in some places. On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we've seen happening in India. We've seen tremendous success there. We have -- that's one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John has been leading for us. And our business there continues to grow very well. In China, which is the crux of your question, I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last 3 years, and I think, Brent, you and I have talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window, the team did a great job. And what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments, so not only being aligned to state owned enterprises, but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy, moving out into second-, third-tier cities, so geographic diversification. And they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio. So the good news is, what I'll tell you is, that the growth that we saw in China was very well-balanced across our portfolio.

We have built that framework with our team in the first 2 or 3 months that I was in the role. We then stepped back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to fill some of those opportunities, and where are there opportunities like what we saw with Jasper, where we can move and actually fill a substantive portion of our portfolio. And so that's what's driving us. It's very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to, what I believe, that our customers care about in the future.

On the Security front, I would say that it is primarily, and Kelly can just again keep me honest on the deferred piece of this, if it's flowing through.

And that has -- we put all that together about 2 quarters ago when we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve, and our teams have driven that. And when you look at that Advanced Malware portfolio and we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter, so we're up to 10,000, which is -- they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy. And then during the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons. And so we're hoping for similar success. But I think, primarily, it's because of continued improvement in the portfolio and the work our team has done.

We had a tough comp from a year ago, 40%. But I'll tell you, the other thing that we looked at is that even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter that it was last quarter, that it was a quarter a year ago, which says that it just -- in my mind, it says it kind of suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro.

Again, that's one of the benefits of our balance sheet, and our access to capital, it's very, very good, so we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash.

So as you know, we continually have some price erosion and we use price as a lever to drive selling. Our price erosion has remained very, very disciplined. You'll see that it's been in the normal ranges that we have been in the last quarter and actually slightly better than a year ago. So that continues. We're getting real traction, continued traction from our engineers and supply chain on the productivity side. So for the price erosion we have, we're more than offsetting it with productivity and we're continuing to drive those projects to continue to do that, so we can have that flexibility to make sure we're taking advantage of all opportunities for growth out there. So that's continuing. On the operating margin side, again, we're going to be smart about managing the overall equation. We want to make sure we're taking advantage and investing in the right areas to be able to take advantage of future growth and balancing that equation. There is a bit of goodness coming through at the OEM line because of FX favorability that you guys are aware of, that falls through the bottom line. But in general, I'd say that we're being very disciplined in terms of how we make these trade-offs and balance the bottom line with the investments we're trying to make to accelerate growth."

So literally, the $250 million or so, the $275 million that we're assuming, literally is just the businesses where it's just going to because we have weekly billings, it's going to amortize off our balance sheet. That is basically a guarantee. And just marginally, a little bit more for some of the distribution and flow business. So I would say, as you're modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges. Take that out, that $250 million to $275 million, and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4, okay? On the software and SaaS, I know you and others ask me this question a lot. And it's tough to quantify. Certainly, it's a point or 2, easy to say, off the top. Some of the businesses -- we're growing our businesses that we've had that are great, like Collab and Security. We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers, like these big Enterprise ELAs we have. It's just hard to quantify it for any 1 quarter, right of when it's going to fall in. But there's certainly something on the top line, but we'll see that come back through as we continue to build that out and amortize it."

I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter, and as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment, our teams did a great job.

The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this company in a well-managed way even in challenging environments, but at the same time, we're going to move full speed ahead. And the second front is that we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need, and I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that's going to fundamentally change every company and every country around the world. Now I believe we can do both, and I think that will allow us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity ahead of us and I have a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute against that.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal '16 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue; and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Form 10-Q, which identify the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
Please note that during Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from both the Q2 fiscal '16 and historical results. We have provided Q2 fiscal '16 and historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.

Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending, impacting our business, especially during the last few weeks of January, as we closed our quarter. Despite the slowdown, we executed very well, with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow, up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we've created in our business over the last several years. 
Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected, creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role, enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers, from the sensor to the data center, with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom. 
When I took this role 2 quarters ago, I discussed my focus on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform, providing the automation and programmability for our customers' most critical business applications, with the scale, speed and security they require. In just 2 years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig transition and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center.
Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers and as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business, while, at the same time, migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our Security business grow 11%, but our Security deferred revenue grew 26%. 
Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki cloud networking and Security. You're seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition. 
And fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT and analytics. Our recently announced acquisition of Jasper, combined with our other capabilities, is a strong example of how we will play a unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections, with the security, speed and reliability they've come to expect from Cisco. 
Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility, while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

Total reven",1060,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2%, with product revenue growth of 2% led by growth in Security, Routing and Collaboration. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms, with particular strength in mobility and web scale service providers. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by a 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our Unified communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength, growing 15%.
Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have a tough comparison from Q2 '15 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.
Wireless was flat as a result of declines in our access plane controller business, offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP Video grew 37%, largely driven by strength in China. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 26%.
We had strong growth in our advanced threat, security and web security solutions, which grew over 180% and 40% respectively.
We added over 2,000 customers on our AMP, Advanced Malware solution, bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. 
Services revenue grew 3%, and we continue to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had a solid growth of 8% in total, with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product-deferred revenue, which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses, grew 34%.
In total, product orders grew 2%. Our book-to-bill was approximately 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat, EMEA declined 1% and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength at up 70%, with China up 64% and India up 23%.
Total emerging, minus the BRICM countries, was down 3%. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2% and Commercial grew 4%, both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public Sector was flat, and Service Provider grew 5%.
We drove strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%.
We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8%, with a $0.015 attributable to lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62.
In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were 3 material items to call out which we excluded from our non-GAAP results: the gain on the sale of the SP Video CPE business; the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit; and prior year fiscal year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit.
The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion. 
So moving on to shareholder value. In Q2, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available in the U.S.
In the first half of fiscal year '16, we have returned $4.6 billion or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends.
Today, we announced a 24% or a $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. 
We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program, raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion.
This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and are confident in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flow. 
Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability and operating leverage.
We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every 5 to 6 years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. 
Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses.
The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q3 fiscal year '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rates to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. We -- the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56.
We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed, coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships and our M&A capabilities, will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future.
On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed everyday by CEOs, boards and country leaders as we preview our strategy and road maps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive Security portfolio that protects them before, during and after an attack. They see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas.
They trust us, they value our innovation and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision. 
Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it's happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on 2 fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer-term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology.

Hey, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So on the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect. And our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter. And I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. And our week 10, just so you have the data point, was the end of the calendar year. So while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January. So we ended at the end of the third week of January, which, we all know, those first 3 weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. And so what I will tell you is that after week 10, through those 3 weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to just digest what was going on, they just paused a bit. And you see customers say, ""I want to just wait to see what's going on. Let me take a look at this. We want to understand this a little better."" And I think to Kelly's point, when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say, ""Hey, our infrastructure is working, so we're going to just hold on that for some period of time, and let's see where things go."" So that's probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing everyday. What I would tell you, and I'll ask Kelly to comment on the -- on our guidance, is I would say that we took that sort of feeling of those first 3 weeks into consideration as we built our guidance. And that's what we based it on, is what the last 3 weeks of last quarter sort of led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments?"

I'd like to get your view on this Enterprise versus Service Provider dichotomy, if any? And then you have a bigger picture strategy around software and your cutting services fully believe in that strategy and model. So my question is really around do you see IT spending queuing quickly towards OpEx versus the traditional CapEx model of spending? And how would Cisco delever to this higher-than-usual OpEx IT spending moving forward?"

I would say if you -- the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the Enterprise and the Service Provider space, I think that what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-",441,"Okay. Thanks, Vijay. I would say if you -- the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the Enterprise and the Service Provider space, I think that what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there's uncertainty. So you see them continuing to spend in security. You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution, which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio. And I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit. So I don't view it as any -- I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the Enterprise portfolio or things like that. I think that it was largely just a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the Enterprise side. The Service Provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams had been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures, how they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think that we did that. And then I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. And so we're pleased with where we are. I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over 2 or 3 quarters, that you're going to see -- you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on, with the exception of the Enterprise customers, just prioritizing where they spent their money. As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I'll ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question. But I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they've been doing for the last 3, 4, 5, 6 quarters. So it's something that we deal with as it relates to, as an example, our Collaboration portfolio. We made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available -- or we announced it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective, and in many cases, it will be a hybrid model. So to the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we'll make that available to them. Kelly?"

On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress, whether it's in turn -- we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within Collaboration and Security, but also in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers that there are ways to monetize our services and software along that way. So we'll continue to disclose more, especially as we look at our business and it becomes a bigger part of that. So I'd say it's progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper, which are both SaaS models. We'll continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said. I'd say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is. So whether it's our Cisco Capital offer or the ability of us to build managed service as a service, those kind of offers, we're very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption.

What I baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our Services and Subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses as well as some product flow-through on the distribution that we're seeing. So that's what I baked in the guidance. I am not assuming there's going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment. The sales guys are out there, the teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number. And given the spending constraint that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. So that's how I build that up.

I think Tim alluded to it on his conference call that we're both -- both companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that joint innovation to our customers. But the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we're literally in sort of the handful stage right now. But we do see that accelerating.

And what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments, so not only being aligned to state owned enterprises, but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy, moving out into second-, third-tier cities, so geographic diversification. And they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio.

And that has -- we put all that together about 2 quarters ago when we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve, and our teams have driven that. And when you look at that Advanced Malware portfolio and we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter, so we're up to 10,000, which is -- they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy. And then during the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons. And so we're hoping for similar success.

I was hoping you could provide some additional details regarding the weakness in the data center business, what changed there, how do you expect that to progress moving forward. And then for Kelly, with respect to capital allocation. It seems like you have a little bit less than $4 billion in U.S. cash, yet you materially raised the dividend and the buyback. So I was hoping to understand if we should be expecting a debt raise, and to what degree this means any acquisitions we may see are likely to be on the smaller side?"

So I'm surprised we got this far in the questions before someone asked about data centers. So I was beginning to worry. We've tracked that business very closely, obviously, and largely, what we believe is that it is connected to the broader macro issue. The -- that data center business has a strong buying season that actually runs into the end of December. And while it is a fantastic franchise for us that has contributed and will contribute to not only our success in the data center in the past but also with our success in the next-gen data center as we build next-generation data center stacks going forward, but it also -- we also believe that, in the December quarter, that we actually still gained share with that performance. We had a tough comp from a year ago, 40%. But I'll tell you, the other thing that we looked at is that even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter than it was last quarter, than it was a quarter a year ago, which says that it just -- in my mind, it says it kind of suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro. Kelly, second part of the question?"

We want to give a minimum of the 50% back to our shareholders. We've been listening to our shareholders. And the bottom line is we feel very, very good about our business model and our ongoing cash flows. You saw our operating cash up 36% this quarter, that we thought we'd increase the amount of our dividend sustainably going forward. So it's a blend. We also increased our authorization just as we would normally would increase our authorization, the $15 billion. In terms of flexibility, yes, we will be accessing debt in the near future. Again, that's one of the benefits of our balance sheet, and our access to capital, it's very, very good, so we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash. But it does not change our flexibility in any way in terms of acquisitions. When we think through these capital allocation decisions, we're playing out what we're thinking about acquisition-wise, how we're building that out as well as our future cash flows. So I think no change to our acquisition strategy. It does not hamper us in any way. We have easy access to capital. And again, I wanted to share some of that cash back with our shareholders."

So as you know, we continually have some price erosion and we use price as a lever to drive selling. Our price erosion has remained very, very disciplined. You'll see that it's been in the normal ranges that we have been in the last quarter and actually slightly better than a year ago. So that continues. We're getting real traction, continued traction from our engineers and supply chain on the productivity side. So for the price erosion we have, we're more than offsetting it with productivity and we're continuing to drive those projects to continue to do that, so we can have that flexibility to make sure we're taking advantage of all opportunities for growth out there. So that's continuing. On the operating margin side, again, we're going to be smart about managing the overall equation. We want to make sure we're taking advantage and investing in the right areas to be able to take advantage of future growth and balancing that equation. There is a bit of goodness coming through at the OEM line because of FX favorability that you guys are aware of, that falls through the bottom line. But in general, I'd say that we're being very disciplined in terms of how we make these trade-offs and balance the bottom line with the investments we're trying to make to accelerate growth."

So I would say, as you're modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges. Take that out, that $250 million to $275 million, and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4, okay? On the software and SaaS, I know you and others ask me this question a lot. And it's tough to quantify. Certainly, it's a point or 2, easy to say, off the top. Some of the businesses -- we're growing our businesses that we've had that are great, like Collab and Security. We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers, like these big Enterprise ELAs we have. It's just hard to quantify it for any 1 quarter, right, of when it's going to fall in.

And the second front is that we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need, and I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that's going to fundamentally change every company and every country around the world.

By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. 
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
Please note that during Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from both the Q2 fiscal '16 and historical results. We have provided Q2 fiscal '16 and historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts.

Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending, impacting our business, especially during the last few weeks of January, as we closed our quarter. Despite the slowdown, we executed very well, with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow, up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we've created in our business over the last several years. 
Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected, creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role, enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers, from the sensor to the data center, with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom. 
When I took this role 2 quarters ago, I discussed my focus on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform, providing the automation and programmability for our customers' most critical business applications, with the scale, speed and security they require. In just 2 years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig transition and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center.
Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers and as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business, while, at the same time, migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our Security business grow 11%, but our Security deferred revenue grew 26%. 
Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki cloud networking and Security. You're seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition. 
And fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT and analytics. Our recently announced acquisition of Jasper, combined with our other capabilities, is a strong example of how we will play a unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections, with the security, speed and reliability they've come to expect from Cisco. 
Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility, while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

Total reven",1061,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2%, with product revenue growth of 2% led by growth in Security, Routing and Collaboration. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms, with particular strength in mobility and web scale service providers. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by a 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our Unified communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength, growing 15%.
Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have tough comparison from Q2 '15 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.
Wireless was flat as a result of declines in our access plane controller business, offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP Video grew 37%, largely driven by strength in China. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 26%.
We had strong growth in our advanced threat, security and web security solutions, which grew over 180% and 40% respectively.
We added over 2,000 customers on our AMP, Advanced Malware solution, bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. 
Services revenue grew 3%, and we continue to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had a solid growth of 8% in total, with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product-deferred revenue, which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses, grew 34%.
In total, product orders grew 2%. Our book to bill was approximately 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat, EMEA declined 1% and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength at up 70%, with China up 64% and India up 23%.
Total emerging, minus the BRICM countries, was down 3%. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2% and Commercial grew 4%, both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public Sector was flat, and Service Provider grew 5%.
We drove strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%.
We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management. 
From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8%, with a $0.015 attributable to lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. 
From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62.
In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were 3 material items to call out which we excluded from our non-GAAP results: the gain on the sale of the SP Video CPE business; the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit; and prior year fiscal year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit.
The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. 
Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion. 
So moving on to shareholder value. In Q2, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available in the U.S.
In the first half of fiscal year '16, we have returned $4.6 billion or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends.
Today, we announced a 24% or a $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. 
We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program, raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion.
This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flow. 
Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability and operating leverage.
We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every 5 to 6 years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. 
Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth, along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses.
The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q3 fiscal year '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. We -- the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56.
We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed, coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships and our M&A capabilities, will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future.
On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed everyday by CEOs, boards and country leaders as we preview our strategy and road maps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive Security portfolio that protects them before, during and after an attack. They see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas.
They trust us, they value our innovation and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision. 
Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it's happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on 2 fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology.
Marilyn, I'll turn it back to you for questions."

Hey, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So on the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect. And our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter. And I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. And our week 10, just so you have the data point, was the end of the calendar year. So while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January. So we ended at the end of the third week of January, which, we all know, those first 3 weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. And so what I will tell you is that after week 10, through those 3 weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to just digest what was going on. They just paused a bit, and you see customers say, ""I want to just wait to see what's going on. Let me take a look at this. We want to understand this a little better."" And I think to Kelly's point, when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say, ""Hey, our infrastructure is working, so we're going to just hold on that for some period of time, and let's see where things go."" So that's probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing every day. What I would tell you, and I'll ask Kelly to comment on the -- on our guidance, is I would say that we took that sort of feeling of those first 3 weeks into consideration as we built our guidance. And that's what we based it on, is what the last 3 weeks of last quarter sort of led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments?"

I mean, we're seeing Enterprise exposed -- products trending light versus consensus, while your Service Provider products, routing, video, et cetera, beating expectations. I'd like to get your view on this Enterprise versus Service Provider dichotomy, if any. And then you have a bigger picture strategy around software and your cutting services fully believe in that strategy and model. So my question is really around do you see IT spending queuing quickly towards OpEx versus the traditional CapEx model of spending? And how would Cisco delever to this higher-than-usual OpEx IT spending moving forward?"

Thanks, Vijay. I would say if you -- the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the Enterprise and the Service Provider space, I think that what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there's uncertainty. So you see them continuing to spend in security. You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution, which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio. And I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit. So I don't view it as any -- I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the Enterprise portfolio or things like that. I think that it was largely just a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the Enterprise side. The Service Provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams had been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures, how they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think that we did that. And then I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. And so we're pleased with where we are. I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over 2 or 3 quarters, that you're going to see -- you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on, with the exception of the Enterprise customers, just prioritizing where they spent their money. As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I'll ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question. But I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they've been doing for the last 3, 4, 5, 6 quarters. So it's something that we deal with as it relates to, as an example, our Collaboration portfolio, we made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available -- or we announced it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective, and in many cases, it will be a hybrid model. So to the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we'll make that available to them. Kelly?"

On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress, whether it's in turn -- we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within Collaboration and Security, but also in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers that there are ways to monetize our services and software along that way. So we'll continue to disclose more, especially as we look at our business and it becomes a bigger part of that. But I'd say it's progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper, which are both SaaS models. We'll continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said. I'd say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is. So whether it's our Cisco Capital offer or for the ability of us to build managed service as a service, those kind of offers, we're very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption. And we have that flexibility because of our strong balance sheet. So I'd say we're making a lot of progress on both of those accounts."

What I baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our services subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses as well as some product flow-through on the distribution that we're seeing. So that's what I baked in the guidance. I am not assuming there's going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment. The sales guys are out there, the teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number. And given the spending constraint that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. So that's how I build that up. Just to remind you, back in Q3 of 2010, our growth that quarter was 27%. So it's a much different macro environment."

I think Tim alluded to it on his conference call that we're both -- both companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that joint innovation to our customers. But the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we're literally in sort of the handful stage right now. But we do see that accelerating. We have a lot of focus on it with our teams. Hans, their CEO, and I are going to be together quite a bit.

And then the other thing that we haven't really talked about is, obviously, outside the United States, we saw currency. We talked about, on the last call, in Europe and Asia, that clearly continue to maybe even get a little worse in some places. On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we've seen happening in India. We've seen tremendous success there. We have -- that's one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John has been leading for us. And our business there continues to grow very well. In China, which is the crux of your question, I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last 3 years, and I think, Brent, you and I have talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window, the team did a great job. And what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments, so not only being aligned to state owned enterprises, but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy, moving out into second-, third-tier cities, so geographic diversification. And they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio. So the good news is, what I'll tell you is, that the growth that we saw in China was very well-balanced across our portfolio.

First, on acquisitions. You guys have been fairly active in the last few quarters. Should we expect this type of pace to persist both in terms of tuck-in acquisitions and maybe more detailed acquisitions? And then the second question I had was Security. It seemed like there was some acceleration in that business this quarter. Is that just the result of the SaaS model starting to accrue to the P&L? Or was there underlying improvement in the billings and activity in that business?"

So let me comment on the M&A activity that you've seen. We have built a strategic framework that is guiding us for what we believe we need to have in our portfolio and the architectures that we need to be able to build relative to cloud, security, analytics, SaaS, IoT. We have built that framework with our team in the first 2 or 3 months that I was in the role. We then stepped back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to fill some of those opportunities, and where are there opportunities like what we saw with Jasper, where we can move and actually fill a substantive portion of our portfolio. And so that's what's driving us. It's very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to, what I believe, that our customers care about in the future. And I would say that you should expect us to continue the pace. And obviously, valuations in today's market, that's one piece of good news, is that they're more attractive. As it relates to -- all right. I'm blanking on the second part. I'm sorry. Security. Thank you. On the Security front, I would say that it is primarily, and Kelly can just again keep me honest on the deferred piece of this, if it's flowing through. But what we talked about was the integration of the Sourcefire assets as well as the Cisco assets as well as other acquisitions we made along the way, plus the other innovation that our teams internally have done. And that has -- we put all that together about 2 quarters ago when we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve, and our teams have driven that. And when you look at that Advanced Malware portfolio and we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter, so we're up to 10,000, which is -- they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy. And then during the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons. And so we're hoping for similar success. But I think, primarily, it's because of continued improvement in the portfolio and the work our team has done. I wouldn't suggest that there is a significant revenue impact coming back in from the deferred yet, although we are seeing..."

And while it is a fantastic franchise for us that has contributed and will contribute to not only our success in the data center in the past but also with our success in the next-gen data center as we build next-generation data center stacks going forward, but it also -- we also believe that, in the December quarter, that we actually still gained share with that performance. We had a tough comp from a year ago, 40%. But I'll tell you, the other thing that we looked at is that even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter that it was last quarter, that it was a quarter a year ago, which says that it just -- in my mind, it says it kind of suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro.

You saw our operating cash up 36% this quarter, that we thought we'd increase the amount of our dividend sustainably going forward. So it's a blend. We also increased our authorization just as we would normally would increase our authorization, the $15 billion. In terms of flexibility, yes, we will be accessing debt in the near future. Again, that's one of the benefits of our balance sheet, and our access to capital, it's very, very good, so we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash. But it does not change our flexibility in any way in terms of acquisitions. When we think through these capital allocation decisions, we're playing out what we're thinking about acquisition-wise, how we're building that out as well as our future cash flows.

We're getting real traction, continued traction from our engineers and supply chain on the productivity side. So for the price erosion we have, we're more than offsetting it with productivity and we're continuing to drive those projects to continue to do that, so we can have that flexibility to make sure we're taking advantage of all opportunities for growth out there. So that's continuing. On the operating margin side, again, we're going to be smart about managing the overall equation. We want to make sure we're taking advantage and investing in the right areas to be able to take advantage of future growth and balancing that equation. There is a bit of goodness coming through at the OM line because of FX favorability that you guys are aware of, that falls through the bottom line.

So I would say, as you're modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges. Take that out, that $250 million to $275 million, and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4, okay? On the software and SaaS, I know you and others ask me this question a lot. And it's tough to quantify. Certainly, it's a point or 2, easy to say, off the top. Some of the businesses -- we're growing our businesses that we've had that are great, like Collab and Security. We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers, like these big Enterprise ELAs we have.

And the second front is that we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need, and I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that's going to fundamentally change every company and every country around the world.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. 
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll also discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an expensive public disclosure. 
As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2016. As such, all the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts.
As reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. 
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn over to Chuck."
19691,334105870,988205,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 18, 2016",2016-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marilyn. We delivered strong Q3 results against the backdrop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. We continued to gene",665,"Thank you, Marilyn. 
We delivered strong Q3 results against the backdrop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid results in spite of the challenging environment.
The operational changes we continue to make will further enable our customers to leverage the strategic role to network as they transform their businesses to become digital. As I did last quarter, I'd like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. 
First, in security. We saw continued acceleration in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17%, while deferred revenue grew 31%, driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. Our security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year. As one of the largest IT security vendors, we believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective in enabling our customers to protect their businesses. Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities.
Second, collaboration. Revenue accelerated by 10%, and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example of a successful transition to a cloud-based platform, increasing our market leadership, which we expect will give us sustainable long-term differentiation.
Third, our next-generation data center portfolio is extremely well positioned to meet our customers' needs regardless of where they place their workloads, enabling public, private or hybrid cloud deployments. At our Partner Summit, we received a very strong response to our innovations, as customers adopt our next-generation data center solutions. Our strong position is evident in our installed base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI portfolio.
In March, we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance, and by this, I mean 100-gig performance for 40-gig pricing, driven by new ASICs, which provide us a time-to-market advantage of 18 to 24 months while maintaining the same margin profile.
In Q3, our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100%, while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run rate, far outpacing our next closest competitor in both sides of business and growth rate. 
Our entry into the hyperconverged market with HyperFlex as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovator in multi-cloud orchestration, extend our leadership position in the data center.
Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring, with increased emphasis on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit accelerated growth, this quarter up 36%. We have a number strong proof points for how we've executed the successful against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio.
In addition to the success I've highlighted in our security and collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in Meraki, which stands out as an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our Enterprise Networking into a subscription model.
As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we've taken with the success of Meraki, collaboration and security and apply it to our data center and core networking for both enterprise and service providers.
Our $180 billion of installed base, with by far the most widely adopted operating systems for networking, makes us uniquely positioned to lead this migration. 
While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy. At the same time, we will continue to manage our business to capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I'm very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute operationally and strategically in virtually any environment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials."

Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total reve",1031,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $12 billion, up 3%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 11%. We did have an extra week in Q3. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses and $65 million for our SaaS businesses like WebEx as well as some from our product distribution. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we continue to see good momentum with ACI and the next-generation data center. The 3% decline in switching was mostly driven by macro-related weakness in our campus business, offset by positive growth in data center switching.
Routing experienced 5% decline, mostly driven by the high end. We are seeing continued strength with our web scale customers, where our co-development continues and our sale to the top 10 web scale customers was up 31%.
Collaboration grew 10% by strength across the entire portfolio, and deferred revenue grew 16%. WebEx continued its double-digit growth, with solid performance in TelePresence and Unified Communications, driven by our new offerings in those areas. 
Data center grew 1%, with the slower growth largely driven by continued macro challenges impacting customer spend. We expect that our HyperFlex offering will further expand our growth opportunities in the data center.
Wireless grew 1%, led by strong double-digit growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform, partially offset by declines in our controller and access point businesses. 
Security grew 17%, along with continued strong deferred revenue growth of 31%. We had great performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 100% and 50%, respectively.
SP Video grew 18% with ongoing strength in China. 
Services revenue grew a very solid 11%, which includes the $200 million for the extra week I mentioned. Normalized for the extra week, the growth was 4%. 
We again saw very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8%, with product deferred revenue up 9% and service up 7%.
The portion of our product deferred revenue relating to our recurring software and construction business grew 36%.
From an orders perspective, product orders grew 3% with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run our business, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets grew 4%, with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength up 4% and China up 22% and India up 18%.
Brazil and Russia continue to be challenged, now combined representing less than 2% of our total product bookings. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, and Commercial grew 8%. Public Sector grew 6%, and Service Provider was flat. Similar to Q2, we are seeing pressure in the Enterprise segment, driven by the macro uncertainty.
We drove strong profitability this quarter, especially with gross margins. From a non-GAAP perspective, gross margin was 65.2%, with product gross margin of 64.5% and service gross margin of 67.1%. Operating expenses were 35.2% of revenue, and operating margin was 30%.
The total impact of the extra week on our non-GAAP cost to sales and operating expenses was $150 million. We are being very disciplined in this tough macro and pricing environment focused on making the right investments while driving operational efficiencies and productivity.
From a bottom line perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 6%, while GAAP EPS was $0.46. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 4%, while GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. 
We've been very active from an M&A perspective, closing 5 acquisitions in Q3: Jasper Technologies, making Cisco the largest cloud-based IoT service platform, helping enterprises and service providers launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale; Acano, which provides on-premise and cloud-based video infrastructure and collaboration software; Synata, which enables us to deliver research capabilities for collaboration cloud applications; Leaba, a fabless semiconductor company; and CliQr, which provides an application-defined cloud orchestration platform, which is expected to help Cisco customers simplify and accelerate their private, public and hybrid cloud deployments. 
These acquisitions are clearly focused on our key growth areas, including IoT, software, cloud and collaboration as well as continuing to strengthen our core. 
We've also seen solid momentum with our Ericsson partnership, closing 17 deals this quarter. 
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q3, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q3 were $63.5 billion, with $6.3 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through -- during the quarter that included $649 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 24% in Q3.
Overall, Q3 was a very solid quarter in a difficult macro environment. We focused on strong operational execution, resulting in top line growth, strong gross margins and continued operating leverage, consistent with our expectations. We're making the right investments in the growth areas of the business, balancing our decisions with sound portfolio management. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. 
The guidance for Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 0 to 3% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q4 '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.11. 
Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck."

First, I think the #1 key takeaway is that we continue to execute well even in an obviously very tough environment. 
Secondly, we've proven our ability to transition certain elements of our portfolio, like we've done with Meraki, security and collaboration. And we believe we can accelerate long-term growth by bringing the same approach to our core, and this process has begun.
And finally, everything we do will be done through a lens of enabling our customer success while driving value for our shareholders.

In the second question with regards to the gross margins. I had to go back all the way to the 2010 to find product gross margins that are equal to those that you were just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to think about what is really changing in the portfolio, whether it be through mix or change in the competitive market, anything that can justify the increase in gross margins?

So as we look at the data center business, we see a few things going on. First of all, we think that there is an impact coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw -- as our peers have, we saw some caution, and I would say, the CapEx spend in the SP space. And that was an area -- that was one of the segments that we saw weakness this quarter even with our data center portfolio. When we say data center in this context, we're talking about UCS in particular. The other thing that's going on is there is a transition going on in the data center relative to workloads. I talked a little bit about it on the last call. We see workload-specific use cases being deployed on high-performance blade, systems like our classic UCS. Then we see also this move to hyperconverged systems, which led us to the launch of our HyperFlex platform last quarter. We also see a transition to rack-based systems, which also results in stacks that are driven by container-based architectures. And so in the past quarter, 30% of our UCS business was actually from our rack portfolio, which we do have for the appropriate use cases. And you'll see us continue to expand our offering. So we have UCS as a blade system. We have a rack version of UCS. We have HyperFlex in the market. And then you'll see us continue to expand our portfolio to meet the evolving use cases in the data center. I think that's what's going on the right now. Kelly, on the gross margin question?"

And normalized, if you go back to just Q1 of this year, we were at a 64 9 [ph]. And we had -- even last year, we had a 65.1. So I'd say, it's kind of the new normal in that 63, 64 range. I would say, the only other thing, when you go back and you update your models for the extra week, because a lot of the top line that I talked about comes off the balance sheet, and there's not incremental cost. I did get a 0.5 point benefit just from the extra week in my gross margin. So I'd say a normalized view on the gross margin would have been closer to 64.5."

Our Meraki business, which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud-based management and policy is over $1 billion now and growing double digits. And I think that we -- the thing I'm most excited about longer-term is we see a path to deploying that model across the rest of our portfolio. And again, that work has begun. I think in the near term, we see, obviously, a mix of a pretty cautious environment still because we do see customers spending where they need to spend. But don't misunderstand, there's still a fair amount of caution in the market. But I think that we've executed well this quarter. We had 5 of our 7 product categories that were in positive growth, with 3 of those in double digits. We had all the geos in positive growth from an order perspective. And we saw pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question. Second one relative to security, the answer is yes, yes and yes. We will continue investing both organically and any other way that we see appropriate to drive that architecture. The team's done a phenomenal job."

So on the Switching business, I'll point out a couple of things. Last quarter, we indicated that our campus switching business, the growth there is largely driven by refresh, which, in an uncertain times, enterprises that have infrastructure that's functioning for them, they're not going to make the move to a great. So we see a pause in that the refresh cycle, which we talked about last quarter, and nothing really changed there. What we did see is we saw our data center switching revenue growth increase. And the other thing that I'll point out is that we had indicated that we believe that our data center switching growth would -- the new product portfolio, would surpass the declines of the traditional products that we've had. And our order growth rates, which we haven't put in any of the documentation, but our order growth rate this past quarter, on that $4 billion portfolio, was double digits. So we're pleased with the progress that we made in the data center switching space. And again, that's $4 billion, and it grew double digits in orders. So we feel okay about that. On the routing front, I think it's a combination of things. I think that there's certainly $1 billion in the quarter. $1 billion in the quarter, $4 billion annualized run rate on the data center switching. Kelly's making sure we're clear. On the routing business, we've seen a few things. Clearly, there's a macro issue that we're dealing with. We also saw, again, as you heard from some of our peers, we saw some increased caution the Service Provider space. We saw a slow movement in the core of those networks, kind of flattish activity at the edge. And we do have a number of new platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that we, at some point, in the coming quarters, we would expect those to begin to show up favorably.

We do have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out. So always, Q1 and Q3 are strongest gross margin quarters. And Q2 and Q4 are weaker, and that's typically driven by our mix, especially mix of service and those 2 quarters. So that's also a driver. And I think just operationally speaking, again, the teams are doing a very good job from a productivity perspective in terms of driving costs out of the product. We have a lot of efficiencies out of the supply chain in terms of managing our freight and our inventory management. So I'd say, there's just been real -- we had a very strong quarter from operational excellence. If I look at pricing this quarter, we are being very disciplined on pricing. We're starting to see a tiny bit of a tick-up, and you'll see that in our Q, where the impact to our gross margin rate, year-to-date, is about 2.2 points and Q3 was 2.4.

Let me, first of all, say that I think over the last few quarters, Joe Cozzolino and his team have been incredibly focused on driving the operational excellence around the P&L element of that, which is what you're seeing with the gross margins and I think some of the discussion I had earlier around the focus on the renewal capability. I think we're seeing generally improvement in the execution there. We see Advanced Services obviously doing reasonably well, security Services doing reasonably well. And as I mentioned earlier, the renewal activity, our team's did a better job this past quarter. So I think a lot of what you've seen is operational discipline and execution, to be honest. However, I think that there is an opportunity, and more of our customers are asking us to help them, as they look at their strategies, to take advantage of this digital transition that's occurring. I'm not sure that I'm in the position where I would give you any sort of tangible connection between it and future product growth.

So I'll let Kelly tackle the second question. If you look at where we declared -- when we stated our strategies around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe is going to be long-term desire of our customers, which is to operate in a hybrid cloud model. And we said that we're going to do 3 primary things. We're going to make sure that we provide the infrastructure to the cloud providers, and we've done that with SPs, and we've done that obviously with the top 10 web scale providers, given the business was up 31%. We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud-delivered and as-a-service delivered, where it makes sense, and overtime across the entire portfolio. And you've seen us do that with our continued growth in Meraki, in collaboration and security. And now the plans -- we're actually underway on a project to deploy that across the rest of our portfolio, although it's early days. But I think when you look at that deferred revenue of 36% on the balance sheet, that says that we were being successful in the second pillar. And then the third pillar was to help our customers with the infrastructure needed to actually take advantage of both private and public clouds or enabling hybrid. And when you look at the data center switching portfolio, on an annualized $4 billion business with new orders growing in double digits, I think that customers are driving both. And I think that the 3 pillars of that strategy are working. As far as gross margins, when we sell to private cloud versus public cloud providers, Kelly, any comment there?"

And between campus and the data center side, we're within 5 to 6 points of gross margin. So the differentiation is not much there. We can have variations within that. We have some public cloud customers, have some deals that might have better or worse margins. But overall, the portfolio is within those ranges.

And so coming into that earnings call, we had seen a very tough close to the quarter from an orders perspective. We saw our Enterprise customers in particular really put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire. And I think that led us to a very cautious tone. And so that would be the #1 reason why we were more cautious then. I just want to -- I want to make sure that we are balanced here, that while we're optimistic and we are pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively uncertain environment. We got the [indiscernible] coming up, the vote coming up in June. We got the news out of the Fed today. We've got all the election dynamics. We got issues in Brazil. We've got geopolitical dynamics. So there's still a relatively broad set of unknown issues out there.

And I think this is sort of in the same vein of it's all about cloud. It's all like they're all about SDN or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a technology trend, their underlying business drivers that are leading them to these solutions. And so what we've been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes about. So in the case of the web scale players, what they're looking at is they're looking for significant automation. They're looking for the ability to run massive data centers at very -- at huge scale, very low cost with a ton of automation, which, over time, will become the norm, I think, for all customers. There's this massive focus on operational expense reduction, which is all around automation, programmability, which is where we're headed with our core platforms in the Enterprise as well. So what we did is we built some really aggressive products. Our teams, again, the ASICs improvement that have been built that give us the advantage on the price performance and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the operational environments of these customers, I think, has been the key. And that's what they're looking for. They're not singularly focused on white box. They are looking at how do they solve that problem. And we're just spending more time with him to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements, and you're going to see us continue to evolve our portfolio on whatever way we need to make sure that we remain relevant there."

And I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now in the midst of the uncertainty that's being discussed in the marketplace. On the Inspur partnership, in September, we signed the MOU, which was basically a Letter of Intent to formulate the venture. And that was over 3 weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically, and we're in the final stages of getting that. When put together, I would expect that we'll be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think sort of late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that. I think on the Erickson front, anytime we do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably than the what all hope, but we're very optimistic. We spent a ton of time together I think on the last call, we talked about the number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at Mobile World Congress, which was pretty amazing. And in this past quarter, we saw 17 transactions close between our teams, which in the midst of a time where Hans was doing a pretty significant organizational restructuring.

We're focused on the execution and the operational excellence, and at the same time, we're focus on transitioning our business and investing in the future, which I think was displayed by our progress in the different areas that I highlighted during the call today.
I think that, again, if you look at our success in security and collaboration next-gen data center, the Meraki cloud networking platform and, overall, in our transition to software and subscription, I think we're on that journey. We've proven that we can transition elements of our portfolio, and we're going to apply that same approach significant to the rest of our business. We're in the early days on the front end of a long journey, but I'm pleased with where we are. 
So I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today, and I look forward to talking to use them. Marilyn?"

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. 
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll also discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. 
As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2016. As such, all the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts.
As reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. 
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn over to Chuck."

We delivered strong Q3 results against the backdrop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid results in spite of the challenging environment.
The operational changes we continue to make will further enable our customers to leverage strategic role of the network as they transform their businesses to become digital. As I did last quarter, I'd like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. 
First, in security. We saw continued acceleration in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17%, while deferred revenue grew 31%, driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. Our security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year. As one of the largest IT security vendors, we believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective in enabling our customers to protect their businesses. Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities.
Second, collaboration. Revenue accelerated by 10%, and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example of a successful transition to a cloud-based platform, increasing our market leadership, which we expect will give us sustainable long-term differentiation.
Third, our next-generation data center portfolio is extremely well positioned to meet our customers' needs regardless of where they place their workloads, enabling public, private or hybrid cloud deployments. At our Partner Summit, we received a very strong response to our innovations, as customers adopt our next-generation data center solutions. Our strong position is evident in our installed base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI portfolio.
In March, we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance, and by this, I mean 100-gig performance for 40-gig pricing, driven by new ASICs, which provide us a time-to-market advantage of 18 to 24 months while maintaining the same margin profile.
In Q3, our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100%, while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run rate, far outpacing our next closest competitor in both sides of business and growth rate. 
Our entry into the hyperconverged market with HyperFlex as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovator in multi-cloud orchestration, extend our leadership position in the data center.
Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring, with increased emphasis on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit accelerated growth, this quarter up 36%. We have a number of strong proof points for how we've executed successfully against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio.
In addition to the success I've highlighted in our security and collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in Meraki, which stands out as an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our Enterprise Networking into a subscription model.
As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we've taken with the success of Meraki, collaboration and security and apply it to our data center and core networking for both enterprise and service providers.
Our $180 billion of installed base, with by far the most widely adopted operating systems for networking, makes us uniquely positioned to lead this migration. 
While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy. At the same time, we will continue to manage our business to capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I'm very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute operationally and strategically in virtually any environment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials."

Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total reve",1032,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $12 billion, up 3%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 11%. We did have an extra week in Q3. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx as well as some from our product distribution. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we continue to see good momentum with ACI and the next-generation data center. The 3% decline in switching was mostly driven by macro-related weakness in our campus business, offset by positive growth in data center switching.
Routing experienced 5% decline, mostly driven by the high end. We are seeing continued strength with our web scale customers, where our co-development continues and our sale to the top 10 web scale customers was up 31%.
Collaboration grew 10% by strength across the entire portfolio, and deferred revenue grew 16%. WebEx continued its double-digit growth, with solid performance in TelePresence and Unified Communications, driven by our new offerings in those areas. 
Data center grew 1%, with the slower growth largely driven by continued macro challenges impacting customer spend. We expect that our HyperFlex offering will further expand our growth opportunities in the data center. Wireless grew 1%, led by strong double-digit growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform, partially offset by declines in our controller and access point businesses. 
Security grew 17%, along with continued strong deferred revenue growth of 31%. We had great performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 100% and 50%, respectively.
SP Video grew 18% with ongoing strength in China. Services revenue grew a very solid 11%, which includes the $200 million for the extra week I mentioned. Normalized for the extra week, the growth was 4%. 
We again saw very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8%, with product deferred revenue up 9% and service up 7%.
The portion of our product deferred revenue relating to our recurring software and subscription business grew 36%. From an orders perspective, product orders grew 3% with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets grew 4%, with the BRICS plus Mexico showing strength up 4% and China up 22% and India up 18%. Brazil and Russia continue to be challenged, and now combined representing less than 2% of our total product bookings. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, and Commercial grew 8%. Public Sector grew 6%, and Service Provider was flat. Similar to Q2, we are seeing pressure in the Enterprise segment, driven by the macro uncertainty.
We drove strong profitability this quarter, especially with gross margins. From a non-GAAP perspective, gross margin was 65.2%, with product gross margin of 64.5% and service gross margin of 67.1%. Operating expenses were 35.2% of revenue, and operating margin was 30%.
The total impact of the extra week on our non-GAAP cost to sales and operating expenses was $150 million. We are being very disciplined in this tough macro and pricing environment focused on making the right investments while driving operational efficiencies and productivity.
From a bottom line perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 6%, while GAAP EPS was $0.46. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 4%, while GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. 
We've been very active from an M&A perspective, closing 5 acquisitions in Q3: Jasper Technologies, making Cisco the largest cloud-based IoT service platform, helping enterprises and service providers launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale; Acano, which provides on-premise and cloud-based video infrastructure and collaboration software; Synata, which enables us to deliver search capabilities for collaboration cloud applications; Leaba, a fabless semiconductor company; and CliQr, which provides an application-defined cloud orchestration platform, which is expected to help Cisco customers simplify and accelerate their private, public and hybrid cloud deployments. 
These acquisitions are clearly focused on our key growth areas, including IoT, software, cloud and collaboration as well as continuing to strengthen our core. We've also seen solid momentum with our Ericsson partnership, closing 17 deals this quarter. 
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q3, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q3 were $63.5 billion, with $6.3 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through -- during the quarter that included $649 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 24% in Q3.
Overall, Q3 was a very solid quarter in a difficult macro environment. We focused on strong operational execution, resulting in top line growth, strong gross margins and continued operating leverage, consistent with our expectations. We're making the right investments in the growth areas of the business, balancing our decisions with sound portfolio management. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. 
The guidance for Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 0% to 3% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q4 '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.11. 
Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck."

And the second question with regards to the gross margins. I had to go back all the way to 2010 to find product gross margins that are equal to those that you just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to think about what is really changing in the portfolio, whether it be through mix or change in the competitive environment, anything that can justify the increase in gross margins?

So as we look at the data center business, we see a few things going on. First of all, we think that there is an impact coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw -- as our peers have, we saw some caution, and I would say, the CapEx spend in the SP space, and that was an area -- that was one of the segments that we saw weakness this quarter even with our data center portfolio. When we say data center in this context, we're talking about UCS in particular. The other thing that's going on is there is a transition going on in the data center relative to workloads. I talked a little bit about it on the last call. We see workload-specific use cases being deployed on high-performance blade, systems like our classic UCS. Then we see also this move to hyperconverged systems, which led us to the launch of our HyperFlex platform last quarter. We also see a transition to rack-based systems, which also results in stacks that are driven by container-based architectures. And so in the past quarter, 30% of our UCS business was actually from our rack portfolio, which we do have for the appropriate use cases. And you'll see us continue to expand our offering. So we have UCS as a blade system. We have a rack version of UCS. We have HyperFlex in the market. And you'll see us continue to expand our portfolio to meet the evolving use cases in the data center. I think that's what's going on the right now. Kelly, on the gross margin question?"

I would say, the only other thing, when you go back and you update your models for the extra week, because a lot of the top line that I talked about comes off the balance sheet, and there's no incremental cost. I did get a 0.5 point benefit just from the extra week in my gross margin. So I'd say a normalized view on the gross margin would have been closer to 64.5%."

Our Meraki business, which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud-based management and policy is over $1 billion now and growing double digits. And I think that we -- the thing I'm most excited about longer term is we see a path to deploying that model across the rest of our portfolio. And again, that work has begun. I think in the near term, we see, obviously, a mix of a pretty cautious environment still because we do see customers spending where they need to spend. But don't misunderstand, there's still a fair amount of caution in the market. But I think that we've executed well this quarter. We had 5 of our 7 product categories that were in positive growth, with 3 of those in double digits. We had all the geos in positive growth from an order perspective. And we saw pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question. Second one relative to security, the answer is yes, yes and yes.

Last quarter, we indicated that our campus switching business, the growth there is largely driven by refresh, which, in an uncertain times, enterprises that have infrastructure that's functioning for them, they're not going to make the move to upgrade. So we see a pause in that refresh cycle, which we talked about last quarter, and nothing really changed there. What we did see is we saw our data center switching revenue growth increase. And the other thing that I'll point out is that we had indicated that we believe that our data center switching growth would -- the new product portfolio would surpass the declines of the traditional products that we've had. And our order growth rates, which we haven't put in any of the documentation, but our order growth rate this past quarter, on that $4 billion portfolio, was double digits. So we're pleased with the progress that we made in the data center switching space. And again, that's $4 billion, and it grew double digits in orders. So we feel okay about that. On the routing front, I think it's a combination of things. I think that there's certainly $1 billion in the quarter. $1 billion in the quarter, $4 billion annualized run rate on the data center switching. Kelly's making sure we're clear. On the routing business, we've seen a few things. Clearly, there's a macro issue that we're dealing with. We also saw, again, as you heard from some of our peers, we saw some increased caution in the Service Provider space. We saw a slow movement in the core of those networks, kind of flattish activity at the edge. And we do have a number of new platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that we, at some point, in the coming quarters, we would expect those to begin to show up favorably. But that's what we see right now."

So even if enterprises are holding on to their switches and routers longer, our services team and sales team have been focused on getting the contracts renewed. And we're seeing that pay dividends with the acceleration of growth. Again, if you normalize our service revenue growth this quarter for the extra week, they still grew 4%, which is up from 3% year-over-year growth in Q2 and it was 1% in Q1. So we're really starting to get traction there."

So again, the thing to keep in mind, true, we did guide with extra week which came in line. But just, again, a couple of things. When we guide, we tend to have a little conservatism in the gross margin rate. But take off that 0.5 point, we're still parked at the 64.5% range. We do have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out. So always, Q1 and Q3 are strongest gross margin quarters. And Q2 and Q4 are weaker, and it's typically driven by our mix, especially mix of servers in those 2 quarters. So that's also a driver. And I think just operationally speaking, again, the teams are doing a very good job from a productivity perspective in terms of driving costs out of the product. We have a lot of efficiencies out of the supply chain in terms of managing our freight and our inventory management. So I'd say, there's just been real -- we had a very strong quarter from operational excellence. If I look at pricing this quarter, we are being very disciplined on pricing. We're starting to see a tiny bit of a tick-up, and you'll see that in our Q, where the impact to our gross margin rate, year-to-date, is about 2.2 points and Q3 was 2.4. So still strong, but we are still seeing price erosion. But again, the strength we're seeing this quarter mostly came from this improvement in productivity."

So I'll let Kelly tackle the second question. If you look at where we declared -- when we stated our strategy is around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe is going to be long-term desire of our customers, which is to operate in a hybrid cloud model. And we said that we're going to do 3 primary things. We're going to make sure that we provide the infrastructure to the cloud providers, and we've done that with SPs, and we've done that obviously with the top 10 web scale providers, given the business was up 31%. We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud-delivered and as-a-service delivered, where it makes sense, and over time across the entire portfolio. And you've seen us do that with our continued growth in Meraki, in collaboration and security. And now the plans -- we're actually underway on a project to deploy that across the rest of our portfolio, although it's early days. But I think when you look at that deferred revenue of 36% on the balance sheet, that says that we were being successful in the second pillar. And then the third pillar was to help our customers with the infrastructure needed to actually take advantage of both private and public clouds or enabling hybrid. And when you look at the data center switching portfolio, on an annualized $4 billion business with new orders growing in double digits, I think that customers are driving both. And I think that the 3 pillars of that strategy are working. As far as gross margins, when we sell to private cloud versus public cloud providers, Kelly, any comment there?"

We have some public cloud customers on some deals that might have better or worse margins. But overall, the portfolio is within those ranges. And again, way accretive to the overall Cisco margins."

What makes you so much more positive now versus 3 months ago in a similar environment? Or unless maybe the environment gotten better."

I think the difference is if you go back to when we ended our last quarter, it was towards the end of January. And if you recall, the last few weeks of that quarter were the weeks when the stock markets were having those incredibly wild swings, and our customers actually put the brakes on pretty significantly. And so coming into that earnings call, we had seen a very tough close to the quarter from an orders perspective. We saw our Enterprise customers in particular really put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire. And I think that led us to a very cautious tone. And so that would be the #1 reason why we were more cautious then. I just want to -- I want to make sure that we are balanced here, that while we're optimistic and we're pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively uncertain environment. We got the [indiscernible] coming up, the vote coming up in June. We got the news out of the Fed today. We've got all the election dynamics. We got issues in Brazil. We've got geopolitical dynamics. So there's still a relatively broad set of unknown issues out there. So we're still operating in an uncertain environment, but I think the stock market issue and the timing of the end of our last quarter would probably be the biggest difference."

And I think this is sort of in the same vein of -- it's all about cloud. It's like are all about SDN or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a technology trend, their underlying business drivers that are leading them to these solutions. And so what we've been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes about. So in the case of the web scale players, what they're looking at is they're looking for significant automation. They're looking for the ability to run massive data centers at very -- at huge scale, very low cost with a ton of automation, which, over time, will become the norm, I think, for all customers. There's this massive focus on operational expense reduction, which is all around automation, programmability, which is where we're headed with our core platforms in the Enterprise as well. So what we did is we built some really aggressive products. Our teams, again, the ASICs improvement that have been built that give us the advantage on the price performance and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the operational environments of these customers, I think, has been the key. And that's what they're looking for. They're not singularly focused on white box. They are looking at how do they solve that problem. And we're just spending more time with them to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements, and you're going to see us continue to evolve our portfolio on whatever way we need to, to make sure that we remain relevant there."

And I will point out that, that is across the board. It's across the portfolio. The team has done an amazing job there. And I've spent a fair amount of time over there. And I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now in the midst of the uncertainty that's being discussed in the marketplace. On the Inspur partnership, in September, we signed the MoU, which was basically a letter of intent to formulate the venture. And that was over 3 weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically, and we're in the final stages of getting that one put together. I would expect that we'll be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think sort of late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that. I think on the Ericsson front, anytime you do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably than we would all hope, but we're very optimistic. We spent a ton of time together. I think on the last call, we talked about a number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at Mobile World Congress, which was pretty amazing. And in this past quarter, we saw 17 transactions close between our teams, which in the midst of a time where Hans was doing a pretty significant organizational restructuring. And our teams are getting to know each other. So we think that we all want it to go faster. But we're pretty pleased with where that partnership is right now."

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. 
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll also discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. 
As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2016. As such, all the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts.
As reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.

We delivered strong Q3 results against the backdrop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid results in spite of the challenging environment.
The operational changes we continue to make will further enable our customers to leverage strategic role of the network as they transform their businesses to become digital. As I did last quarter, I'd like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. 
First, in security. We saw continued acceleration in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17%, while deferred revenue grew 31%, driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. Our security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year. As one of the largest IT security vendors, we believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective in enabling our customers to protect their businesses. Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities.
Second, collaboration. Revenue accelerated by 10%, and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example of a successful transition to a cloud-based platform, increasing our market leadership, which we expect will give us sustainable long-term differentiation.
Third, our next-generation data center portfolio is extremely well positioned to meet our customers' needs regardless of where they place their workloads, enabling public, private or hybrid cloud deployments. At our Partner Summit, we received a very strong response to our innovations, as customers adopt our next-generation data center solutions. Our strong position is evident in our installed base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI portfolio.
In March, we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance, and by this, I mean 100-gig performance for 40-gig pricing, driven by new ASICs, which provide us a time-to-market advantage of 18 to 24 months while maintaining the same margin profile.
In Q3, our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100%, while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run rate, far outpacing our next closest competitor in both sides of business and growth rate. 
Our entry into the hyperconverged market with HyperFlex as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovator in multi-cloud orchestration, extend our leadership position in the data center.
Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring, with increased emphasis on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit accelerated growth, this quarter up 36%. We have a number of strong proof points for how we've executed successfully against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio.
In addition to the success I've highlighted in our security and collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in Meraki, which stands out as an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our Enterprise Networking into a subscription model.
As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we've taken with the success of Meraki, collaboration and security and apply it to our data center and core networking for both enterprise and service providers.
Our $180 billion of installed base, with by far the most widely adopted operating systems for networking, makes us uniquely positioned to lead this migration. 
While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy. At the same time, we will continue to manage our business to capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I'm very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute operationally and strategically in virtually any environment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials."

Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total reve",1032,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $12 billion, up 3%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 11%. We did have an extra week in Q3. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx as well as some from our product distribution. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we continue to see good momentum with ACI and the next-generation data center. The 3% decline in switching was mostly driven by macro-related weakness in our campus business, offset by positive growth in data center switching.
Routing experienced 5% decline, mostly driven by the high end. We are seeing continued strength with our web scale customers, where our co-developments continue and our sale to the top 10 web scale customers was up 31%.
Collaboration grew 10% by strength across the entire portfolio, and deferred revenue grew 16%. WebEx continued its double-digit growth, with solid performance in TelePresence and Unified Communications, driven by our new offerings in those areas. 
Data center grew 1%, with the slower growth largely driven by continued macro challenges impacting customer spend. We expect that our HyperFlex offering will further expand our growth opportunities in the data center. Wireless grew 1%, led by strong double-digit growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform, partially offset by declines in our controller and access point businesses. 
Security grew 17%, along with continued strong deferred revenue growth of 31%. We had great performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 100% and 50%, respectively.
SP Video grew 18% with ongoing strength in China. Services revenue grew a very solid 11%, which includes the $200 million for the extra week I mentioned. Normalized for the extra week, the growth was 4%. 
We again saw very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8%, with product deferred revenue up 9% and service up 7%.
The portion of our product deferred revenue relating to our recurring software and subscription business grew 36%. From an orders perspective, product orders grew 3% with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets grew 4%, with the BRICS plus Mexico showing strength up 4% and China up 22% and India up 18%. Brazil and Russia continue to be challenged, and now combined representing less than 2% of our total product bookings. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, and Commercial grew 8%. Public Sector grew 6%, and Service Provider was flat. Similar to Q2, we are seeing pressure in the Enterprise segment, driven by the macro uncertainty.
We drove strong profitability this quarter, especially with gross margins. From a non-GAAP perspective, gross margin was 65.2%, with product gross margin of 64.5% and service gross margin of 67.1%. Operating expenses were 35.2% of revenue, and operating margin was 30%.
The total impact of the extra week on our non-GAAP cost to sales and operating expenses was $150 million. We are being very disciplined in this tough macro and pricing environment focused on making the right investments while driving operational efficiencies and productivity.
From a bottom line perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 6%, while GAAP EPS was $0.46. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 4%, while GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. 
We've been very active from an M&A perspective, closing 5 acquisitions in Q3: Jasper Technologies, making Cisco the largest cloud-based IoT service platform, helping enterprises and service providers launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale; Acano, which provides on-premise and cloud-based video infrastructure and collaboration software; Synata, which enables us to deliver search capabilities for collaboration cloud applications; Leaba, a fabless semiconductor company; and CliQr, which provides an application-defined cloud orchestration platform, which is expected to help Cisco customers simplify and accelerate their private, public and hybrid cloud deployments. 
These acquisitions are clearly focused on our key growth areas, including IoT, software, cloud and collaboration as well as continuing to strengthen our core. We've also seen solid momentum with our Ericsson partnership, closing 17 deals this quarter. 
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q3, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q3 were $63.5 billion, with $6.3 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through -- during the quarter that included $649 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 24% in Q3.
Overall, Q3 was a very solid quarter in a difficult macro environment. We focused on strong operational execution, resulting in top line growth, strong gross margins and continued operating leverage, consistent with our expectations. We're making the right investments in the growth areas of the business, balancing our decisions with sound portfolio management. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. 
The guidance for Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 0% to 3% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q4 '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.11. 
Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck."

And this business has accounted for about 1/3 of your growth in the past few years. So if you could give us a little bit more color as to why isn't this moving, that would be great. And the second question with regards to the gross margins. I had to go back all the way to 2010 to find product gross margins that are equal to those that you just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to think about what is really changing in the portfolio, whether it be through mix or change in the competitive environment, anything that can justify the increase in gross margins? And how sustainable do you think that is?"

So as we look at the data center business, we see a few things going on. First of all, we think that there is an impact coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw -- as our peers have, we saw some caution, in I would say, the CapEx spend in the SP space, and that was an area -- that was one of the segments that we saw weakness this quarter even with our data center portfolio. When we say data center in this context, we're talking about UCS in particular. The other thing that's going on is there is a transition going on in the data center relative to workloads. I talked a little bit about it on the last call. We see workload-specific use cases being deployed on high-performance blade, systems like our classic UCS. Then we see also this move to hyperconverged systems, which led us to the launch of our HyperFlex platform last quarter. We also see a transition to rack-based systems, which also result in stacks that are driven by container-based architectures. And so in the past quarter, 30% of our UCS business was actually from our rack portfolio, which we do have for the appropriate use cases. And you'll see us continue to expand our offering. So we have UCS as a blade system. We have a rack version of UCS. We have HyperFlex in the market. And you'll see us continue to expand our portfolio to meet the evolving use cases in the data center. I think that's what's going on the right now. Kelly, on the gross margin question?"

I would say, the only other thing, when you go back and you update your models for the extra week, because a lot of the top line that I talked about comes off the balance sheet, and there's no incremental cost, I did get a 0.5 point benefit just from the extra week in my gross margin.

Our Meraki business, which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud-based management and policy is over $1 billion now and growing double digits. And I think that we -- the thing I'm most excited about longer term is we see a path to deploying that model across the rest of our portfolio. And again, that work has begun. I think in the near term, we see, obviously, a mix of a pretty cautious environment still because we do see customers spending where they need to spend. But don't misunderstand, there's still a fair amount of caution in the market. But I think that we've executed well this quarter. We had 5 of our 7 product categories that were in positive growth, with 3 of those in double digits. We had all the geos in positive growth from an order perspective. And we saw pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question. Second one relative to security, the answer is yes, yes and yes. We will continue investing both organically and any other way that we see appropriate to drive that architecture. The team's done a phenomenal job."

So on the switching business, I'll point out a couple of things. Last quarter, we indicated that our campus switching business, the growth there is largely driven by refresh, which, in an uncertain times, enterprises that have infrastructure that's functioning for them, they're not going to make the move to upgrade. So we see a pause in that refresh cycle, which we talked about last quarter, and nothing really changed there. What we did see is we saw our data center switching revenue growth increase. And the other thing that I'll point out is that we had indicated that we believe that our data center switching growth would -- the new product portfolio would surpass the declines of the traditional products that we've had. And our order growth rates, which we haven't put in any of the documentation, but our order growth rate this past quarter, on that $4 billion portfolio, was double digits. So we're pleased with the progress that we made in the data center switching space. And again, that's $4 billion, and it grew double digits in orders. So we feel okay about that. On the routing front, I think it's a combination of things. I think that there's certainly $1 billion in the quarter. $1 billion in the quarter, $4 billion annualized run rate on the data center switching. Kelly's making sure we're clear. On the routing business, we've seen a few things. Clearly, there's a macro issue that we're dealing with. We also saw, again, as you heard from some of our peers, we saw some increased caution in the Service Provider space. We saw a slow movement in the core of those networks, kind of flattish activity at the edge. And we do have a number of new platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that we, at some point, in the coming quarters, we would expect those to begin to show up favorably.

We do have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out. So always, Q1 and Q3 are strongest gross margin quarters. And Q2 and Q4 are weaker, and it's typically driven by our mix, especially mix of servers in those 2 quarters. So that's also a driver. And I think just operationally speaking, again, the teams are doing a very good job from a productivity perspective in terms of driving costs out of the product. We have a lot of efficiencies out of the supply chain in terms of managing our freight and our inventory management. So I'd say, there's just been real -- we had a very strong quarter from operational excellence. If I look at pricing this quarter, we are being very disciplined on pricing. We're starting to see a tiny bit of a tick-up, and you'll see that in our Q, where the impact to our gross margin rate, year-to-date, is about 2.2 points and Q3 was 2.4.

If you look at what we declared when we stated our strategies around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe is going to be long-term desire of our customers, which is to operate in a hybrid cloud model. And we said that we're going to do 3 primary things. We're going to make sure that we provide the infrastructure to the cloud providers, and we've done that with SPs, and we've done that obviously with the top 10 web scale providers, given the business was up 31%. We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud-delivered and as-a-service delivered, where it makes sense, and over time across the entire portfolio.

And now the plans -- we're actually underway on a project to deploy that across the rest of our portfolio, although it's early days.

We have some public cloud customers on some deals that might have better or worse margins. But overall, the portfolio is within those ranges. And again, way accretive to the overall Cisco margins."

I think the difference is if you go back to when we ended our last quarter, it was towards the end of January.

And so coming into that earnings call, we had seen a very tough close to the quarter from an orders perspective. We saw our Enterprise customers in particular really put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire. And I think that led us to a very cautious tone. And so that would be the #1 reason why we were more cautious then. I just want to -- I want to make sure that we are balanced here, that while we're optimistic and we're pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively uncertain environment. We got the Brexit coming up, the vote coming up in June. We got the news out of the Fed today. We've got all the election dynamics. We got issues in Brazil. We've got geopolitical dynamics. So there's still a relatively broad set of unknown issues out there.

And I think this is sort of in the same vein of -- it's all about cloud. It's like -- or all about SDN or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a technology trend. There are underlying business drivers that are leading them to these solutions. And so what we've been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes about. So in the case of the web scale players, what they're looking at is they're looking for significant automation. They're looking for the ability to run massive data centers at very -- at huge scale, very low cost with a ton of automation, which, over time, will become the norm, I think, for all customers. There's this massive focus on operational expense reduction, which is all around automation, programmability, which is where we're headed with our core platforms in the Enterprise as well. So what we did is we built some really aggressive products. Our teams, again, the ASICs improvement that have been built that give us the advantage on the price performance and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the operational environments of these customers, I think, has been the key. And that's what they're looking for. They're not singularly focused on white box. They are looking at how do they solve that problem. And we're just spending more time with them to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements, and you're going to see us continue to evolve our portfolio in whatever way we need to, to make sure that we remain relevant there."

And I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now in the midst of the uncertainty that's being discussed in the marketplace. On the Inspur partnership, in September, we signed the MoU, which was basically a letter of intent to formulate the venture. And I was over 3 weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically, and we're in the final stages of getting that one put together. I would expect that we'll be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think sort of late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that. I think on the Ericsson front, anytime you do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably than we would all hope, but we're very optimistic. We spent a ton of time together. I think on the last call, we talked about a number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at Mobile World Congress, which was pretty amazing. And in this past quarter, we saw 17 transactions close between our teams, which in the midst of a time where Hans was doing a pretty significant organizational restructuring.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. 
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll also discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. 
As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2016. As such, all the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts.
As reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.

19691,334105870,989049,"Cisco Systems, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 18, 2016",2016-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Cisco Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marilyn. We delivered strong Q3 results against the backdrop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain.

We delivered strong Q3 results against the backdrop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid results in spite of the challenging environment.
The operational changes we continue to make will further enable our customers to leverage strategic role of the network as they transform their businesses to become digital. As I did last quarter, I'd like to highlight our momentum in 4 key areas. 
First, in security. We saw continued acceleration in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17%, while deferred revenue grew 31%, driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. Our security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year. As one of the largest IT security vendors, we believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective in enabling our customers to protect their businesses. Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities.
Second, collaboration. Revenue accelerated by 10%, and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example of a successful transition to a cloud-based platform, increasing our market leadership, which we expect will give us sustainable long-term differentiation.
Third, our next-generation data center portfolio is extremely well positioned to meet our customers' needs regardless of where they place their workloads, enabling public, private or hybrid cloud deployments. At our Partner Summit, we received a very strong response to our innovations, as customers adopt our next-generation data center solutions. Our strong position is evident in our installed base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI portfolio.
In March, we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance, and by this, I mean 100-gig performance for 40-gig pricing, driven by new ASICs, which provide us a time-to-market advantage of 18 to 24 months while maintaining the same margin profile.
In Q3, our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100%, while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run rate, far outpacing our next closest competitor in both sides of business and growth rate. 
Our entry into the hyperconverged market with HyperFlex as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovator in multi-cloud orchestration, extend our leadership position in the data center.
Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring, with increased emphasis on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit accelerated growth, this quarter up 36%. We have a number of strong proof points for how we've executed successfully against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio.
In addition to the success I've highlighted in our security and collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in Meraki, which stands out as an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our Enterprise Networking into a subscription model.
As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we've taken with the success of Meraki, collaboration and security and apply it to our data center and core networking for both enterprise and service providers.
Our $180 billion of installed base, with by far the most widely adopted operating systems for networking, makes us uniquely positioned to lead this migration. 
While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy. At the same time, we will continue to manage our business to capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I'm very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute operationally and strategically in virtually any environment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials."

Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total reve",1032,"Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $12 billion, up 3%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 11%. We did have an extra week in Q3. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx as well as some from our product distribution. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we continue to see good momentum with ACI and the next-generation data center. The 3% decline in switching was mostly driven by macro-related weakness in our campus business, offset by positive growth in data center switching.
Routing experienced 5% decline, mostly driven by the high end. We are seeing continued strength with our web scale customers, where our co-developments continue and our sale to the top 10 web scale customers was up 31%.
Collaboration grew 10% by strength across the entire portfolio, and deferred revenue grew 16%. WebEx continued its double-digit growth, with solid performance in TelePresence and Unified Communications, driven by our new offerings in those areas. 
Data center grew 1%, with the slower growth largely driven by continued macro challenges impacting customer spend. We expect that our HyperFlex offering will further expand our growth opportunities in the data center. Wireless grew 1%, led by strong double-digit growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform, partially offset by declines in our controller and access point businesses. 
Security grew 17%, along with continued strong deferred revenue growth of 31%. We had great performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 100% and 50%, respectively.
SP Video grew 18% with ongoing strength in China. Services revenue grew a very solid 11%, which includes the $200 million for the extra week I mentioned. Normalized for the extra week, the growth was 4%. 
We again saw very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8%, with product deferred revenue up 9% and service up 7%.
The portion of our product deferred revenue relating to our recurring software and subscription business grew 36%. From an orders perspective, product orders grew 3% with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. 
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets grew 4%, with the BRICS plus Mexico showing strength up 4% and China up 22% and India up 18%. Brazil and Russia continue to be challenged, and now combined representing less than 2% of our total product bookings. 
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, and Commercial grew 8%. Public Sector grew 6%, and Service Provider was flat. Similar to Q2, we are seeing pressure in the Enterprise segment, driven by the macro uncertainty.
We drove strong profitability this quarter, especially with gross margins. From a non-GAAP perspective, gross margin was 65.2%, with product gross margin of 64.5% and service gross margin of 67.1%. Operating expenses were 35.2% of revenue, and operating margin was 30%.
The total impact of the extra week on our non-GAAP cost to sales and operating expenses was $150 million. We are being very disciplined in this tough macro and pricing environment focused on making the right investments while driving operational efficiencies and productivity.
From a bottom line perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 6%, while GAAP EPS was $0.46. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 4%, while GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. 
We've been very active from an M&A perspective, closing 5 acquisitions in Q3: Jasper Technologies, making Cisco the largest cloud-based IoT service platform, helping enterprises and service providers launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale; Acano, which provides on-premise and cloud-based video infrastructure and collaboration software; Synata, which enables us to deliver search capabilities for collaboration cloud applications; Leaba, a fabless semiconductor company; and CliQr, which provides an application-defined cloud orchestration platform, which is expected to help Cisco customers simplify and accelerate their private, public and hybrid cloud deployments. 
These acquisitions are clearly focused on our key growth areas, including IoT, software, cloud and collaboration as well as continuing to strengthen our core. We've also seen solid momentum with our Ericsson partnership, closing 17 deals this quarter. 
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q3, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q3 were $63.5 billion, with $6.3 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through -- during the quarter that included $649 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 24% in Q3.
Overall, Q3 was a very solid quarter in a difficult macro environment. We focused on strong operational execution, resulting in top line growth, strong gross margins and continued operating leverage, consistent with our expectations. We're making the right investments in the growth areas of the business, balancing our decisions with sound portfolio management. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. 
The guidance for Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 0% to 3% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q4 '15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.11. 
Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck."

First, I think the #1 key takeaway is that we continue to execute well even in an obviously very tough environment. 
Secondly, we've proven our ability to transition certain elements of our portfolio, like we've done with Meraki, security and collaboration. And we believe we can accelerate long-term growth by bringing the same approach to our core, and this process has begun.
And finally, everything we do will be done through a lens of enabling our customer success while driving value for our shareholders.

And the second question with regards to the gross margins. I had to go back all the way to 2010 to find product gross margins that are equal to those that you just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to think about what is really changing in the portfolio, whether it be through mix or change in the competitive environment, anything that can justify the increase in gross margins?

So as we look at the data center business, we see a few things going on. First of all, we think that there is an impact coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw -- as our peers have, we saw some caution, in I would say, the CapEx spend in the SP space, and that was an area -- that was one of the segments that we saw weakness this quarter even with our data center portfolio. When we say data center in this context, we're talking about UCS in particular. The other thing that's going on is there is a transition going on in the data center relative to workloads. I talked a little bit about it on the last call. We see workload-specific use cases being deployed on high-performance blade, systems like our classic UCS. Then we see also this move to hyperconverged systems, which led us to the launch of our HyperFlex platform last quarter. We also see a transition to rack-based systems, which also result in stacks that are driven by container-based architectures. And so in the past quarter, 30% of our UCS business was actually from our rack portfolio, which we do have for the appropriate use cases. And you'll see us continue to expand our offering. So we have UCS as a blade system. We have a rack version of UCS. We have HyperFlex in the market. And you'll see us continue to expand our portfolio to meet the evolving use cases in the data center. I think that's what's going on the right now. Kelly, on the gross margin question?"

And normalized, if you go back to just Q1 of this year, we were at a 64.9%. And we had -- even in last year, we had a 65.1%. So I'd say, it's kind of the new normal in that 63%, 64% range. I would say, the only other thing, when you go back and you update your models for the extra week, because a lot of the top line that I talked about comes off the balance sheet, and there's no incremental cost, I did get a 0.5 point benefit just from the extra week in my gross margin. So I'd say a normalized view on the gross margin would have been closer to 64.5%."

Our Meraki business, which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud-based management and policy is over $1 billion now and growing double digits. And I think that we -- the thing I'm most excited about longer term is we see a path to deploying that model across the rest of our portfolio. And again, that work has begun. I think in the near term, we see, obviously, a mix of a pretty cautious environment still because we do see customers spending where they need to spend. But don't misunderstand, there's still a fair amount of caution in the market. But I think that we've executed well this quarter. We had 5 of our 7 product categories that were in positive growth, with 3 of those in double digits. We had all the geos in positive growth from an order perspective. And we saw pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question. Second one relative to security, the answer is yes, yes and yes. We will continue investing both organically and any other way that we see appropriate to drive that architecture. The team's done a phenomenal job."

So on the switching business, I'll point out a couple of things. Last quarter, we indicated that our campus switching business, the growth there is largely driven by refresh, which, in an uncertain times, enterprises that have infrastructure that's functioning for them, they're not going to make the move to upgrade. So we see a pause in that refresh cycle, which we talked about last quarter, and nothing really changed there. What we did see is we saw our data center switching revenue growth increase. And the other thing that I'll point out is that we had indicated that we believe that our data center switching growth would -- the new product portfolio would surpass the declines of the traditional products that we've had. And our order growth rates, which we haven't put in any of the documentation, but our order growth rate this past quarter, on that $4 billion portfolio, was double digits. So we're pleased with the progress that we made in the data center switching space. And again, that's $4 billion, and it grew double digits in orders. So we feel okay about that. On the routing front, I think it's a combination of things. I think that there's certainly $1 billion in the quarter. $1 billion in the quarter, $4 billion annualized run rate on the data center switching. Kelly's making sure we're clear. On the routing business, we've seen a few things. Clearly, there's a macro issue that we're dealing with. We also saw, again, as you heard from some of our peers, we saw some increased caution in the Service Provider space. We saw a slow movement in the core of those networks, kind of flattish activity at the edge. And we do have a number of new platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that we, at some point, in the coming quarters, we would expect those to begin to show up favorably.

And we're seeing that pay dividends with the acceleration of growth. Again, if you normalize our service revenue growth this quarter for the extra week, they still grew 4%, which is up from 3% year-over-year growth in Q2 and it was 1% in Q1.

When we guide, we tend to have a little conservatism in the gross margin rate. But take out that 0.5 point, we're still parked at the 64.5% range. We do have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out. So always, Q1 and Q3 are strongest gross margin quarters. And Q2 and Q4 are weaker, and it's typically driven by our mix, especially mix of servers in those 2 quarters. So that's also a driver. And I think just operationally speaking, again, the teams are doing a very good job from a productivity perspective in terms of driving costs out of the product. We have a lot of efficiencies out of the supply chain in terms of managing our freight and our inventory management. So I'd say, there's just been real -- we had a very strong quarter from operational excellence. If I look at pricing this quarter, we are being very disciplined on pricing. We're starting to see a tiny bit of a tick-up, and you'll see that in our Q, where the impact to our gross margin rate, year-to-date, is about 2.2 points and Q3 was 2.4.

Let me, first of all, say that, I think, over the last few quarters, Joe Cozzolino and his team have been incredibly focused on driving the operational excellence around the P&L element of that, which is what you're seeing with the gross margins and I think some of the discussion I had earlier around the focus on the renewal capability. I think we're seeing general improvement in the execution there. We see Advanced Services obviously doing reasonably well, security services doing reasonably well. And then as I mentioned earlier, the renewal activity, our team's did a better job this past quarter. So I think a lot of what you've seen is operational discipline and execution, to be honest. However, I think that there is an opportunity, and more of our customers are asking us to help them, as they look at their strategies, to take advantage of this digital transition that's occurring.

So I'll let Kelly tackle the second question. If you look at what we declared when we stated our strategies around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe is going to be long-term desire of our customers, which is to operate in a hybrid cloud model. And we said that we're going to do 3 primary things. We're going to make sure that we provide the infrastructure to the cloud providers, and we've done that with SPs, and we've done that obviously with the top 10 web scale providers, given the business was up 31%. We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud-delivered and as-a-service delivered, where it makes sense, and over time across the entire portfolio. And you've seen us do that with our continued growth in Meraki, in collaboration and security. And now the plans -- we're actually underway on a project to deploy that across the rest of our portfolio, although it's early days. But I think when you look at that deferred revenue of 36% on the balance sheet, that says that we were being successful in the second pillar. And then the third pillar was to help our customers with the infrastructure needed to actually take advantage of both private and public clouds or enabling hybrid. And when you look at the data center switching portfolio, on an annualized $4 billion business with new orders growing in double digits, I think that customers are driving both. And I think that the 3 pillars of that strategy are working. As far as gross margins, when we sell to private cloud versus public cloud providers, Kelly, any comment there?"

And so coming into that earnings call, we had seen a very tough close to the quarter from an orders perspective. We saw our Enterprise customers in particular really put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire. And I think that led us to a very cautious tone. And so that would be the #1 reason why we were more cautious then. I just want to -- I want to make sure that we are balanced here, that while we're optimistic and we're pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively uncertain environment. We got the Brexit coming up, the vote coming up in June. We got the news out of the Fed today. We've got all the election dynamics. We got issues in Brazil. We've got geopolitical dynamics. So there's still a relatively broad set of unknown issues out there.

And I think this is sort of in the same vein of -- it's all about cloud. It's like -- or all about SDN or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a technology trend. There are underlying business drivers that are leading them to these solutions. And so what we've been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes about. So in the case of the web scale players, what they're looking at is they're looking for significant automation. They're looking for the ability to run massive data centers at very -- at huge scale, very low cost with a ton of automation, which, over time, will become the norm, I think, for all customers. There's this massive focus on operational expense reduction, which is all around automation, programmability, which is where we're headed with our core platforms in the Enterprise as well. So what we did is we built some really aggressive products. Our teams, again, the ASICs improvement that have been built that give us the advantage on the price performance and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the operational environments of these customers, I think, has been the key. And that's what they're looking for. They're not singularly focused on white box. They are looking at how do they solve that problem. And we're just spending more time with them to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements, and you're going to see us continue to evolve our portfolio in whatever way we need to, to make sure that we remain relevant there."

And I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now in the midst of the uncertainty that's being discussed in the marketplace. On the Inspur partnership, in September, we signed the MoU, which was basically a letter of intent to formulate the venture. And I was over 3 weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically, and we're in the final stages of getting that one put together. I would expect that we'll be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think sort of late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that. I think on the Ericsson front, anytime you do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably than we would all hope, but we're very optimistic. We spent a ton of time together. I think on the last call, we talked about a number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at Mobile World Congress, which was pretty amazing.

It is a challenging environment out there, and I think that our teams have proven that we continue to execute regardless of the environment we face. 
As I said last call, we're running the company on 2 fronts. We're focused on the execution and the operational excellence, and at the same time, we're focus on transitioning our business and investing in the future, which I think was displayed by our progress in the different areas that I highlighted during the call today. I think that, again, if you look at our success in security and collaboration next-gen data center, the Meraki cloud networking platform and, overall, in our transition to software and subscription, I think we're on that journey. We've proven that we can transition elements of our portfolio, and we're going to apply that same approach again to the rest of our business. We're in the early days in the front end of a long journey, but I'm pleased with where we are.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2016. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backhaul information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our [indiscernible] when this impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.

We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter, wrapping up a great year.

We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter, wrapping up a great year. We closed on our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS, which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well, and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability.
Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After 3 consecutive quarters of growth, both Service Provider and emerging markets turned negative. Service Provider orders declined 5%, reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers. In addition, emerging markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment. 
We had strong performance in security, data center switching, collaboration and services as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas where we continue to see momentum. 
First, security. Security is the #1 priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading-edge innovation as we lead the transition to cloud-delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers. For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A, to meet our customers' most pressing needs such as: cloud defense orchestrator, which provides cloud-based security policy management; stealth watch learning networks, which leverages the network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise. We've also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as-a-service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success in rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our app solution now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next-generation firewall market. We launched our full-featured, next-generation firewall in March, and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter. 
Second, next-generation data center. Over the past year, we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open, programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way. We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco cloud center, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads real-time between hybrid and private clouds while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4, growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate. In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyperconverged solution, and we already have approximately 500 customers. And over 1/4 of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback. 
Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio, delivered both on-premise and from the cloud, enabled us in FY '16 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth, with revenue growing 6% and deferred revenue growing at 13%.
Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software and subscription-based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration, and overall, our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong, and we'll continue to accelerate this transition.
Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today, we announced a restructuring enabling us to optimize our cost base in lower growth areas of our portfolio and further invest in key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses and will continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenu",1097,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. 
First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenues 3% and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and the full year, we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $48.7 billion, with product up 2% and services up 5%. 
Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2%, driven by strength in data center switching, with continued momentum in ACI and the next-generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in Service Provider. Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio, which grew in the double digits, and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%. Our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early uptake by our customers, led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5%, led by growth in cloud-based Meraki, partially offset by a decline in controllers. Security grew 16%, with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50%, respectively. SP Video declined 12%, driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5%, driven by our focus on renewals and attach. But we continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 8%, with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring southern subscription businesses grew 33%. 
From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1%, with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%. Total Emerging Markets declined 6%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%. In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in Enterprise of 3% as well as a solid performance in Commercial of 5%. Public Sector grew 1%, and Service Provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%. 
We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points, and service gross margin of 67.0%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points.
We also saw good momentum in improvement in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%, an increase of 50 basis points, with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margins, up 0.3 points and 1.4 points, respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.0%, up 1.4 points. We remain disciplined and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity. 
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, up 9%, GAAP EPS with $0.56 [ph]. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36, up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock, which has since closed early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our Security Everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud, to the network, to the endpoint and also aligned to our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services. We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas, including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT, and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy. 
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q4, we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well despite the volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution, driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions and key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long term and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value. 
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 fiscal year '16. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5,500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of fiscal '17 and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year '17, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year. 
I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call."

A little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. Commercial was up 5. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in commercial. And then Public Sector was up 1%, and I believe all except, perhaps, Europe were positive as well in public sector.

It's part of what we're driving with our shift to software. Those businesses have great margins, and it's part of the overall transition. In terms of when do we change our model or guidance, I think that will come over time as we make bigger shifts at the company level, but that is our goal as we shift to more software that have those nice, great margins."

The orchestration capability that we talked about with cloud Center, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration.

So when I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you've got the SP traditional portfolio with Edge access and core, which we've discussed earlier, which is largely just a consumption-driven cycle that we go through. In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software-defined networking, which we're very well positioned in right now with our portfolio. And we're actually working on a key differentiator for us, which, I think, is as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next-generation, secure Edge with our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions with the ability to have robust cloud security and Edge security is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space. And then finally, when we talk about the security and the security-driven refresh of our core, in Q4, we actually had a couple of customers -- I talked earlier in the opening comments about stealth watch learning networks, which is effectively a machine learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch. And it actually does machine learning and a little bit of AI to determine normalcy for customers and then flag for them when they see abnormal behavior going on. And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. So we believe that there's innovation that we can bring that will lead us to [indiscernible] in the quarter, and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we're seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out, but we're seeing some early examples there. All right, Marilyn? Thank you very much. 
In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we are committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities regardless of the conditions of the market. And we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we made to our customers, partners and shareholders. We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models, and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also -- I believe we'll drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we are very committed to driving innovation. And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders, while ensuring that we're also making the decisions to -- for Cisco's long-term success, will remain at the forefront. So I want to thank everyone for spending time with us today, and we look forward to talking to all of you soon. Marilyn?"

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2016. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our [Audio Gap] when this impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck."

We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter wrapping up a great year. We closed on our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAA",906,"Thank you, Marilyn. We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter wrapping up a great year. We closed on our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS, which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well, and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability.
Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After 3 consecutive quarters of growth, both Service Provider and emerging markets turned negative. Service Provider orders declined 5%, reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers. In addition, emerging markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment.
We had strong performance in security, data center switching, collaboration and services as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas where we continue to see momentum.
First, security. Security is the #1 priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading-edge innovation as we lead the transition to cloud-delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers. For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A, to meet our customers' most pressing needs such as: cloud defense orchestrator, which provides cloud-based security policy management; stealth watch learning networks, which leverages the network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise. We have also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as-a-service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success in rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our AMP solution now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next-generation firewall market. We launched our full-featured next-generation firewall in March, and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter.
Second, next-generation data center. Over the past year, we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open, programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way. We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco CloudCenter, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads real-time between hybrid and private clouds while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4, growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate. In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyperconverged solution, and we already have approximately 500 customers. And over 1/4 of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback.
Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio, delivered both on-premise and from the cloud, enabled us in FY '16 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth, with revenue growing 6% and deferred revenue growing at 13%.
Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software and subscription-based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration, and overall, our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong, and we'll continue to accelerate this transition.
Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today, we announced a restructuring, enabling us to optimize our cost base in lower growth areas of our portfolio and further invest in key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses, and we'll continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue",1097,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenues 3% and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and the full year, we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $48.7 billion, with product up 2% and services up 5%.
Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2%, driven by strength in data center switching, with continued momentum in ACI and the next-generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in Service Provider. Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio, which grew in the double digits, and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%. Our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early uptake by our customers, led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5%, led by growth in cloud-based Meraki, partially offset by a decline in controllers. Security grew 16%, with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50%, respectively. SP Video declined 12%, driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5%, driven by our focus on renewals and attach. Though we continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue, total deferred revenue grew 8%, with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33%.
From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1%, with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 6%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%. In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in Enterprise of 3% as well as a solid performance in Commercial of 5%. Public Sector grew 1%, and Service Provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%.
We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points, with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points, and service gross margin of 67.0%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points.
We also saw good momentum in improvement in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%, an increase of 50 basis points, with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margins, up 0.3 points and 1.4 points, respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.0%, up 1.4 points. We remain disciplined and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.56. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36, up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock, which has since closed early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our Security Everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud, to the network, to the endpoint and also aligned with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services. We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas, including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT, and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy.
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q4, we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well despite a volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution, driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions in key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long term and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value.
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 fiscal year '16. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5,500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of fiscal '17 and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year '17, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.
I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call."

A little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. Commercial was up 5. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in commercial. And then in Public Sector, it was up 1%, and I believe all, except perhaps Europe, were positive as well in Public Sector.

We're generally beginning orderability, I think, some time around now. It is a combination of premise-based hardware with subscription software. And so we're just very much in the early days. We have taken a couple of orders from customers. I will tell you that the general feedback from our customers is that it solves a problem that they've had for a very long time that nothing else has solved.

As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next-generation data center buildout in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%. So we feel like customers continue to move towards a hybrid cloud environment. The orchestration capability that we talked about with cloud center, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration.

So when I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you've got the SP traditional portfolio with Edge access and core, which we've discussed earlier, which is largely just a consumption-driven cycle that we go through. In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software-defined wide area networking, which we're very well positioned in right now with our IWAN portfolio. And we're actually working on a key differentiator for us, which, I think, is as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next-generation secure Edge with our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions with the ability to have robust cloud security and Edge security is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space. And then finally, when we talk about the security and the security-driven refresh of our core, in Q4, we actually had a couple of customers -- I talked earlier in the opening comments about StealthWatch Learning Networks, which is effectively a machine learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch. And it actually does machine learning and a little bit of AI to determine normalcy for customers and then flag for them when they see abnormal behavior going on. And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. So we believe that there's innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we're seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out, but we're seeing some early examples there. All right, Marilyn, thank you very much.
In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we are committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities regardless of the conditions of the market. And we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we've made to our customers, partners and shareholders. We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models, and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also -- I believe we'll drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we're very committed to driving innovation. And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders while ensuring that we're also making the decisions to -- for Cisco's long-term success, will remain at the forefront.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2016. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our [Audio Gap] impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck."

We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter wrapping up a great year. We closed out our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS, which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well, and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability.
Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After 3 consecutive quarters of growth, both Service Provider and emerging markets turned negative. Service Provider orders declined 5%, reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers. In addition, emerging markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment.
We had strong performance in security, data center switching, collaboration and services as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas where we continue to see momentum.
First, security. Security is the #1 priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading-edge innovation as we lead the transition to cloud-delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers. For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A, to meet our customers' most pressing needs such as: cloud defense orchestrator, which provides cloud-based security policy management; StealthWatch Learning Networks, which leverages the network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise. We have also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as-a-service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success in rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our AMP solution now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next-generation firewall market. We launched our full-featured next-generation firewall in March, and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter.
Second, next-generation data center. Over the past year, we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open, programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way. We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco CloudCenter, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads, real-time, between hybrid and private clouds while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4; growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate. In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyperconverged solution, and we already have approximately 500 customers. And over 1/4 of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback.
Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio, delivered both on-premise and from the cloud, enabled us in FY '16 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth, with revenue growing 6% and deferred revenue growing at 13%.
Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software and subscription-based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration, and overall, our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong, and we'll continue to accelerate this transition.
Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today, we announced a restructuring, enabling us to optimize our cost base in lower growth areas of our portfolio and further invest in key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses, and we'll continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue",1097,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenues 3% and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and the full year, we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $48.7 billion, with product up 2% and services up 5%.
Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2%, driven by strength in data center switching, with continued momentum in ACI and the next-generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in Service Provider. Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio, which grew in the double digits, and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%. Our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early uptake by our customers, led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5%, led by growth in cloud-based Meraki, partially offset by a decline in controllers. Security grew 16%, with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50%, respectively. SP Video declined 12%, driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5%, driven by our focus on renewals and attach. So, we continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue; total deferred revenue grew 8%, with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33%.
From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1%, with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 6%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%. In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in Enterprise of 3% as well as a solid performance in Commercial of 5%. Public Sector grew 1%, and Service Provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%.
We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points, with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points, and service gross margin of 67.0%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points.
We also saw good momentum in improvements in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%; an increase of 50 basis points, with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margins; up 0.3 points and 1.4 points, respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.0%; up 1.4 points. We remain disciplined and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63; up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.56. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36; up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock; which has since closed early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our Security Everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud, to the network, to the endpoint and also aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services. We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas, including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT, and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy.
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q4, we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well despite a volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution, driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions in key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long term and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value.
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 fiscal year '16. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5,500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of fiscal '17 and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year '17, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.
I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call."

A little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. Commercial was up 5%.

We're generally beginning order-ability, I think, sometime around now. It is a combination of premise-based hardware with subscription software. And so we're just very much in the early days. We have taken a couple of orders from customers. I will tell you that the general feedback from our customers is that it solves a problem that they've had for a very long time that nothing else has solved.

We restructured and drove new value in how we put together certain Cisco ONE software packages for our customers. And in Q4, as an example, there was about $139 million that would have been recognized as revenue, that because of the way we have now structured those offers and the value that customers see in those, those are going to transition to ratable revenue recognition.

As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next-generation data center buildout in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%. So we feel like customers continue to move towards a hybrid cloud environment. The orchestration capability that we talked about with CloudCenter, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration; so think about Tetration providing analytics about what's going on; CliQr and ACI then being able to deploy policy and move workloads between public and private cloud, and that's what we think customers are going to look for.

So when I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you've got the SP traditional portfolio with Edge access and core, which we've discussed earlier, which is largely just a consumption-driven cycle that we go through. In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software-defined wide area networking, which we're very well positioned in right now with our IWAN portfolio. And we're actually working on a key differentiator for us, which, I think, is as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next-generation secure Edge with our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions with the ability to have robust cloud security and Edge security is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space. And then finally, when we talk about the security and the security-driven refresh of our core, in Q4, we actually had a couple of customers -- I talked earlier in the opening comments about StealthWatch Learning Networks, which is effectively a machine learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch. And it actually does machine learning and a little bit of AI to determine normalcy for customers and then flag for them when they see abnormal behavior going on. And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. So we believe that there's innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we're seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out, but we're seeing some early examples there. All right, Marilyn, thank you very much.
In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we are committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities regardless of the conditions of the market. And we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we've made to our customers, partners and shareholders. We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models, and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also -- I believe we'll drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we're very committed to driving innovation. And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders while ensuring that we're also making the decisions to -- for Cisco's long-term success, will remain at the forefront.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2016. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our [Audio Gap] impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck."

We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter wrapping up a great year. We closed out our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS, which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well, and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability.
Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After 3 consecutive quarters of growth, both Service Provider and emerging markets turned negative. Service Provider orders declined 5%, reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers. In addition, emerging markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment.
We had strong performance in security, data center switching, collaboration and services as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas where we continue to see momentum.
First, security. Security is the #1 priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading-edge innovation as we lead the transition to cloud-delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers. For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A, to meet our customers' most pressing needs such as: cloud defense orchestrator, which provides cloud-based security policy management; StealthWatch Learning Networks, which leverages the network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise. We have also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as-a-service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success in rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our AMP solution now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next-generation firewall market. We launched our full-featured next-generation firewall in March, and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter.
Second, next-generation data center. Over the past year, we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open, programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way. We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco CloudCenter, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads, real-time, between hybrid and private clouds while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4; growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate. In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyperconverged solution, and we already have approximately 500 customers. And over 1/4 of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback.
Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio, delivered both on-premise and from the cloud, enabled us in FY '16 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth, with revenue growing 6% and deferred revenue growing at 13%.
Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software and subscription-based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration, and overall, our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong, and we'll continue to accelerate this transition.
Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today, we announced a restructuring, enabling us to optimize our cost base in lower growth areas of our portfolio and further invest in key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses, and we'll continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials."

We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue",1097,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenues 3% and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and the full year, we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $48.7 billion, with product up 2% and services up 5%.
Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2%, driven by strength in data center switching, with continued momentum in ACI and the next-generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in Service Provider. Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio, which grew in the double digits, and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%. Our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early uptake by our customers, led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5%, led by growth in cloud-based Meraki, partially offset by a decline in controllers. Security grew 16%, with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50%, respectively. SP Video declined 12%, driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5%, driven by our focus on renewals and attach. So, we continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue; total deferred revenue grew 8%, with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33%.
From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1%, with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 6%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%. In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in Enterprise of 3% as well as a solid performance in Commercial of 5%. Public Sector grew 1%, and Service Provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%.
We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points, with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points, and service gross margin of 67.0%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points.
We also saw good momentum in improvements in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%; an increase of 50 basis points, with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margins; up 0.3 points and 1.4 points, respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.0%; up 1.4 points. We remain disciplined and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63; up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.56. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36; up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock; which has since closed early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our Security Everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud, to the network, to the endpoint and also aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services. We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas, including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT, and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy.
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q4, we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.
To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well despite a volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution, driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions in key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long term and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value.
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 fiscal year '16. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5,500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of fiscal '17 and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year '17, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.
I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call."

A little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. Commercial was up 5%. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in Commercial. And then in Public Sector, it was up 1%, and I believe all, except perhaps Europe, were positive as well in Public Sector.

We're generally beginning order-ability, I think, sometime around now. It is a combination of premise-based hardware with subscription software. And so we're just very much in the early days. We have taken a couple of orders from customers. I will tell you that the general feedback from our customers is that it solves a problem that they've had for a very long time that nothing else has solved.

And the other issue is that there is some impact from the transition in our business model. I'll give you a quick example. We restructured and drove new value in how we put together certain Cisco ONE software packages for our customers. And in Q4, as an example, there was about $139 million that would have been recognized as revenue, that because of the way we have now structured those offers and the value that customers see in those, those are going to transition to ratable revenue recognition. So there is a slight impact from that as we look forward as well, and those are the key things that led us to our guide."

I saw one report that discussed double-digit declines outside the United States and maybe flat to slightly up inside the U.S., which is effectively what we saw from a demand perspective. So it was very much in line with that. As far as what we see going forward, look, we certainly don't expect that these networks over time, that the traffic will decline.

So we see that continuing. As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next-generation data center buildout in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%. So we feel like customers continue to move towards a hybrid cloud environment. The orchestration capability that we talked about with CloudCenter, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration; so think about Tetration providing analytics about what's going on; CliQr and ACI then being able to deploy policy and move workloads between public and private cloud, and that's what we think customers are going to look for.

So when I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you've got the SP traditional portfolio with Edge access and core, which we've discussed earlier, which is largely just a consumption-driven cycle that we go through. In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software-defined wide area networking, which we're very well positioned in right now with our IWAN portfolio. And we're actually working on a key differentiator for us, which, I think, is as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next-generation secure Edge with our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions with the ability to have robust cloud security and Edge security is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space. And then finally, when we talk about the security and the security-driven refresh of our core, in Q4, we actually had a couple of customers -- I talked earlier in the opening comments about StealthWatch Learning Networks, which is effectively a machine learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch. And it actually does machine learning and a little bit of AI to determine normalcy for customers and then flag for them when they see abnormal behavior going on. And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. So we believe that there's innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we're seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out, but we're seeing some early examples there. All right, Marilyn, thank you very much.
In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we are committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities regardless of the conditions of the market. And we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we've made to our customers, partners and shareholders. We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models, and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also -- I believe we'll drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we're very committed to driving innovation. And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders while ensuring that we're also making the decisions to -- for Cisco's long-term success, will remain at the forefront.

They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
As a reminder, in Q2 fiscal 2016, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2017. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck."

So we delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging. We executed very well in the quarter with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3%, along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins.
This quarter, total product orders declined 2%, largely due to Service Provider orders declining 12%, which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter. We continue to show great progress in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change, including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time, we're delivering more innovation with simple, intelligent, automated solutions with industry leading security across our portfolio.
Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum. First, Security. Our Security revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based recurring business resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%. Our competitive position in Security is growing stronger as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we're the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I'm incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago, establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers.
This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions with AMP revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally. We also see ongoing traction with our next-generation firewall, revenue growing over 35%, as we added 5,300 customers in Q1, bringing our total next-gen firewall customer base to approximately 62,000.
Going forward, we're driving innovation as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over 2 weeks ago at our Partner Summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for endpoints, a SaaS-based cloud-managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and effective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture.
Second, our next-generation data center. Our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We are investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership. To do this, we are delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers' widespread adoption of Cisco's ACI family of data center networking products continued in Q1 with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion. The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move workloads in and out of public cloud environments while maintaining enterprise security and policy.
We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through Tetration, agnostic cloud management with cloud center from our CliQr acquisition and our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. This will give our customers flexibility, agility and savings by delivering the benefits of both private and public clouds. We have a unique set of capabilities to lead in this market and address our customers' needs for delivering business applications quickly, cost effectively and at scale.
In Collaboration, we are adding new capabilities to our collaboration and IoT offerings through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. As a global market leader, Cisco's Collaboration business has a solid foundation to drive our road map of products and services that will increasingly be delivered from the cloud such as Spark, our end-to-end business collaboration suite.
Over the last few months, we've added 2 significant partners to our collaboration ecosystem. We announced a global strategic alliance with Salesforce to natively integrate Cisco's cloud collaboration platform with Salesforce's Lightning platform. This will deliver expanded reach and relevance as part of our cloud strategy.
We also formed an alliance with IBM to further enhance the collaboration experience for our customers by combining our collaboration and analytics technologies. We are integrating our Cisco Spark and WebEx offerings with IBM's cloud collaboration solutions along with cognitive computing capabilities enabled by the IBM Watson platform.
While the dynamics in Service Provider and emerging markets continue to present headwinds to overall growth, I'm pleased with our success in accelerating our momentum in our key investment areas and our commitment to operational discipline. Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q1 results and outlook in more detail."

We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up",799,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up 3%. We expanded our profitability year-over-year with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin.
Let me provide some details on revenue. Total product revenue was down 1%. We saw Switching decline 7% driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33% as Chuck mentioned. In campus, we still see a pause in enterprise spend largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment. Routing grew 6%, driven by growth in both SP core and edge.
Collaboration was down 3%, although we did have solid order growth. The revenue decrease was driven by TelePresence and Unified Communications endpoints, partially offset by strong growth of 10% in conferencing as we see more customers each quarter committing to WebEx. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue up 14%.
Data Center declined 3%, impacted by the market shift we've seen from blade to rack. While not significant in terms of revenue at this point, we did see our new hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, have solid early uptake by our customers.
Wireless declined 2%, led by a decline in controllers and soft E-rate funding, partially offset by strong growth in Meraki with our cloud-managed product line.
Security grew 11% with deferred revenue growth of 39% as we transition to more software and recurring revenue. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security, up 100% as well as web security solutions, which was up 60%.
Services grew 7% with our ongoing focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we're making progress each quarter on our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 12% with product up 19% and services up 8%. The portion of our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% to $3.8 billion. From an orders perspective, total product orders declined 2% with book to bill below 1.
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was down 4%. EMEA grew 1%, and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 2%.
In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 5%. Commercial grew 1%. Public sector was flat, and Service Provider declined 12%.
We are driving consistent profitability. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 65.2%, growing 0.3 points with product gross margin of 64.8%, up 0.3 points and service gross margin flat at 66.2%.
We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.6%, improving 0.2 points. We remain disciplined and focused on increasing operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61, up 3%. GAAP EPS was $0.46.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. We completed 3 acquisitions in Q1, increasing our investments in key priority in growth areas, including CloudLock, which specializes in cloud access security broker technology, which is part of our Security business; ContainerX that develops Enterprise class container management technology; and Worklife, which develops leading software that is complementary to our collaboration business. 
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $71 billion, with $10.4 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. 
To summarize, we executed well in Q1, delivering strong profitability growth. We hope to make solid progress in our transition to more software and subscription-based models. We're committed to making the key strategic moves and disciplined investments to drive long-term financial performance and deliver shareholder value. 
So now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q2 of fiscal year '16. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.
So I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

I'm very pleased with the success of the investments we've made in priority growth areas such as Security, Collaboration and our ACI platform. These areas are key building blocks, along with our strong franchise in Switching and Routing that place Cisco in a unique position with our customers as they become increasingly digital.
As you've seen with our Meraki platform, we have achieved rapid adoption of cloud-managed networking with enterprise, security and policy delivered as-a-service. Over the next several years, we will bring this automation, management and security at scale to the balance of our Switching and Routing portfolio as we continue to offer new consumption models aligned to our customers' needs. While this is no small task, it's an incredible opportunity for Cisco as we bring the successful model to the largest part of our business. 
As we make these investments, we also remain firmly committed to our operational discipline and driving long-term value for our customers and shareholders, and I'm very optimistic about our future. 
Marilyn, now I'll turn it back over to you for questions."

I mean, the Switching results are very disappointing. Clearly, the wireless is now declining. Data center, and I've been asking you about data center of 3 quarters in a row, and it's still not delivering. And you had some changes in leadership over there as well, but it's just still not where it needs to be. I guess, I'm trying to gauge how much of the challenges that you have seen here right now, in your opinion, are macro-driven versus, perhaps, portfolio-driven. Because it seems like a lot of competitors in some of these areas that actually are doing very well. In Switching for example, in Aruba and wireless, HP and then the data center is doing well. [indiscernible] is clearly doing well. These are key major areas for you, and we're seeing revenue declines. So help us understand kind of a little bit what's going on under the surface here. And what is it that makes you feel comfortable that there is no big problem for you? On the flip side, is there anything on the portfolio side that you think could kind of turn the tide here?"

So let me hit a few of those areas, and let me first just acknowledge that there are always areas that we can execute more effectively. So we are -- we're working right now, the teams have been working over the last year on innovation in many of the areas that you mentioned. And again, I'm optimistic about the pipeline of innovation that we have right now. I think when you look at the Switching portfolio, for us, back in January, when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise, campus refresh, it's just basically maintained. It stayed the same way throughout the year. So I'm pretty comfortable with our position there. And as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud-based management to the rest of the portfolio, I think that, that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh. For me, it's really about, as we look at the key driver refresh over the longer term and the campus, I think it's going to be really around automation, which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network. In a couple of the other areas you mention, I think, in UCS, there's been a fundamental shift in the data center to, again, we talked about the rack technology. And then hyperconverged, we have some early success with HyperFlex, and we have some new capabilities that'll be coming out after the first of the calendar year that, I think, will help us in that space. And on the wireless front, I think, there are really -- I think there are 2 key drivers there. First of all is we're -- the market is transition to a controller-less architecture. So in large part, our access points were actually positive, but the controller side of that business was down. Meraki was positive. And then also, we're a pretty substantial recipient of the E-Rate business. So as that has moved out much more slowly than expected, I think that, that has also impacted that business. So hopefully that gives you some color around those areas."

You can assume that we have done an account by account by account analysis in that space and understand what is going on there. Right now, I think there are unique set of characteristics, particularly in the SP space. You have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which, I think, has led to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by the analysts, as well as you have the political and regulatory environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the U.S. and around the world. Some of those could turn more favorable. Some of those could remain negative. We're just not going to model any improvement there. And that's the real reason for the guide, just to be clear on that. Postelection, I think that most CEOs that I talk to, we are pragmatic about the result. And now we are all focused on the policy issues that matter to each of our companies.

For example, just using Cisco ONE as an example in this quarter, it would have been 1.5 points just on that if we had recognized it perpetually like we had a year ago. So it's, for sure, about at least 2 points, and clearly, that continues to grow and accelerate. So you can assume we're assuming that in my guidance.

Obviously, it's been pointed out that it's developing pretty well. But I'm wondering 2 things. First, the pace of acquisitions and, specifically, what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions seem to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. So I'm just wondering if you're feeling like you've got the portfolio and the technology where you need it. Or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high that, perhaps, those will reaccelerate? And then my second question is on Security. And I think, Kelly, you kind of alluded to this, but at what point do we start to see incremental benefit on some of the other businesses from security footprint? It seems like a lot of it probably of security can be tied to new hardware and switching and networking, et cetera. So should we expect to see some incremental pull-through or benefit to the more traditional hardware business? And if so, when should we expect that?"

So as it relates to the first part of your question, on the acquisition capabilities, I think what you'll find with this team is that there is a ton of internal innovation that's occurring. We, again, at the Partner Summit launched [indiscernible] endpoints, which is to bring the endpoints into the consolidated architecture. You can assume that we are actively continuing to scan the landscape relative to acquisitions that fit within the architecture, that bring new capabilities. I think that when I took the role, I would probably suggest that there was a little bit of a pent-up demand around some companies that the teams wanted to move on, and we moved relatively quickly in the first year or so. But I wouldn't assume that, that suggests that there's no more activity that we will see there. I think we will. As it relates to the core networking platforms and at what point we'll see security pulling through, I think we have had some examples over the last few years where we've seen, particularly security portfolios integrated into routing platforms as the teams have done that we have seen, as we sell those, as licenses that run on top of routers, assuming the routers have the right horsepower, they're fine. If they don't, then they'll drive a refresh. There are some capabilities the teams are working on that actually provide security at the packet level inside the network. And our intent over the next several quarters is to bring some of that technology to market and give our customers greater visibility and give them another yet another source of contributing to the landscape out of the network itself. So we'll have to wait and see how successful we are, but that's our plan."

And then there are some providers around the world, not necessarily in the U.S. even, that have -- that are dealing with political dynamics and potential regulatory issues that just aren't clear. And so I think it's a little bit of all of that. And my assessment of when those issues are resolved is dependent upon the issues themselves. And we're going to have to wait and see how they play out. I wouldn't -- I don't -- I have not heard a lot of, say, U.S.-based service providers who have paused directly related to the election.

So the recurring revenue number, I think, is what you're talking about, which is a combination of our product recurring revenue from the software and SaaS businesses, plus the recurring revenue from services. So this quarter, that was 29%, and we continue to make progress off product. That has grown to be 9%, up from 6% and of our rep product revenue in Q1 '16. So we continue to make progress there, so that's up to [ph] 29% versus it was 28% in Q4 and 25.5% in Q1. So making the progress there. On the pricing question, Paul, we're definitely in the same ranges that we normally have been. It's actually year-over-year slightly better than we were last quarter, which is largely driven by the mix of what we saw. So I'd say it's in normal ranges, but how we're driving that internally is, of course, we're very disciplined around pricing like we've talked about. But we empower our sales leaders and country leaders to -- we measure them on 3 things. We measure them on revenue them, we measure them on operating margin growth and we measure them on driving market share. And they're empowered to make trade-offs between those, and if they need to give more price to win in the franchises they want to win,  them, they will do that. So the good news is they're, again, continuing to be very disciplined making those trade-offs, and the pricing is staying in the normal ranges."

I think that, that level of simplicity and those capabilities will improve. I think what we see is best represented by our ACI portfolio. When you look at our customers who are building out modern data center infrastructure, I think those are representative of the customers who believe that they're going to have a hybrid environment. And that piece of business grew 33%. It's up to $3 billion run rate. So I think your observations are probably valid, particularly if you look at a lot of the OpenStack, early OpenStack implementations.

So incentives haven't changed at all this year. I think it's just the sales teams are incredibly disciplined around it. And I'd say, the whole company understands the trade-off of that, right? I mean, we are all focused on making the trade-off so we can optimize and drive as much growth as we possibly can and go after every point of market share that we can.

I'd say only the other thing to think about is, the acquisitions that we have been doing that have been largely software-related, whether it's in security or cloud, those are -- those SaaS businesses certainly have very high margins that just help add to the mix.

I'd say, on the data center side, you understand the dynamic there, right? For the -- to your point, we launched a fantastic product a couple of years ago, but we had to manage through the transition of a very sizable legacy business, data center portfolio declining as that accelerated. And so we managed through that. And again, that business has continued to grow as we grow through that intersection and cross through now as legacy piece we've worked largely through.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
As is customary, in Q1, we made certain reclassifications to our prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
As a reminder, in Q2 fiscal 2016, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2017. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck."

So we delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging. We executed very well in the quarter with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3%, along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins.
This quarter, total product orders declined 2%, largely due to Service Provider orders declining 12%, which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter. We continue to show great progress in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change, including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time, we're delivering more innovation with simple, intelligent, automated solutions with industry leading security across our portfolio.
Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum. First, Security. Our Security revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based recurring business resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%. Our competitive position in Security is growing stronger as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we're the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I'm incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago, establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers.
This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions with AMP revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally. We also see ongoing traction with our next-generation firewall, revenue growing over 35%, as we added 5,300 customers in Q1, bringing our total next-gen firewall customer base to approximately 62,000.
Going forward, we're driving innovation as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over 2 weeks ago at our Partner Summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for Endpoints, a SaaS-based cloud-managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and effective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture.
Second, our next-generation data center. Our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We are investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership. To do this, we are delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers' widespread adoption of Cisco's ACI family of data center networking products continued in Q1 with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion. The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move workloads in and out of public cloud environments while maintaining enterprise security and policy.
We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through Tetration, agnostic cloud management with cloud center from our CliQr acquisition and our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. This will give our customers flexibility, agility and savings by delivering the benefits of both private and public clouds. We have a unique set of capabilities to lead in this market and address our customers' needs for delivering business applications quickly, cost effectively and at scale.
In Collaboration, we are adding new capabilities to our collaboration and IoT offerings through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. As a global market leader, Cisco's Collaboration business has a solid foundation to drive our road map of products and services that will increasingly be delivered from the cloud such as Spark, our end-to-end business collaboration suite.
Over the last few months, we've added 2 significant partners to our collaboration ecosystem. We announced a global strategic alliance with Salesforce to natively integrate Cisco's cloud collaboration platform with Salesforce's Lightning platform. This will deliver expanded reach and relevance as part of our cloud strategy.
We also formed an alliance with IBM to further enhance the collaboration experience for our customers by combining our collaboration and analytics technologies. We are integrating our Cisco Spark and WebEx offerings with IBM's cloud collaboration solutions along with cognitive computing capabilities enabled by the IBM Watson platform.
While the dynamics in Service Provider and emerging markets continue to present headwinds to overall growth, I'm pleased with our success in accelerating our momentum in our key investment areas and our commitment to operational discipline. Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q1 results and outlook in more detail."

We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up",797,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up 3%. We expanded our profitability year-over-year with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin.
Let me provide some details on revenue. Total product revenue was down 1%. We saw Switching decline 7% driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33% as Chuck mentioned. In campus, we still see a pause in enterprise spend largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment. Routing grew 6%, driven by growth in both SP core and edge.
Collaboration was down 3%, although we did have solid order growth. The revenue decrease was driven by TelePresence and Unified Communications endpoints, partially offset by strong growth of 10% in conferencing as we see more customers each quarter committing to WebEx. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue up 14%.
Data Center declined 3%, impacted by the market shift we've seen from blade to rack. While not significant in terms of revenue at this point, we did see our new hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, have solid early uptake by our customers.
Wireless declined 2%, led by a decline in controllers and soft E-rate funding, partially offset by strong growth in Meraki with our cloud-managed product line.
Security grew 11% with deferred revenue growth of 39% as we transition to more software and recurring revenue. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security, up 100% as well as web security solutions, which was up 60%.
Services grew 7% with our ongoing focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we're making progress each quarter on our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 12% with product up 19% and services up 8%. The portion of our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% to $3.8 billion. From an orders perspective, total product orders declined 2% with book to bill below 1.
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was down 4%. EMEA grew 1%, and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 2%.
In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 5%. Commercial grew 1%. Public sector was flat, and Service Provider declined 12%.
We are driving consistent profitability. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 65.2%, growing 0.3 points with product gross margin of 64.8%, up 0.3 points and service gross margin flat at 66.2%.
We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.6%, improving 0.2 points. We remain disciplined and focused on increasing operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61, up 3%. GAAP EPS was $0.46.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. We completed 3 acquisitions in Q1, increasing our investments in key priority and growth areas, including CloudLock, which specializes in cloud access security broker technology, which is part of our Security business; ContainerX that develops enterprise-class container management technology; and Worklife, which develops meeting software that is complementary to our Collaboration business.
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $71 billion with $10.4 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend.
To summarize, we executed well in Q1, delivering strong profitable growth. We also made solid progress in our transition to more software and subscription-based models. We're committed to making the key strategic moves and disciplined investments to drive long-term financial performance and deliver shareholder value.
So now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q2 of fiscal year '16. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.
So I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

I'm very pleased with the success of the investments we've made in priority growth areas such as Security, Collaboration and our ACI platform. These areas are key building blocks, along with our strong franchise in Switching and routing that place Cisco in a unique position with our customers as they become increasingly digital.
As you've seen with our Meraki platform, we have achieved rapid adoption of cloud-managed networking with enterprise, security and policy delivered as a service. Over the next several years, we will bring this automation, management and security at scale to the balance of our Switching and routing portfolio as we continue to offer new consumption models aligned to our customers' needs. While this is no small task, it's an incredible opportunity for Cisco as we bring this successful model to the largest part of our business. As we make these investments, we also remain firmly committed to operational discipline and driving long-term value for our customers and shareholders, and I'm very optimistic about our future.
Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions."

I mean, the Switching results are very disappointing. Clearly, the Wireless is now declining. Data Center -- and I've been asking you about Data Center for 3 quarters in a row, and it's still not delivering. And you've had some changes in leadership over there as well but suggests still not where it needs to be. I guess, I'm trying to gauge how much of the challenges that you have seen here right now, in your opinion, are macro driven versus, perhaps, portfolio driven because it seems like a lot of competitors in some of these areas are actually doing very well in switching, for example, in Aruba and wireless. HP, even in the data center, is doing well. Nutanix, clearly doing well. And these are key major areas for you, and we're seeing revenue declines. So help us understand kind of a little bit what's going on under the surface here. And what is it that makes you feel comfortable that there's no big problem? Or on the flip side, is there anything on the portfolio side that you think could kind of turn the tide here?"

So let me hit a few of those areas, and let me first just acknowledge that there are always areas that we can execute more effectively. So we are -- we're working right now -- the teams have been working, over the last year, on innovation in many of the areas that you mentioned, and again, I'm optimistic about the pipeline of innovation that we have right now. I think, when you look at the Switching portfolio, for us, back in January, when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise campus refresh, it's just basically maintained. It stayed the same way throughout the year. So I'm pretty comfortable with our position there. And as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud-based management to the rest of the portfolio, I think that, that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh. For me, it's really about, as we look at the key driver of refresh over the longer term in the campus, I think it's going to be really around automation, which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network. In a couple of the other areas you mentioned, I think, in UCS, there's been a fundamental shift in the data center to -- again, we've talked about the rack technology. And in hyperconverged, we have some early success with HyperFlex, and we have some new capabilities that'll be coming out after the first of the calendar year that I think will help us in that space. And on the Wireless front, I think there are really -- I think there are 2 key drivers there. First of all is we're -- the market is transitioning to a controller-less architecture. So in large part, our access points were actually positive, but the controller side of that business was down. Meraki was positive. And then also, we're a pretty substantial recipient of E-Rate business. So as that has moved out much more slowly than expected, I think that, that has also impacted that business. So hopefully, that gives you some color around those areas."

You can assume that we have done an account by account by account analysis in that space and understand what's going on there. Right now I think there are unique set of characteristics, particularly in the SP space. You have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which, I think, has led to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by the analysts as well as you have the political and regulatory environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the U.S. and around the world. Some of those could turn more favorable. Some of those could remain negative. We're just not going to model any improvement there. And that's the real reason for the guide, just to be clear on that.

So for example, just using Cisco ONE as an example in this quarter, it would have been 1.5 points just on that if we had recognized it perpetually like we had a year ago. So it's, for sure, about at least 2 points, and clearly, that continues to grow and accelerate. So you can assume we're assuming that in my guidance.

You guys -- it's 25% of our business roughly, and it was down 12% in new orders. And you guys know the content of our revenue that is from current quarter bookings. So the forecast this past quarter and the performance was negative 12, and we're just not modeling right now any improvement. Simona, you've written some great stuff around the SP CapEx environment, and so I think you know it as well as anyone. And while there is some forward-looking optimism, many of those cases, there's money being spent on density in mobile networks and areas that we may not be a direct recipient as well as we also know there's a lot of variability in how the actuals actually play out vis-a-vis the forecast. So we're just making sure that we really see that. I think there's also consternation around the world relative to what's going to happen in the political environment and just a little bit of a wait and see. And I think that's going to have an impact, could be positive, could be tough, based on the SP CapEx. But most of the guide challenge that we have is related to SP. Kelly, anything to add?"

Obviously, has been pointed out, is that it's developing pretty well. But I'm wondering 2 things. First, the pace of acquisitions and specifically, what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions seem to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. So I'm just wondering if you're feeling like you've got the portfolio and the technology where you need it. Or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high and that, perhaps, those reaccelerate? And my second question is on Security, and I think, Kelly, you kind of alluded to this. But at what point do we start to see incremental benefit on some of the other businesses from security footprint? It seems like a lot of the value of security can be tied to new hardware and switching and networking, et cetera. So should we expect to see some incremental pull-through or benefit to the more traditional hardware businesses? And if so, when should we expect that?"

So as it relates to the first part of your question, on the acquisition capabilities, I think what you'll find with this team is that there is a ton of internal innovation that's occurring. We, again, at the Partner Summit launched AMP for Endpoints, which is to bring the endpoints into the consolidated architecture. You can assume that we are actively continuing to scan the landscape relative to acquisitions that fit within the architecture that bring new capabilities. I think that when I took the role, I would probably suggest that there was a little bit of a pent-up demand around some companies that teams wanted to move on, and we moved relatively quickly in the first year or so. But I wouldn't assume that, that suggests that there's no more activity that we will see there. I think we will. As it relates to the core networking platforms and at what point we'll see Security pulling through, I think we have had some examples over the last few years where we've seen, particularly security portfolios integrated into routing platforms as the teams have done that we have seen, as we sell those as licenses that run on top of routers, assuming the routers have the right horsepower, they're fine. If they don't, then they'll drive a refresh. There are some capabilities the teams are working on that actually provide security at the packet level inside the network. And our intent over the next several quarters is to bring some of that technology to market and give our customers greater visibility and give them another -- yet another source of contributing to the threat landscape out of the network itself. So we'll have to wait and see how successful we are, but that's our plan."

And then there are some providers around the world, not necessarily in the U.S. even, that have -- that are dealing with political dynamics and potential regulatory issues that just aren't clear.

I wouldn't -- I don't -- I have not heard a lot of, say, U.S.-based service providers who have paused directly related to the election, but I do believe that the regulatory environment in the U.S. is obviously in flux now around the telecom environment.

So the recurring revenue number, I think, is what you're talking about, which is a combination of our product recurring revenue from the software and SaaS businesses plus the recurring revenue from services. So this quarter, that was 29%, and we continue to make progress off of product. That has grown to be 9%, up from 6% and of our product revenue in Q1 '16, so we continue to make progress there. So that's up to 29% versus -- it was 28% in Q4 and 25.5% in Q1 so making progress there. On the pricing question, Paul, we're definitely in the same ranges that we normally have been. It's actually year-over-year slightly better than we were last quarter, which is largely driven by the mix of what we saw. So I'd say it's in normal ranges, but how we're driving that internally is, of course, we're very disciplined around pricing like we've talked about. But we empower our sales leaders and country leaders to -- we measure them on 3 things. We measure them on revenue them. We measure them on operating margin growth, and we measure them on driving market share. And they're empowered to make tradeoffs between those, and if they need to give more price to win the franchise they want to win, they will do that. So the good news is they're, again, continuing to be very disciplined, making those tradeoffs, and the pricing is staying in the normal ranges."

So I think that over the next year to 2 years that a lot of the complexity in building out private infrastructure and private clouds for our customers will be alleviated, right?

I think that, that level of simplicity and those capabilities will improve. I think what we see is best represented by our ACI portfolio. When you look at our customers who are building out modern data center infrastructure, I think those are representative of the customers who believe that they're going to have a hybrid environment. And that piece of business grew 33%. It's up to $3 billion run rate. So I think your observations are probably valid, particularly if you look at like a lot of the OpenStack, early OpenStack implementations.

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
As is customary, in Q1, we made certain reclassifications to our prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
As a reminder, in Q2 fiscal 2016, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2017. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck."

So we delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging. We executed very well in the quarter with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3%, along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins.
This quarter, total product orders declined 2%, largely due to Service Provider orders declining 12%, which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter. We continue to show great progress in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change, including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time, we're delivering more innovation with simple, intelligent, automated solutions with industry leading security across our portfolio.
Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum. First, Security. Our Security revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based recurring business resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%. Our competitive position in Security is growing stronger as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we're the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I'm incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago, establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers.
This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions with AMP revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally. We also see ongoing traction with our next-generation firewall, revenue growing over 35%, as we added 5,300 customers in Q1, bringing our total next-gen firewall customer base to approximately 62,000.
Going forward, we're driving innovation as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over 2 weeks ago at our Partner Summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for Endpoints, a SaaS-based cloud-managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and effective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture.
Second, our next-generation data center. Our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We are investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership. To do this, we are delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers' widespread adoption of Cisco's ACI family of data center networking products continued in Q1 with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion. The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move workloads in and out of public cloud environments while maintaining enterprise security and policy.
We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through Tetration, agnostic cloud management with cloud center from our CliQr acquisition and our hyper-converged offering, HyperFlex. This will give our customers flexibility, agility and savings by delivering the benefits of both private and public clouds. We have a unique set of capabilities to lead in this market and address our customers' needs for delivering business applications quickly, cost effectively and at scale.
In Collaboration, we are adding new capabilities to our collaboration and IoT offerings through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. As a global market leader, Cisco's Collaboration business has a solid foundation to drive our roadmap of products and services that will increasingly be delivered from the cloud such as Spark, our end-to-end business collaboration suite.
Over the last few months, we've added 2 significant partners to our collaboration ecosystem. We announced a global strategic alliance with Salesforce to natively integrate Cisco's cloud collaboration platform with Salesforce's Lightning platform. This will deliver expanded reach and relevance as part of our cloud strategy.
We also formed an alliance with IBM to further enhance the collaboration experience for our customers by combining our collaboration and analytics technologies. We are integrating our Cisco Spark and WebEx offerings with IBM's cloud collaboration solutions along with cognitive computing capabilities enabled by the IBM Watson platform.
While the dynamics in Service Provider and emerging markets continue to present headwinds to overall growth, I'm pleased with our success in accelerating our momentum in our key investment areas and our commitment to operational discipline. Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q1 results and outlook in more detail."

We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up",797,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up 3%. We expanded our profitability year-over-year with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin.
Let me provide some details on revenue. Total product revenue was down 1%. We saw Switching decline 7% driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33% as Chuck mentioned. In campus, we still see a pause in enterprise spend largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment. Routing grew 6%, driven by growth in both SP core and edge.
Collaboration was down 3%, although we did have solid order growth. The revenue decrease was driven by TelePresence and Unified Communications endpoints, partially offset by strong growth of 10% in conferencing as we see more customers each quarter committing to WebEx. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue up 14%.
Data Center declined 3%, impacted by the market shift we've seen from blade to rack. While not significant in terms of revenue at this point, we did see our new hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, have solid early uptake by our customers.
Wireless declined 2%, led by a decline in controllers and soft E-rate funding, partially offset by strong growth in Meraki with our cloud-managed product line.
Security grew 11% with deferred revenue growth of 39% as we transition to more software and recurring revenue. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security, up 100% as well as web security solutions, which was up 60%.
Services grew 7% with our ongoing focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we're making progress each quarter on our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 12% with product up 19% and services up 8%. The portion of our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% to $3.8 billion. From an orders perspective, total product orders declined 2% with book to bill below 1.
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was down 4%. EMEA grew 1%, and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 2%.
In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 5%. Commercial grew 1%. Public sector was flat, and Service Provider declined 12%.
We are driving consistent profitability. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 65.2%, growing 0.3 points with product gross margin of 64.8%, up 0.3 points and service gross margin flat at 66.2%.
We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.6%, improving 0.2 points. We remain disciplined and focused on increasing operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61, up 3%. GAAP EPS was $0.46.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. We completed 3 acquisitions in Q1, increasing our investments in key priority and growth areas, including CloudLock, which specializes in cloud access security broker technology, which is part of our Security business; ContainerX that develops enterprise-class container management technology; and Worklife, which develops meeting software that is complementary to our Collaboration business.
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $71 billion with $10.4 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend.
To summarize, we executed well in Q1, delivering strong profitable growth. We also made solid progress in our transition to more software and subscription-based models. We're committed to making the key strategic moves and disciplined investments to drive long-term financial performance and deliver shareholder value.
So now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q2 of fiscal year '16. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.
So I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

I'm very pleased with the success of the investments we've made in priority growth areas such as Security, Collaboration and our ACI platform. These areas are key building blocks, along with our strong franchise in Switching and routing that place Cisco in a unique position with our customers as they become increasingly digital.
As you've seen with our Meraki platform, we have achieved rapid adoption of cloud-managed networking with enterprise, security and policy delivered as a service. Over the next several years, we will bring this automation, management and security, at scale, to the balance of our Switching and routing portfolio as we continue to offer new consumption models aligned to our customers' needs. While this is no small task, it's an incredible opportunity for Cisco as we bring this successful model to the largest part of our business. As we make these investments, we also remain firmly committed to operational discipline and driving long-term value for our customers and shareholders, and I'm very optimistic about our future.

Data Center -- and I've been asking you about Data Center for 3 quarters in a row, and it's still not delivering. And you've had some changes in leadership over there as well which suggests still not where it needs to be. I guess, I'm trying to gauge how much of the challenges that you have seen here right now, in your opinion, are macro driven versus, perhaps, portfolio driven because it seems like a lot of competitors in some of these areas are actually doing very well in switching, for example, in Aruba and wireless. HP, even in the data center, is doing well. Nutanix, clearly doing well. And these are key major areas for you, and we're seeing revenue declines. So help us understand kind of a little bit what's going on under the surface here. And what is it that makes you feel comfortable that there's no big problem? Or on the flip side, is there anything on the portfolio side that you think could kind of turn the tide here?"

So let me hit a few of those areas, and let me first just acknowledge that there are always areas that we can execute more effectively. So we are -- we're working right now -- the teams have been working, over the last year, on innovation in many of the areas that you mentioned, and again, I'm optimistic about the pipeline of innovation that we have right now. I think, when you look at the Switching portfolio, for us, back in January, when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise campus refresh, it's just basically maintained. It stayed the same way throughout the year. So I'm pretty comfortable with our position there. And as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud-based management to the rest of the portfolio, I think that, that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh. For me, it's really about, as we look at the key driver of refresh over the longer term in the campus, I think it's going to be really around automation, which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network. In a couple of the other areas you mentioned, I think, in UCS, there's been a fundamental shift in the data center to -- again, we've talked about the rack technology. And in hyperconverged, we have some early success with HyperFlex, and we have some new capabilities that'll be coming out after the first of the calendar year that I think will help us in that space. And on the Wireless front, I think there are really -- I think there are 2 key drivers there. First of all is we're -- the market is transitioning to a controller-less architecture. So in large part, our access points were actually positive, but the controller side of that business was down. Meraki was positive. And then also, we're a pretty substantial recipient of E-Rate business. So as that has moved out much more slowly than expected, I think that, that has also impacted that business. So hopefully, that gives you some color around those areas."

You can assume that we have done an account by account by account analysis in that space and understand what's going on there.

You have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which, I think, has led to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by the analysts as well as you have the political and regulatory environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the U.S. and around the world. Some of those could turn more favorable. Some of those could remain negative. We're just not going to model any improvement there.

And my guidance for the next quarter is as Chuck mentioned, right? We definitely saw the same thing we saw last quarter with the slowdown in SP, but it actually accelerated. And I wouldn't call my guidance conservative. I'd say it's absolutely what we see right now based on all of the factors we take into account."

But regardless, it looks like routing was quite strong. So what other products within that Service Provider vertical accounted for the weakness? And when we look at the CapEx trends, they definitely have been weak year-to-date, but they're implied to improve quite a bit into year-end. So just curious if you're not seeing that."

Obviously, as has been pointed out, is that it's developing pretty well. But I'm wondering 2 things. First, the pace of acquisitions and specifically, what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions seem to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. So I'm just wondering if you're feeling like you've got the portfolio and the technology where you need it. Or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high and that, perhaps, those reaccelerate? And my second question is on Security, and I think, Kelly, you kind of alluded to this. But at what point do we start to see incremental benefit on some of the other businesses from security footprint? It seems like a lot of the value of security can be tied to new hardware and switching and networking, et cetera. So should we expect to see some incremental pull-through or benefit to the more traditional hardware businesses? And if so, when should we expect that?"

So as it relates to the first part of your question, on the acquisition capabilities, I think what you'll find with this team is that there is a ton of internal innovation that's occurring. We, again, at the Partner Summit launched AMP for Endpoints, which is to bring the endpoints into the consolidated architecture. You can assume that we are actively continuing to scan the landscape relative to acquisitions that fit within the architecture that bring new capabilities. I think that when I took the role, I would probably suggest that there was a little bit of a pent-up demand around some companies that teams wanted to move on, and we moved relatively quickly in the first year or so. But I wouldn't assume that, that suggests that there's no more activity that we will see there. I think we will. As it relates to the core networking platforms and at what point we'll see Security pulling through, I think we have had some examples over the last few years where we've seen, particularly security portfolios integrated into routing platforms as the teams have done that we have seen, as we sell those as licenses that run on top of routers, assuming the routers have the right horsepower, they're fine. If they don't, then they'll drive a refresh. There are some capabilities the teams are working on that actually provide security at the packet level inside the network. And our intent over the next several quarters is to bring some of that technology to market and give our customers greater visibility and give them another -- yet another source of contributing to the threat landscape out of the network itself. So we'll have to wait and see how successful we are, but that's our plan."

And then there are some providers around the world, not necessarily in the U.S. even, that have -- that are dealing with political dynamics and potential regulatory issues that just aren't clear.

So the recurring revenue number, I think, is what you're talking about, which is a combination of our product recurring revenue from the software and SaaS businesses plus the recurring revenue from services. So this quarter, that was 29%, and we continue to make progress off of product. That has grown to be 9%, up from 6% and of our product revenue in Q1 '16, so we continue to make progress there. So that's up to 29% versus -- it was 28% in Q4 and 25.5% in Q1 so making progress there. On the pricing question, Paul, we're definitely in the same ranges that we normally have been. It's actually year-over-year slightly better than we were last quarter, which is largely driven by the mix of what we saw. So I'd say it's in normal ranges, but how we're driving that internally is, of course, we're very disciplined around pricing like we've talked about. But we empower our sales leaders and country leaders to -- we measure them on 3 things. We measure them on revenue them. We measure them on operating margin growth, and we measure them on driving market share. And they're empowered to make tradeoffs between those, and if they need to give more price to win the franchise they want to win, they will do that. So the good news is they're, again, continuing to be very disciplined, making those tradeoffs, and the pricing is staying in the normal ranges."

I think that, that level of simplicity and those capabilities will improve. I think what we see is best represented by our ACI portfolio.

So we're going to watch it very closely and look forward to as the details flush out there. But just high level, as you can imagine, we have many, many scenarios of what we would do when repatriation comes, which is a combination of, obviously, we would ring fence in our debt, and then we would have a blend of actions we can certainly take with our dividend as well as our share buyback as well as leaving flexibility for us to be able to do M&A and strategic investments. So it would be a combination of all those things. Obviously, we listen very closely to our shareholders on how we want to do that, and we recognize it'll certainly give us a lot more flexibility. And I guess, I'm sorry. I apologize."

Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
As is customary, in Q1, we made certain reclassifications to our prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
As a reminder, in Q2 fiscal 2016, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2017. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.

So we delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging. We executed very well in the quarter with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3%, along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins.
This quarter, total product orders declined 2%, largely due to Service Provider orders declining 12%, which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter. We continue to show great progress in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change, including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time, we're delivering more innovation with simple, intelligent, automated solutions with industry leading security across our portfolio.
Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum. First, Security. Our Security revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based recurring business resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%. Our competitive position in Security is growing stronger as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we're the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I'm incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago, establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers.
This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions with AMP revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally. We also see ongoing traction with our next-generation firewall, revenue growing over 35%, as we added 5,300 customers in Q1, bringing our total next-gen firewall customer base to approximately 62,000.
Going forward, we're driving innovation as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over 2 weeks ago at our Partner Summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for Endpoints, a SaaS-based cloud-managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and effective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture.
Second, our next-generation data center. Our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We are investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership. To do this, we are delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers' widespread adoption of Cisco's ACI family of data center networking products continued in Q1 with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion. The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move workloads in and out of public cloud environments while maintaining enterprise security and policy.
We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through Tetration, agnostic cloud management with cloud center from our CliQr acquisition and our hyper-converged offering, HyperFlex. This will give our customers flexibility, agility and savings by delivering the benefits of both private and public clouds. We have a unique set of capabilities to lead in this market and address our customers' needs for delivering business applications quickly, cost effectively and at scale.
In Collaboration, we are adding new capabilities to our collaboration and IoT offerings through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. As a global market leader, Cisco's Collaboration business has a solid foundation to drive our roadmap of products and services that will increasingly be delivered from the cloud such as Spark, our end-to-end business collaboration suite.
Over the last few months, we've added 2 significant partners to our collaboration ecosystem. We announced a global strategic alliance with Salesforce to natively integrate Cisco's cloud collaboration platform with Salesforce's Lightning platform. This will deliver expanded reach and relevance as part of our cloud strategy.
We also formed an alliance with IBM to further enhance the collaboration experience for our customers by combining our collaboration and analytics technologies. We are integrating our Cisco Spark and WebEx offerings with IBM's cloud collaboration solutions along with cognitive computing capabilities enabled by the IBM Watson platform.
While the dynamics in Service Provider and emerging markets continue to present headwinds to overall growth, I'm pleased with our success in accelerating our momentum in our key investment areas and our commitment to operational discipline. Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q1 results and outlook in more detail."

We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up",797,"Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up 3%. We expanded our profitability year-over-year with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin.
Let me provide some details on revenue. Total product revenue was down 1%. We saw Switching decline 7% driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33% as Chuck mentioned. In campus, we still see a pause in enterprise spend largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment. Routing grew 6%, driven by growth in both SP core and edge.
Collaboration was down 3%, although we did have solid order growth. The revenue decrease was driven by TelePresence and Unified Communications endpoints, partially offset by strong growth of 10% in conferencing as we see more customers each quarter committing to WebEx. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue up 14%.
Data Center declined 3%, impacted by the market shift we've seen from blade to rack. While not significant in terms of revenue at this point, we did see our new hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, have solid early uptake by our customers.
Wireless declined 2%, led by a decline in controllers and soft E-rate funding, partially offset by strong growth in Meraki with our cloud-managed product line.
Security grew 11% with deferred revenue growth of 39% as we transition to more software and recurring revenue. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security, up 100% as well as web security solutions, which was up 60%.
Services grew 7% with our ongoing focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we're making progress each quarter on our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 12% with product up 19% and services up 8%. The portion of our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% to $3.8 billion. From an orders perspective, total product orders declined 2% with book to bill below 1.
Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was down 4%. EMEA grew 1%, and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 2%.
In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 5%. Commercial grew 1%. Public sector was flat, and Service Provider declined 12%.
We are driving consistent profitability. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 65.2%, growing 0.3 points with product gross margin of 64.8%, up 0.3 points and service gross margin flat at 66.2%.
We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.6%, improving 0.2 points. We remain disciplined and focused on increasing operational efficiencies and productivity.
In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61, up 3%. GAAP EPS was $0.46.
Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. We completed 3 acquisitions in Q1, increasing our investments in key priority and growth areas, including CloudLock, which specializes in cloud access security broker technology, which is part of our Security business; ContainerX that develops enterprise-class container management technology; and Worklife, which develops meeting software that is complementary to our Collaboration business.
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q1, we delivered operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $71 billion with $10.4 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend.
To summarize, we executed well in Q1, delivering strong profitable growth. We also made solid progress in our transition to more software and subscription-based models. We're committed to making the key strategic moves and disciplined investments to drive long-term financial performance and deliver shareholder value.
So now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year '17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year '17 is as follows. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q2 of fiscal year '16. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.
So I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call."

I'm very pleased with the success of the investments we've made in priority growth areas such as Security, Collaboration and our ACI platform. These areas are key building blocks, along with our strong franchise in Switching and routing that place Cisco in a unique position with our customers as they become increasingly digital.
As you've seen with our Meraki platform, we have achieved rapid adoption of cloud-managed networking with enterprise, security and policy delivered as a service. Over the next several years, we will bring this automation, management and security, at scale, to the balance of our Switching and routing portfolio as we continue to offer new consumption models aligned to our customers' needs. While this is no small task, it's an incredible opportunity for Cisco as we bring this successful model to the largest part of our business. As we make these investments, we also remain firmly committed to operational discipline and driving long-term value for our customers and shareholders, and I'm very optimistic about our future.

Data Center -- and I've been asking you about Data Center for 3 quarters in a row, and it's still not delivering. And you've had some changes in leadership over there as well which suggests still not where it needs to be. I guess, I'm trying to gauge how much of the challenges that you have seen here right now, in your opinion, are macro driven versus, perhaps, portfolio driven because it seems like a lot of competitors in some of these areas are actually doing very well in switching, for example, in Aruba and wireless. HP, even in the data center, is doing well. Nutanix, clearly doing well. And these are key major areas for you, and we're seeing revenue declines. So help us understand kind of a little bit what's going on under the surface here. And what is it that makes you feel comfortable that there's no big problem? Or on the flip side, is there anything on the portfolio side that you think could kind of turn the tide here?"

So let me hit a few of those areas, and let me first just acknowledge that there are always areas that we can execute more effectively. So we are -- we're working right now -- the teams have been working, over the last year, on innovation in many of the areas that you mentioned, and again, I'm optimistic about the pipeline of innovation that we have right now. I think, when you look at the Switching portfolio, for us, back in January, when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise campus refresh, it's just basically maintained. It stayed the same way throughout the year. So I'm pretty comfortable with our position there. And as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud-based management to the rest of the portfolio, I think that, that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh. For me, it's really about, as we look at the key driver of refresh over the longer term in the campus, I think it's going to be really around automation, which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network. In a couple of the other areas you mentioned, I think, in UCS, there's been a fundamental shift in the data center to -- again, we've talked about the rack technology. And in hyperconverged, we have some early success with HyperFlex, and we have some new capabilities that'll be coming out after the first of the calendar year that I think will help us in that space. And on the Wireless front, I think there are really -- I think there are 2 key drivers there. First of all is we're -- the market is transitioning to a controller-less architecture. So in large part, our access points were actually positive, but the controller side of that business was down. Meraki was positive. And then also, we're a pretty substantial recipient of E-Rate business. So as that has moved out much more slowly than expected, I think that, that has also impacted that business. So hopefully, that gives you some color around those areas."

You can assume that we have done an account by account by account analysis in that space and understand what's going on there.

You have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which, I think, has led to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by the analysts as well as you have the political and regulatory environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the U.S. and around the world. Some of those could turn more favorable. Some of those could remain negative. We're just not going to model any improvement there.

So you have product revenue slightly down in the quarter, but I would assume that a lot of that is related to the transition toward your subscription business model -- so do you have an estimate of how much this transition has impacted your number this quarter? And then, of course, I have the same question for next quarter. Your guide is very conservative. How much of your -- this transition is actually impacting your guide for Q2 as well?"

So for example, just using Cisco ONE as an example in this quarter, it would have been 1.5 points just on that if we had recognized it perpetually like we had a year ago. So it's, for sure, about at least 2 points, and clearly, that continues to grow and accelerate. So you can assume we're assuming that in my guidance. And my guidance for the next quarter is as Chuck mentioned, right? We definitely saw the same thing we saw last quarter with the slowdown in SP, but it actually accelerated.

Obviously, as has been pointed out, is that it's developing pretty well. But I'm wondering 2 things. First, the pace of acquisitions and specifically, what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions seem to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. So I'm just wondering if you're feeling like you've got the portfolio and the technology where you need it. Or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high and that, perhaps, those reaccelerate? And my second question is on Security, and I think, Kelly, you kind of alluded to this. But at what point do we start to see incremental benefit on some of the other businesses from security footprint? It seems like a lot of the value of security can be tied to new hardware and switching and networking, et cetera. So should we expect to see some incremental pull-through or benefit to the more traditional hardware businesses? And if so, when should we expect that?"

We, again, at the Partner Summit launched AMP for Endpoints, which is to bring the endpoints into the consolidated architecture. You can assume that we are actively continuing to scan the landscape relative to acquisitions that fit within the architecture that bring new capabilities. I think that when I took the role, I would probably suggest that there was a little bit of a pent-up demand around some companies that teams wanted to move on, and we moved relatively quickly in the first year or so. But I wouldn't assume that, that suggests that there's no more activity that we will see there. I think we will. As it relates to the core networking platforms and at what point we'll see Security pulling through, I think we have had some examples over the last few years where we've seen, particularly security portfolios integrated into routing platforms as the teams have done that we have seen, as we sell those as licenses that run on top of routers, assuming the routers have the right horsepower, they're fine. If they don't, then they'll drive a refresh. There are some capabilities the teams are working on that actually provide security at the packet level inside the network. And our intent over the next several quarters is to bring some of that technology to market and give our customers greater visibility and give them another -- yet another source of contributing to the threat landscape out of the network itself.

So this quarter, that was 29%, and we continue to make progress off of product. That has grown to be 9%, up from 6% and of our product revenue in Q1 '16, so we continue to make progress there. So that's up to 29% versus -- it was 28% in Q4 and 25.5% in Q1 so making progress there. On the pricing question, Paul, we're definitely in the same ranges that we normally have been. It's actually year-over-year slightly better than we were last quarter, which is largely driven by the mix of what we saw. So I'd say it's in normal ranges, but how we're driving that internally is, of course, we're very disciplined around pricing like we've talked about. But we empower our sales leaders and country leaders to -- we measure them on 3 things. We measure them on revenue them. We measure them on operating margin growth, and we measure them on driving market share. And they're empowered to make tradeoffs between those, and if they need to give more price to win the franchise they want to win, they will do that.

I'd say -- and let's just talk about Switching. I'd say, for campus switching, which is 2/3 roughly of our entire Switching business, which is our biggest business unit, I'd say most of that is macro, right? I mean, it is the one area -- and I think we've talked about this before. It's the one area that people can put off doing a refresh if there is any macro concern, and that's what we typically see anytime you see any economic pause or macro event. So I do truly feel that if the optimism we've seen this week in the stock market continues, giving that feeling of optimism in the economy, I would expect that to raise all boats in our campus switching side. I'd say, on the Data Center side, you understand the dynamic there, right? For the -- to your point, we launched a fantastic product a couple of years ago, but we had to manage through the transition of a very sizable legacy business, Data Center portfolio declining as that accelerated. And so we managed through that. And again, that business has continued to grow as we go through that intersection and cross through now as legacy piece we've worked largely through. So I'd say -- that's why I say it's largely macro, especially on the campus side."

Obviously, you and many other companies in the tech space have been advocating repatriation for decades, a very long time.

So we're encouraged that something will happen. Now, it's very early, and we don't really know the details besides what his platform was during his campaign. So we're going to watch it very closely and look forward to as the details flush out there. But just high level, as you can imagine, we have many, many scenarios of what we would do when repatriation comes, which is a combination of, obviously, we would ring fence in our debt, and then we would have a blend of actions we can certainly take with our dividend as well as our share buyback as well as leaving flexibility for us to be able to do M&A and strategic investments. So it would be a combination of all those things. Obviously, we listen very closely to our shareholders on how we want to do that, and we recognize it'll certainly give us a lot more flexibility. And I guess, I'm sorry. I apologize."
