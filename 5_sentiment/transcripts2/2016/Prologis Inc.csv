At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remains exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up the year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints",695,"Thanks, Tracy, and good morning. At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remains exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up the year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints supply are creating favorable conditions around the world. Focusing on the top global original markets has helped us outperform the broader market. 
Core FFO grew 19% year-over-year. Occupancy reached a record 96.9% and rents increased 13%. We're 2 years into our 3-year strategic plan and have already exceeded all of our financial goals a year ahead of plan. Core FFO however, doesn't tell the whole story. While the key drivers of our operating performance on core FFO, our occupancy, rent and fees, we also create value from our development and value-added conversions. 
The results of these activities materially add to our NAV. Last year, value creation totaled $700 million, representing an additional $1.30 per share of NAV. Industrial real estate market conditions are healthy in most of the world in spite of concerns about emerging market economies, including slower growth in China. In Europe for example, where we've allocated significant capital over the last several years, value appreciation has been extremely robust. 
While several macroeconomic indicators tell a mixed story around the world, those most correlated with our business point to favorable business trends in 2015. These include: global consumption with flat growth in '16, at over 4%; global trade, up in '16 by about 3.5%; U.S. container imports, up in '16 by about 5.5%; and strong e-commerce with growth again in the double-digits. 
The best indicator for our business however, is the health and outlook offer customers. Their space needs tell the story of global consumption. For many customers, that story is one of continued expansions. Demand continues to exceed supply. As we said on our last call, equilibrium in the U.S. will likely be reached in late 2016. 
Globally our share in place portfolio rents is 10% under market today, which will lead to continued NOI growth ahead of inflation as leases turnover. We're disciplined about managing risk in our respective development with a focus on profitability, not volume. Unlike previous cycles, other developers and lenders in our sector also appear to be showing discipline. 
As a result, healthy supply demand environment continues, now in its sixth year. Supply-chain reconfiguration is a key long-term driver of our business. This is true for the full spectrum of our customer base. Where growth is slowing, customers are investing in ways to squeeze more efficiency out of their supply chain. Even in a low growth environment, our business can grow. 
At the other end of the spectrum, the growth in e-commerce continues to be a good source of demand for industrial real estate. Online sales grew 15% in the U.S. while traditional retail grew only 2%. The allure for brick-and-mortar retailers to create or expand our e-commerce business will continue well into the future. To meet consumer demand for faster deliveries, this channel requires facilities that are closer to labor and population centers. 
We speak regularly with our customers about their changing space needs. Good examples are Home Depot and Walmart. Once considered traditional retailers, they are well underway with major reconfigurations of their supply chain, designed to handle the rapidly changing e-commerce segment. 
Our existing building and development portfolio has accommodated our most sophisticated e-commerce customers needs, and has done so across the wide range of space configurations from the largest fulfillment master-planned parks, down to smaller last mile delivery centers in our infield buildings. We believe our business momentum will continue in 2016. This is due to steady market conditions and broad-based demand from other sectors such as food and beverage, automotive and electronics. 
The last several years, we work to realign our portfolio and strengthen our capital structure. We had an outstanding 2015 and made significant progress on our priorities, finishing the year better positioned than ever. The result is a business that outperforms during improving macro conditions that can capitalize on opportunities in the downturn. Based on our customers input and the position of our portfolio, we have a positive outlook for 2016. Tom?"

We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.64 per share for the quarter and $2.23 per share for the year, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth q",1137,"Thanks, Hamid. We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.64 per share for the quarter and $2.23 per share for the year, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth quarter from our pelp venture. We exceeded the top end of our guidance, primarily due to operations and timing of capital employment. 
Starting with operations. Occupancy reached an all-time high of 96.9% and was above 95% in every region. Our share of GAAP rent change was 12.4%, driven by the U.S. at 18%. The KTR assets had performed of our under running for both occupancy and rent change. KTR has been fully integrated in our portfolio and is included in the operating statistics I discussed. 
Our share of GAAP same-store NOI increased 6.6% in the quarter, driven by the U.S. at 8.7%. As we discussed last quarter, the negative impact of on GAAP -- on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger have fully burned off. This again, had a positive impact of about 100 basis points on GAAP same-store. 
Moving to our share of capital employment. We had an exceptional year and created significant value for shareholders. We stabilized $1.6 billion of developments with an estimated margin of 33%. The initial yield on these stabilizations was 7.3% and the incremental cash return, excluding our already own land was 9.2% [ph].  Dispositions and contributions totaled $2.5 billion at a 5.3% weighted average stabilized cap rate, and included $166 million of value creation from value-added conversions. 
Dispositions and contributions volumes was about $400 million short of the midpoint of our guidance. We elected to split a few sales across multiple buyers to maximize proceeds, and deferred certain contributions to amass better scale, pushing this activity into the first half of 2016. We started $1.8 billion of development. We've built [indiscernible] making up 44%. The starts will generate estimated value creation of $388 million and margin of 21%. 
Turning to capital markets. We had an active quarter and closed the year with our lines of credits fully undrawn, and reduced the short-term loan associated with the KHR acquisition to $400 million. We're on track to pay off the remainder of the term loan by the end of the first half of 2016, if not sooner. Our leverage on a book basis dropped 130 basis points to 38.4% at quarter end. 
Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains improved to 6x for the quarter. While leverage and debt to EBITDA are very important credit metrics, there are other factors, which demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet. The first is liquidity. We ended the year with over $2.8 billion of liquidity and only 12% of our debt maturing in the next 24 months. Maintaining significant liquidity at all times is a pillar of our balance sheet strategy, as it mitigates credit market disruptions that provides ready capital to be opportunistic. 
Second is our significant nominal EBITDA coverage. We had over $1.5 billion of annualized EBITDA in excess of our fixed charges,is underpinned by more than $25 billion of unencumbered assets. The bottom line is our balance sheet is in great shape and we expect it to get even stronger in 2016. 
Let's switch to 2016 guidance. For operation, we expect our year-end occupancy to range between 96% and 97%, and our share GAAP same store NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4.5%. Cash same store NOI growth should be higher than GAAP in 2016. The split of our share of NOI by geography will be approximately 80% Americas, 15% Europe and 5% Asia. We expect our share development stabilizations to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion as stabilization has increased meaningfully over the past 3 [ph] years and now approach our starts volume, continue to see significant annual NOI growth from our developments. 
For 2016, we expect FFO from development stabilization of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. Related to FX, our 2016 earnings are very well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations, and over 90% is already hedged. For net G&A, we're forecasting a range of $235 million to $245 million, essentially flat to last year at the midpoint, while managing more than $6 billion in assets. 
For strategic capital, we expect revenue without promotes to range between $180 million and $190 million. We have promote opportunities from 3 of our ventures in 2016, Patel and Pep 2, in the third quarter and USLV in the fourth quarter. We project net promotes to contribute between $0.17 and $0.19 per share to core FFO. The magnitude of these promotes is a testament to our strategic capital franchise, as well as our strategy to allocate capital to Europe over the last 5 years. 
Over this period, we took advantage of a dislocation in asset prices in the market. Our European portfolio has consistently outperformed the market in terms of both occupancy and returns. Our capital deployment guidance is spelled out in our supplemental. At the midpoint of our net deployment, we will generate proceeds of about $400 million. Additionally, we have 2 other very significant sources of cash in 2016. 
First, we will receive $199 million in cash in the first quarter from a completion of the installment sale related to Facebook. And second, we redeemed a total of $400 million between our USLF and Patel ventures, which we'll fund in the second quarter of 2016. These ownership rebalancing and these 2 open-ended funds is aligned with our long-term ownership targets and facilitates the deployment of substantial investment queues in these ventures. 
As a result, we expect to generate net deployment proceeds in excess of our capital needs of $1 billion in 2016 or $600 million after repayment of the last $400 million of the KTR term loan. Putting this altogether, we expect our 2016 core FFO to range between $2.50 and $2.60, including promotes. This represents 14% year-over-year growth or an increase of $0.32 per share at the midpoint. We expect AFFO growth will exceed core FFO growth in 2016. 
If we assume a normalized annual net promote of $0.05 per share, our core FFO range for 2016 would be between $2.38 a share and $2.46 a share, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. In closing, we had incredible year and enter 2016 with confidence, though mindful of potential economic cross currents. We have a portfolio that has never been in better shape, a strong balance sheet and a plan that grows core FFO 14%, pays off the remaining KTR debt, self-funds all deployment generates $1 billion of net deployment in excess for capital needs, maintain significant with liquidity and provides flexibility and optionality to adjust to changes in market conditions. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

One, when you look at our coverage in 2015, our coverage with development gains is 69%. Without development gains is 89%. For 2016, similar numbers would be with development gains of 65% roughly. And without development gains of about 75%. So we have significant AFFO coverage in excess of our dividend. Now you had a question about how the dividend might be impacted. If it could be impacted by changes in development. So what -- so the first thing you need to think about and I'm assuming you're referring to capitalized overhead and capitalized interest. So the first thing you need to think about though is how we're capitalizing development. We're capitalizing development by self funding, so we're selling assets and rolling those into development. And we're selling assets that are yielding, let's just call it 6%. And we're capping interest at a rate of roughly 3%. And when you look at our cap overhead, our cap overhead actually related to the development, annually is about $47 million. And when you express that $47 million over development, it's about 3%. So if you think about -- if we slow down development, let's just take an extreme example. Let's just assume there's no development. So if we had a development of $2 billion, we were going to sell $2 billion to fund that, the 6%, we were earning on that development is going to stay in our income statement. The interest expense that we would've capped is going to stay on our income statement. The overhead that we were going to cap is going to stay on our income statement, and you know what? There's a 0 impact on our income statement because all of that NOI that we would've used to fund that development, is going to stay on our books. So we're self-funding. So if the development slows down, then there are really no impact to our earnings."

They're completely based in the vast majority of cases on appraised values on a quarter by quarter basis at the time of the promotes. So actually selling assets doesn't do anything to the promotes. So I just wanted to clarify that. Secondly, I would say we have pretty good visibility into the valuations because we appraise the portfolio, particularly the deals that are in the ventures on a quarterly basis. We know what the carrying values are in the fourth quarter, and we put some sensitivity around that at scenarios that include cap rate expansion, flat cap rates, reducing cap rates. And we've picked up prudent number to project those. Now to answer your specific questions, the promotes today are based in the high 5, low 6% cap rates. And we think there's a bit of room in those numbers to the good. But we're not going to get ahead of ourselves now."

Tom, first of all, thank you for remembering that, because I think that's a very important part of our responsibilities to call out markets that have any risk of getting over built from our vantage point. And the reason I had mentioned it is because nothing has really changed in that regard. It's  Houston -- obviously, from demand reasons is a bit softer. Although, it's pulling up a bit better than we would've expected at this point. And that looks continues to have a lot of development but absorption is keeping pace. So, so far, so good, but we're really watching those 2 markets probably more than any others in the U.S. I would say going over to Europe, Paris is a bit soft and its not really a supply problem, it's more of a demand problem, and I think some of it has to do with some of this heritage stuff that went on last quarter. But I don't know if France has generally been a little bit slower. The place that's been surprisingly strong in Europe for us, has been Spain. Spain's really done a turn around and I would say, it's done extremely well. The U.K. was early in Europe. And we thought it got a little bit ahead of itself and it may go the other way or soften, it has and it continues to be pretty strong in terms of cap rates. And in the U.S., Chicago has been pretty good on the upside in the cycle. And the large California markets continue to be very, very strong. In the longer term, I'm a little concerned about the technology, sort of bubble and valuations and all that. And ultimately, that may have an impact on the area numbers not next year, but probably -- not that the year after. But we've essentially taken a lot of chip off the table from that R&D type of product. And I don't think it will have much of an effect on the distribution space."

330123,321595056,921036,"Prologis, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Prologis, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning. At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remains exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints su",701,"Thanks, Tracy, and good morning. At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remains exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints supply are creating favorable conditions around the world. Focusing on the top global and reginal markets has helped us outperform the broader market. 
Core FFO grew 19% year-over-year. Occupancy reached a record 96.9%, and rents increased 13%. We're 2 years into our 3-year strategic plan and have already exceeded all of our financial goals, a year ahead of plan. Core FFO, however, doesn't tell the whole story. While the key drivers of our operating performance on core FFO are occupancy, rent and fees, we also create value from our development and value-added conversions. 
The results of these activities materially add to our NAV. Last year, value creation totaled $700 million, representing an additional $1.30 per share of NAV. 
Industrial real estate market conditions are healthy in most of the world in spite of concerns about emerging market economies, including slower growth in China. In Europe, for example, where we've allocated significant capital over the last several years, value appreciation has been extremely robust. 
While several macroeconomic indicators tell a mixed story around the world, those most correlated with our business, point to favorable business trends in 2015. These include: global consumption with flat growth in '16, at over 4%; global trade, up in '16 by about 3.5%; U.S. container imports, up in '16 by about 5.5%; and strong e-commerce with growth again in the double digits.
The best indicator for our business, however, is the health and outlook of our customers. Their space needs tell the story of global consumption. For many customers, that story is one of continued expansions. Demand continues to exceed supply. As we said on our last call, equilibrium in the U.S. will likely be reached in late 2016.
Globally, our share of in-place portfolio rents is 10% under market today, which will lead to continued NOI growth ahead of inflation as leases turnover. We're disciplined about managing risk in our spec development, with a focus on profitability, not volume. Unlike previous cycles, other developers and lenders in our sector also appear to be showing discipline.
As a result, a healthy supply/demand environment continues, now in its sixth year. Supply chain reconfiguration is a key long-term driver of our business. This is true for the full spectrum of our customer base, where growth is slowing, customers are investing in ways to squeeze more efficiency out of their supply chain. Even in a low-growth environment, our business can grow.
At the other end of the spectrum, the growth in the e-commerce continues to be a source of demand for industrial real estate. Online sales grew 15% in the U.S., while traditional retail grew only 2%. The allure for brick-and-mortar retailers to create or expand their e-commerce business will continue well into the future. To meet consumer demand for faster deliveries, this channel requires facilities that are closer to labor and population centers.
We speak regularly with our customers about their changing space needs. Good examples are Home Depot and Walmart. Once considered traditional retailers, they are well underway with major reconfigurations of their supply chain, designed to handle the rapidly changing e-commerce segment. 
Our existing building and development portfolio has accommodated our most sophisticated e-commerce customers' needs and has done so across the wide range of space configurations from the largest fulfillment centers in our master-planned parks, down to smaller last mile delivery centers in our infill buildings. We believe our business momentum will continue in 2016. This is due to steady market conditions and broad-based demand from other sectors, such as food and beverage, automotive and electronics.
The last several years, we worked to realign our portfolio and strengthen our capital structure. We had an outstanding 2015 and made significant progress on our priorities, finishing the year better positioned than ever. The result is a business that outperforms during improving macro conditions and can capitalize on opportunities in the downturn. Based on our customers input and the position of our portfolio, we have a positive outlook for 2016. Tom?"

This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth q",1135,"Thanks, Hamid. We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.64 per share for the quarter and $2.23 per share for the year, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth quarter from our PELP venture. We exceeded the top end of our guidance, primarily due to operations and timing of capital deployment.
Starting with operations. Occupancy reached an all-time high of 96.9% and was above 95% in every region. Our share of GAAP rent change was 12.4%, driven by the U.S. at 18%. The KTR assets had performed ahead of our underwriting for both occupancy and rent change. KTR has been fully integrated in our portfolio and is included in the operating statistics I discussed. 
Our share of GAAP same-store NOI increased 6.6% in the quarter, driven by the U.S. at 8.7%. As we discussed last quarter, the negative impact of on GAAP -- on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger have fully burned off. This again had a positive impact of about 100 basis points on GAAP same-store. 
Moving to our share of capital employment. We had an exceptional year and created significant value for our shareholders. We stabilized $1.6 billion of developments with an estimated margin of 33%. The initial yield on these stabilizations was 7.3% and the incremental cash return, excluding already owned land was 9.2%. Dispositions and contributions totaled $2.5 billion at a 5.3% weighted average stabilized cap rate and included $166 million of value creation from value-added conversions.
Dispositions and contributions volume was about $400 million short of the midpoint of our guidance. We elected to split a few sales across multiple buyers to maximize proceeds, and deferred certain contributions to amass better scale, pushing this activity into the first half of 2016. We started $1.8 billion of development, with build-to-suits making up 44%. The starts will generate estimated value creation of $388 million and margin of 21%.
Turning to capital markets. We had an active quarter and closed the year with our lines of credit fully undrawn, and reduced the short-term loan associated with the KTR acquisition to $400 million. We're on track to pay off the remainder of the term loan by the end of the first half of 2016, if not sooner. Our leverage on a book base has dropped to 130 basis points to 38.4% at quarter end. 
Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains improved to 6x for the quarter. While leverage and debt-to-EBITDA are very important credit metrics, there are other factors, which demonstrate the strength of our balance sheet. The first is liquidity. We ended the year with over $2.8 billion of liquidity and only 12% of our debt maturing in the next 24 months. Maintaining significant liquidity at all times is a pillar of our balance sheet strategy, as it mitigates credit market disruptions and provides ready capital to be opportunistic. 
Second is our significant nominal EBITDA coverage. We have over $1.5 billion of annualized EBITDA in excess of our fixed charges, underpinned by more than $25 billion of unencumbered assets. The bottom line is our balance sheet is in great shape and we expect it to get even stronger in 2016. 
Let's switch to 2016 guidance. For operation, we expect our year-end occupancy to range between 96% and 97% and our share of GAAP same-store NOI growth between 3.5% and 4.5%. Cash same-store NOI growth should be higher than GAAP in 2016. The split of our share of NOI by geography will be approximately 80% Americas, 15% Europe and 5% Asia. We expect our share development stabilizations to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, as stabilizations have increased meaningfully over the past 3 years and now approach our starts volume, continue to see significant annual NOI growth from our developments. 
For 2016, we expect FFO from development stabilizations of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. Related to FX, our 2016 earnings are very well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations as over 90% is already hedged. For net G&A, we're forecasting a range of $235 million to $245 million, essentially flat to last year at the midpoint, while managing more than $6 billion in assets. 
For strategic capital, we expect revenue without promotes to range between $180 million and $190 million. We have promote opportunities from 3 of our ventures in 2016, PTELF and PEPF II in the third quarter and USLV in the fourth quarter. We project net promotes to contribute between $0.17 and $0.19 per share to core FFO. The magnitude of these promotes is a testament to our strategic capital franchise as well as our strategy to allocate capital to Europe over the last 5 years. 
Over this period, we took advantage of a dislocation in asset prices in the market. Our European portfolio has consistently outperformed the market in terms of both occupancy and returns. 
Our capital deployment guidance is spelled out in our supplemental. At the midpoint of our net deployment, we will generate proceeds of about $400 million. Additionally, we have 2 other varied significant sources of cash in 2016.
First, we will receive $198 million in cash in the first quarter from a completion of the installment sale related to Facebook. And second, we redeemed a total of $400 million between our USLF and PTELF ventures, which we'll fund in the second quarter of 2016. This ownership rebalancing in these 2 open-ended funds is aligned with our long-term ownership targets and facilitates the deployment of substantial investment queues in these ventures. 
As a result, we expect to generate net deployment proceeds in excess of our capital needs of $1 billion in 2016 or $600 million after repayment of the last $400 million of the KTR term loan. 
Putting this altogether, we expect our 2016 core FFO to range between $2.50 and $2.60 pre share, including promotes. This represents 14% year-over-year growth or an increase of $0.32 per share at the midpoint. We expect AFFO growth will exceed core FFO growth in 2016. 
If we assume a normalized annual net promote of $0.05 per share, our core FFO range for 2016 would be between $2.38 a share and $2.46 a share, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. In closing, we had an incredible year and enter 2016 with confidence though mindful of potential economic crosscurrents. We have a portfolio that has never been in better shape, a strong balance sheet and a plan that grows core FFO 14% pays off the remaining KTR debt; self funds all deployment; generates $1 billion of net deployment in excess for capital needs; maintain significant liquidity and it provides flexibility and optionality to adjust to changes in market conditions.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

One, when you look at our coverage in 2015, our coverage with development gains is 69%; without development gains is 89%. For 2016, similar numbers would be with development gains of 65% roughly and without development gains of about 75%. So we have significant AFFO coverage in excess of our dividend. Now you had a question about how the dividend might be impacted, if it could be impacted by changes in development. So what -- so the first thing you need to think about -- and I'm assuming you're referring to capitalized overhead and capitalized interest. So the first thing you need to think about though is how we're capitalizing development. We're capitalizing development by self funding, So we're selling assets and rolling those into development. And we're selling assets that are yielding, let's just call it 6%. And we're capping interest at a rate of roughly 3%. And when you look at our cap overhead, our capital overhead actually related to development, annually is about $47 million. And when you express that $47 million over development, it's about 3%. So if you think about -- if we slow down development, let's just take an extreme example. Let's just assume there's no development. So if we had development of $2 billion, we were going to sell $2 billion to fund that. The 6% we were earning on that development is going to stay in our income statement. The interest expense that we would've capped is going to stay in our income statement. The overhead that we were going to cap is going to stay on our income statement. And you know what? There's a 0 impact on our income statement, because all of that NOI that we would've used to fund that development, is going to stay on our books. So we're self-funding. So if the development slows down, never really impact -- no impact on our earnings."

And there is a lot of talk out there about what would the value of the portfolio be on a constant cap rate basis and the like. When you sell $8 billion from the lower tier of your portfolio, the mix has a very substantial impact on what cap rate is even in the steady environment on what's left in your portfolio. So we think the IRR at the end of the days is what matter, and those cap rates are higher because the growth rates are lower. And we feel really good about our capital allocation decisions. Just think about that capital we allocated to Europe couple of years ago. How do we fund that? We funded that by selling some nonstrategic assets in Europe. At the time, people thought we were crazy. We were selling assets in the U.S. in the mid 6s and low 7s, and we are buying assets in Europe in the low 8s. And those assets  that we bought in the low 8s are now in the high 5s and low 6s.

Tom, first of all, thank you for remembering that, because I think that's a very important part of our responsibilities to call out markets that have any risk of getting over built as from our vantage point. And the reason I hadn't mentioned it is because nothing has really changed in that regard. It's -- Houston, obviously, from demand reasons is a bit softer although it's holding up a bit better than we would've expected at this point. And Dallas continues to had a lot of development but absorption is keeping pace. So, so far, so good, but we're really watching those 2 markets probably more than any others in the U.S. I would say going over to Europe, Paris is a bit soft and its not really a supply problem, it's more of a demand problem. And I think some of it has to do with some of this heritage stuff that went on last quarter. But I don't know if France has generally been a little bit slower. The place that's been surprisingly strong in Europe for us, has been Spain. Spain's really done a turn around and I would say, it's done extremely well. The U.K. was early. In Europe -- and we thought it got a little bit ahead of itself and it may go the other way or soften. It hasn't, it continues to be pretty strong in terms of cap rates. And in the U.S., Chicago has been pretty good on the upside in the cycle. And the large California markets continue to be very, very strong. In the longer term, I'm a little concerned about the technology, sort of bubble and valuations and all that. And ultimately, that may have an impact on Bay area numbers not next year and probably the -- not that year after. But we've essentially taken a lot of chips off the table and that -- from that R&D type of product. And I don't think you will have much of an effect on the distribution space."

So that's what we're doing. Our funds are -- we are way over the percentage that we need to have in the funds, I mean like double or triple of what our percentage should be. And we're getting a lot of interest from our investors who are in the queues for investing in these funds to put their capital in and to invest. And we've gone to them and we said, ""Okay, we're prepared to sell down to accommodate your needs."" And by the way, we've also told the other investors, ""Look, if you want to sell down along with us, come on down because we've got plenty of people who want to buy in and this is a good time to rebalance your portfolio."" And 1 or 2 investors have taken advantage of that, but by and large, other people have not wanted to sell down and we never intended to have 40% in our funds. And the target was more around 15% or 20%, and we're not going to go all the way down to that level, certainly. But we're going to get back to a more normal allocation of our funds. I think there's some transactions that are locked and loaded that will -- that are based on fourth quarter valuations. So we know the values, we know the timing, we know the amounts. And that's why we feel so confident in our capital plan and not at all concerned about the things that we were asked about in terms of dispositions in the fourth quarter and all that. So we're watching these things on a real-time basis, and we have to adjust our disposition plans to balance the fund investments and that can continue to be a source of capital for us. I think in -- couple of quarters ago, we walked you through that there was about $3 billion of capital available because of our excess investment in our fund. So that is an effect of forward funding opportunity for anything that we may need capital for. And for the time being, we're really happy having our capital invested in that."

As you've heard me talk about, we have too much land to support our development, and that's partly a legacy issue from the last cycle. And we've got a challenge because as we monetize land in our development since value keeps going -- their value what remains keeps going up. So we've got a bit of a headwind in terms of getting our land down and you're just seeing the book value, actually. The market value is substantially higher than that. So we have a conscious decision to work down our land. In fact, what I'd like to see in our land be is to be under $1 billion, because I think it can support 2 or 3 years of development, with having that amount of land on our books. That means that we can unlock about $1 billion of capital from our land bank over some period of time. I hope it's sooner than later. But there's $1 billion of capital sitting there. If that were invested in income-producing properties, everything else being the same, that's another $60 million of earnings that are being wasted because they're parked in dead land. So that's another, what $0.12 a share, that would be really meaningful to our business. And our team is working hard to getting the land bank done. It takes time, but we'll get there."

330123,321595056,921104,"Prologis, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Prologis, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning. At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remained exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints s",701,"Thanks, Tracy, and good morning. At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remained exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints supply are creating favorable conditions around the world. Focusing on the top global and reginal markets has helped us outperform the broader market. 
Core FFO grew 19% year-over-year. Occupancy reached a record 96.9%, and rents increased 13%. We're 2 years into our 3-year strategic plan and have already exceeded all of our financial goals, a year ahead of plan. Core FFO, however, doesn't tell the whole story. While the key drivers of our operating performance on core FFO are occupancy, rent and fees, we also create value from our development and value-added conversions. 
The results of these activities materially add to our NAV. Last year, value creation totaled $700 million, representing an additional $1.30 per share of NAV. 
Industrial real estate market conditions are healthy in most of the world in spite of concerns about emerging market economies, including slower growth in China. In Europe, for example, where we've allocated significant capital over the last several years, value appreciation has been extremely robust. 
While several macroeconomic indicators tell a mixed story around the world, those most correlated with our business point to favorable business trends in 2015. These include: global consumption with flat growth in '16, at over 4%; global trade, up in '16 by about 3.5%; U.S. container imports, up in '16 by about 5.5%; and strong e-commerce with growth again in the double digits.
The best indicator for our business, however, is the health and outlook of our customers. Their space needs tell the story of global consumption. For many customers, that story is one of continued expansions. Demand continues to exceed supply. As we said on our last call, equilibrium in the U.S. will likely be reached in late 2016.
Globally, our share of in-place portfolio rents is 10% under market today, which will lead to continued NOI growth ahead of inflation as leases turnover. We're disciplined about managing risk in our spec development, with a focus on profitability, not volume. Unlike previous cycles, other developers and lenders in our sector also appear to be showing discipline.
As a result, a healthy supply/demand environment continues, now in its sixth year. Supply chain reconfiguration is a key long-term driver of our business. This is true for the full spectrum of our customer base, where growth is slowing, customers are investing in ways to squeeze more efficiency out of their supply chain. Even in a low-growth environment, our business can grow.
At the other end of the spectrum, the growth in the e-commerce continues to be a source of demand for industrial real estate. Online sales grew 15% in the U.S., while traditional retail grew only 2%. The allure for brick-and-mortar retailers to create or expand their e-commerce business will continue well into the future. To meet consumer demand for faster deliveries, this channel requires facilities that are closer to labor and population centers.
We speak regularly with our customers about their changing space needs. Good examples are Home Depot and Walmart. Once considered traditional retailers, they are well underway with major reconfigurations of their supply chain, designed to handle the rapidly changing e-commerce segment. 
Our existing building and development portfolio has accommodated our most sophisticated e-commerce customers' needs and has done so across the wide range of space configurations from the largest fulfillment centers in our master-planned parks, down to smaller last mile delivery centers in our infill buildings. We believe our business momentum will continue in 2016. This is due to steady market conditions and broad-based demand from other sectors, such as food and beverage, automotive and electronics.
The last several years, we worked to realign our portfolio and strengthen our capital structure. We had an outstanding 2015 and made significant progress on our priorities, finishing the year better positioned than ever. The result is a business that outperforms during improving macro conditions and can capitalize on opportunities in the downturn. Based on our customers input and the position of our portfolio, we have a positive outlook for 2016. Tom?"

We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.64 per share for the quarter and $2.23 per share for the year, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth q",1135,"Thanks, Hamid. We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.64 per share for the quarter and $2.23 per share for the year, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth quarter from our PELP venture. We exceeded the top end of our guidance, primarily due to operations and timing of capital deployment.
Starting with operations. Occupancy reached an all-time high of 96.9% and was above 95% in every region. Our share of GAAP rent change was 12.4%, driven by the U.S. at 18%. The KTR assets had performed ahead of our underwriting for both occupancy and rent change. KTR has been fully integrated in our portfolio and is included in the operating statistics I discussed. 
Our share of GAAP same-store NOI increased 6.6% in the quarter, driven by the U.S. at 8.7%. As we discussed last quarter, the negative impact of on GAAP -- on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger have fully burned off. This again had a positive impact of about 100 basis points on GAAP same-store. 
Moving to our share of capital deployment. We had an exceptional year and created significant value for our shareholders. We stabilized $1.6 billion of developments with an estimated margin of 33%. The initial yield on these stabilizations was 7.3% and the incremental cash return, excluding already owned land, was 9.2%. Dispositions and contributions totaled $2.5 billion at a 5.3% weighted average stabilized cap rate and included $166 million of value creation from value-added conversions.
Dispositions and contributions volume was about $400 million short of the midpoint of our guidance. We elected to split a few sales across multiple buyers to maximize proceeds, and deferred certain contributions to amass better scale, pushing this activity into the first half of 2016. We started $1.8 billion of development, with build-to-suits making up 44%. The starts will generate estimated value creation of $388 million and margin of 21%.
Turning to capital markets. We had an active quarter and closed the year with our lines of credit fully undrawn, and reduced the short-term loan associated with the KTR acquisition to $400 million. We're on track to pay off the remainder of the term loan by the end of the first half of 2016, if not sooner. Our leverage on a book base has dropped to 130 basis points to 38.4% at quarter end. 
Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, improved to 6x for the quarter. While leverage and debt-to-EBITDA are very important credit metrics, there are other factors, which demonstrate the strength of our balance sheet. The first is liquidity. We ended the year with over $2.8 billion of liquidity and only 12% of our debt maturing in the next 24 months. Maintaining significant liquidity at all times is a pillar of our balance sheet strategy, as it mitigates credit market disruptions and provides ready capital to be opportunistic. 
Second is our significant nominal EBITDA coverage. We have over $1.5 billion of annualized EBITDA in excess of our fixed charges, underpinned by more than $25 billion of unencumbered assets. The bottom line is our balance sheet is in great shape and we expect it to get even stronger in 2016. 
Let's switch to 2016 guidance. For operation, we expect our year-end occupancy to range between 96% and 97% and our share of GAAP same-store NOI growth at between 3.5% and 4.5%. Cash same-store NOI growth should be higher than GAAP in 2016. The split of our share of NOI by geography will be approximately 80% Americas, 15% Europe and 5% Asia. We expect our share development stabilizations to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, as stabilizations have increased meaningfully over the past 3 years and now approach our starts volume, continue to see significant annual NOI growth from our developments. 
For 2016, we expect FFO from development stabilizations of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. Related to FX, our 2016 earnings are very well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations as over 90% is already hedged. For net G&A, we're forecasting a range of $235 million to $245 million, essentially flat to last year at the midpoint, while managing more than $6 billion in assets. 
For strategic capital, we expect revenue without promotes to range between $180 million and $190 million. We have promote opportunities from 3 of our ventures in 2016, PTELF and PEPF II in the third quarter and USLV in the fourth quarter. We project net promotes to contribute between $0.17 and $0.19 per share to core FFO. The magnitude of these promotes is a testament to our strategic capital franchise as well as our strategy to allocate capital to Europe over the last 5 years. 
Over this period, we took advantage of a dislocation in asset prices in the market. Our European portfolio has consistently outperformed the market in terms of both occupancy and returns. 
Our capital deployment guidance is spelled out in our supplemental. At the midpoint of our net deployment, we will generate proceeds of about $400 million. Additionally, we have 2 other varied significant sources of cash in 2016.
First, we will receive $198 million in cash in the first quarter from our completion of the installment sale related to Facebook. And second, we redeemed a total of $400 million between our USLF and PTELF ventures, which we'll fund in the second quarter of 2016. This ownership rebalancing in these 2 open-ended funds is aligned with our long-term ownership targets and facilitates the deployment of substantial investment queues in these ventures. 
As a result, we expect to generate net deployment proceeds in excess of our capital needs of $1 billion in 2016 or $600 million after repayment of the last $400 million of the KTR term loan. 
Putting this altogether, we expect our 2016 core FFO to range between $2.50 and $2.60 per share, including promotes. This represents 14% year-over-year growth or an increase of $0.32 per share at the midpoint. We expect AFFO growth will exceed core FFO growth in 2016. 
If we assume a normalized annual net promote of $0.05 per share, our core FFO range for 2016 would be between $2.38 a share and $2.46 a share, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. In closing, we had an incredible year and enter 2016 with confidence though mindful of potential economic crosscurrents. We have a portfolio that has never been in better shape, a strong balance sheet and a plan that grows core FFO 14%, pays off the remaining KTR debt; self-funds all deployment; generates $1 billion of net deployment in excess for capital needs; maintains significant liquidity; and it provides flexibility and optionality to adjust to changes in market conditions.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

One, when you look at our coverage in 2015, our coverage with development gains is 69%; without development gains is 89%. For 2016, similar numbers would be with development gains of 65% roughly and without development gains of about 75%. So we have significant AFFO coverage in excess of our dividend. Now you had a question about how the dividend might be impacted, if it could be impacted by changes in development. So what -- so the first thing you need to think about -- and I'm assuming you're referring to capitalized overhead and capitalized interest. So the first thing you need to think about though is how are we capitalizing development. We're capitalizing development by self-funding, so we're selling assets and rolling those into development. And we're selling assets that are yielding, let's just call it 6%. And we're capping interest at a rate of roughly 3%. And when you look at our cap overhead, our capital overhead actually related to development, annually is about $47 million. And when you express that $47 million over development, it's about 3%. So if you think about -- if we slow down development, let's just take an extreme example. Let's just assume there's no development. So if we had development of $2 billion, we were going to sell $2 billion to fund that. The 6% we were earning on that development is going to stay in our income statement. The interest expense that we would've capped is going to stay in our income statement. The overhead that we were going to cap is going to stay on our income statement. And you know what? There's a 0 impact on our income statement, because all of that NOI that we would've used to fund that development, is going to stay on our books. So we're self-funding. So if the development slows down, no really impact -- no impact on our earnings."

And there is a lot of talk out there about what would the value of the portfolio be on a constant cap rate basis and the like. When you sell $8 billion from the lower tier of your portfolio, the mix has a very substantial impact on what cap rate is even in the steady environment on what's left in your portfolio. So we think the IRR at the end of the days is what matters, and those cap rates are higher because the growth rates are lower. And we feel really good about our capital allocation decisions. Just think about that capital we allocated to Europe a couple of years ago. How did we fund that? We funded that by selling some nonstrategic assets in Europe. At the time, people thought we were crazy. We were selling assets in the U.S. in the mid 6s and low 7s, and we were buying assets in Europe in the low 8s. And those assets that we bought in the low 8s are now in the high 5s and low 6s.

I just wanted to clarify that. Secondly, I would say, we have pretty good visibility into the valuations because we appraise the portfolio, particularly the deals that are in the ventures on a quarterly basis. And we know what the carrying values are in the fourth quarter, and we put some sensitivity around that at scenarios that include cap rate expansion, flat cap rates, reducing cap rates.

So, so far, so good, but we're really watching those 2 markets probably more than any others in the U.S. I would say going over to Europe, Paris is a bit soft and it's not really a supply problem, it's more of a demand problem. And I think some of it has to do with some of this heritage stuff that went on last quarter. But I don't know if France has generally been a little bit slower. The place that's been surprisingly strong in Europe for us, has been Spain. Spain's really done a turnaround and I would say, it's done extremely well.

In the longer term, I'm a little concerned about the technology, sort of, bubble and valuations and all that. And ultimately, that may have an impact on Bay area numbers not next year and probably the -- not that year after. But we've essentially taken a lot of chips off the table and that -- from that R&D type of product. And I don't think you will have much of an effect on the distribution space."

So that's what we're doing. Our funds are -- we are way over the percentage that we need to have in the funds, I mean like double or triple of what our percentage should be. And we're getting a lot of interest from our investors who are in the queues for investing in these funds to put their capital in and to invest. And we've gone to them and we said, ""Okay, we're prepared to sell down to accommodate your needs."" And by the way, we've also told the other investors, ""Look, if you want to sell down along with us, come on down because we've got plenty of people who want to buy in and this is a good time to rebalance your portfolio."" And 1 or 2 investors have taken advantage of that, but by and large, other people have not wanted to sell down and we never intended to have 40% in our funds. And the target was more around 15% or 20%, and we're not going to go all the way down to that level, certainly. But we're going to get back to a more normal allocation of our funds. I think there's some transactions that are locked and loaded that will -- that are based on fourth quarter valuations. So we know the values, we know the timing, we know the amounts. And that's why we feel so confident in our capital plan and not at all concerned about the things that we were asked about in terms of dispositions in the fourth quarter and all that. So we're watching these things on a real-time basis, and we have to adjust our disposition plans to balance the fund investments and that can continue to be a source of capital for us. I think in -- couple of quarters ago, we walked you through it, there was about $3 billion of capital available because of our excess investment in our fund. So that is, in effect, a forward funding opportunity for anything that we may need capital for. And for the time being, we're really happy having our capital invested in that."

As you've heard me talk about, we have too much land to support our development, and that's partly a legacy issue from the last cycle.

So we've got a bit of a headwind in terms of getting our land down and you're just seeing the book value, actually. The market value is substantially higher than that. So we have a conscious decision to work down our land. In fact, what I'd like to see in our land be is to be under $1 billion, because I think it can support 2 or 3 years of development, with having that amount of land on our books. That means that we can unlock about $1 billion of capital from our land bank over some period of time. I hope it's sooner than later. But there's $1 billion of capital sitting there. If that were invested in income-producing properties, everything else being the same, that's another $60 million of earnings that are being wasted because they're parked in dead land. So that's another, what $0.12 a share, that would be really meaningful to our business. And our team is working hard to getting the land bank done. It takes time, but we'll get there."

330123,321595056,921255,"Prologis, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Prologis, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning. At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remained exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints s",701,"Thanks, Tracy, and good morning. At Prologis, 2015 was a banner year. Business remained exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year that exceeded expectations in virtually all aspects of the business. Broad-based demand and restraints supply are creating favorable conditions around the world. Focusing on the top global and regional markets has helped us outperform the broader market. 
Core FFO grew 19% year-over-year. Occupancy reached a record 96.9%, and rents increased 13%. We're 2 years into our 3-year strategic plan and have already exceeded all of our financial goals, a year ahead of plan. Core FFO, however, doesn't tell the whole story. While the key drivers of our operating performance on core FFO are occupancy, rent and fees, we also create value from our development and value-added conversions. 
The results of these activities materially add to our NAV. Last year, value creation totaled $700 million, representing an additional $1.30 per share of NAV. 
Industrial real estate market conditions are healthy in most of the world in spite of concerns about emerging market economies, including slower growth in China. In Europe, for example, where we've allocated significant capital over the last several years, value appreciation has been extremely robust. 
While several macroeconomic indicators tell a mixed story around the world, those most correlated with our business point to favorable business trends in 2015. These include: global consumption with flat growth in '16, at over 4%; global trade, up in '16 by about 3.5%; U.S. container imports, up in '16 by about 5.5%; and strong e-commerce with growth again in the double digits.
The best indicator for our business, however, is the health and outlook of our customers. Their space needs tell the story of global consumption. For many customers, that story is one of continued expansions. Demand continues to exceed supply. As we said on our last call, equilibrium in the U.S. will likely be reached in late 2016.
Globally, our share of in-place portfolio rents is 10% under market today, which will lead to continued NOI growth ahead of inflation as leases turnover. We're disciplined about managing risk in our spec development, with a focus on profitability, not volume. Unlike previous cycles, other developers and lenders in our sector also appear to be showing discipline.
As a result, a healthy supply/demand environment continues, now in its sixth year. Supply chain reconfiguration is a key long-term driver of our business. This is true for the full spectrum of our customer base, where growth is slowing, customers are investing in ways to squeeze more efficiency out of their supply chain. Even in a low-growth environment, our business can grow.
At the other end of the spectrum, the growth in the e-commerce continues to be a source of demand for industrial real estate. Online sales grew 15% in the U.S., while traditional retail grew only 2%. The allure for brick-and-mortar retailers to create or expand their e-commerce business will continue well into the future. To meet consumer demand for faster deliveries, this channel requires facilities that are closer to labor and population centers.
We speak regularly with our customers about their changing space needs. Good examples are Home Depot and Walmart. Once considered traditional retailers, they are well underway with major reconfigurations of their supply chain, designed to handle the rapidly changing e-commerce segment. 
Our existing building and development portfolio has accommodated our most sophisticated e-commerce customers' needs and has done so across the wide range of space configurations from the largest fulfillment centers in our master-planned parks, down to smaller last mile delivery centers in our infill buildings. We believe our business momentum will continue in 2016. This is due to steady market conditions and broad-based demand from other sectors, such as food and beverage, automotive and electronics.
The last several years, we worked to realign our portfolio and strengthen our capital structure. We had an outstanding 2015 and made significant progress on our priorities, finishing the year better positioned than ever. The result is a business that outperforms during improving macro conditions and can capitalize on opportunities in the downturn. Based on our customers input and the position of our portfolio, we have a positive outlook for 2016. Tom?"

We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.64 per share for the quarter and $2.23 per share for the year, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth q",1135,"Thanks, Hamid. We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.64 per share for the quarter and $2.23 per share for the year, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This includes $0.05 of net promote income we earned in the fourth quarter from our PELP venture. We exceeded the top end of our guidance, primarily due to operations and timing of capital deployment.
Starting with operations. Occupancy reached an all-time high of 96.9% and was above 95% in every region. Our share of GAAP rent change was 12.4%, driven by the U.S. at 18%. The KTR assets had performed ahead of our underwriting for both occupancy and rent change. KTR has been fully integrated in our portfolio and is included in the operating statistics I discussed. 
Our share of GAAP same-store NOI increased 6.6% in the quarter, driven by the U.S. at 8.7%. As we discussed last quarter, the negative impact of on GAAP -- on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger have fully burned off. This again had a positive impact of about 100 basis points on GAAP same-store. 
Moving to our share of capital deployment. We had an exceptional year and created significant value for our shareholders. We stabilized $1.6 billion of developments with an estimated margin of 33%. The initial yield on these stabilizations was 7.3% and the incremental cash return, excluding already owned land, was 9.2%. Dispositions and contributions totaled $2.5 billion at a 5.3% weighted average stabilized cap rate and included $166 million of value creation from value-added conversions.
Dispositions and contributions volume was about $400 million short of the midpoint of our guidance. We elected to split a few sales across multiple buyers to maximize proceeds, and deferred certain contributions to amass better scale, pushing this activity into the first half of 2016. We started $1.8 billion of development, with build-to-suits making up 44%. The starts will generate estimated value creation of $388 million and margin of 21%.
Turning to capital markets. We had an active quarter and closed the year with our lines of credit fully undrawn, and reduced the short-term loan associated with the KTR acquisition to $400 million. We're on track to pay off the remainder of the term loan by the end of the first half of 2016, if not sooner. Our leverage on a book base has dropped to 130 basis points to 38.4% at quarter end. 
Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, improved to 6x for the quarter. While leverage and debt-to-EBITDA are very important credit metrics, there are other factors, which demonstrate the strength of our balance sheet. The first is liquidity. We ended the year with over $2.8 billion of liquidity and only 12% of our debt maturing in the next 24 months. Maintaining significant liquidity at all times is a pillar of our balance sheet strategy, as it mitigates credit market disruptions and provides ready capital to be opportunistic. 
Second is our significant nominal EBITDA coverage. We have over $1.5 billion of annualized EBITDA in excess of our fixed charges, underpinned by more than $25 billion of unencumbered assets. The bottom line is our balance sheet is in great shape and we expect it to get even stronger in 2016. 
Let's switch to 2016 guidance. For operation, we expect our year-end occupancy to range between 96% and 97% and our share of GAAP same-store NOI growth at between 3.5% and 4.5%. Cash same-store NOI growth should be higher than GAAP in 2016. The split of our share of NOI by geography will be approximately 80% Americas, 15% Europe and 5% Asia. We expect our share development stabilizations to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, as stabilizations have increased meaningfully over the past 3 years and now approach our starts volume, continue to see significant annual NOI growth from our developments. 
For 2016, we expect FFO from development stabilizations of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. Related to FX, our 2016 earnings are very well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations as over 90% is already hedged. For net G&A, we're forecasting a range of $235 million to $245 million, essentially flat to last year at the midpoint, while managing more than $6 billion in assets. 
For strategic capital, we expect revenue without promotes to range between $180 million and $190 million. We have promote opportunities from 3 of our ventures in 2016, PTELF and PEPF II in the third quarter and USLV in the fourth quarter. We project net promotes to contribute between $0.17 and $0.19 per share to core FFO. The magnitude of these promotes is a testament to our strategic capital franchise as well as our strategy to allocate capital to Europe over the last 5 years. 
Over this period, we took advantage of a dislocation in asset prices in the market. Our European portfolio has consistently outperformed the market in terms of both occupancy and returns. 
Our capital deployment guidance is spelled out in our supplemental. At the midpoint of our net deployment, we will generate proceeds of about $400 million. Additionally, we have 2 other varied significant sources of cash in 2016.
First, we will receive $198 million in cash in the first quarter from our completion of the installment sale related to Facebook. And second, we redeemed a total of $400 million between our USLF and PTELF ventures, which we'll fund in the second quarter of 2016. This ownership rebalancing in these 2 open-ended funds is aligned with our long-term ownership targets and facilitates the deployment of substantial investment queues in these ventures. 
As a result, we expect to generate net deployment proceeds in excess of our capital needs of $1 billion in 2016 or $600 million after repayment of the last $400 million of the KTR term loan. 
Putting this altogether, we expect our 2016 core FFO to range between $2.50 and $2.60 per share, including promotes. This represents 14% year-over-year growth or an increase of $0.32 per share at the midpoint. We expect AFFO growth will exceed core FFO growth in 2016. 
If we assume a normalized annual net promote of $0.05 per share, our core FFO range for 2016 would be between $2.38 a share and $2.46 a share, an increase of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. In closing, we had an incredible year and enter 2016 with confidence though mindful of potential economic crosscurrents. We have a portfolio that has never been in better shape, a strong balance sheet and a plan that grows core FFO 14%, pays off the remaining KTR debt; self-funds all deployment; generates $1 billion of net deployment in excess for capital needs; maintains significant liquidity; and it provides flexibility and optionality to adjust to changes in market conditions.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

One, when you look at our coverage in 2015, our coverage with development gains is 69%; without development gains is 89%. For 2016, similar numbers would be with development gains of 65% roughly and without development gains of about 75%. So we have significant AFFO coverage in excess of our dividend. Now you had a question about how the dividend might be impacted, if it could be impacted by changes in development. So what -- so the first thing you need to think about -- and I'm assuming you're referring to capitalized overhead and capitalized interest. So the first thing you need to think about though is how are we capitalizing development. We're capitalizing development by self-funding, so we're selling assets and rolling those into development. And we're selling assets that are yielding, let's just call it 6%. And we're capping interest at a rate of roughly 3%. And when you look at our cap overhead, our capital overhead actually related to development, annually is about $47 million. And when you express that $47 million over development, it's about 3%. So if you think about -- if we slow down development, let's just take an extreme example. Let's just assume there's no development. So if we had development of $2 billion, we were going to sell $2 billion to fund that. The 6% we were earning on that development is going to stay in our income statement. The interest expense that we would've capped is going to stay in our income statement. The overhead that we were going to cap is going to stay on our income statement. And you know what? There's a 0 impact on our income statement, because all of that NOI that we would've used to fund that development, is going to stay on our books. So we're self-funding. So if the development slows down, no really impact -- no impact on our earnings."

So it was really just a shift of timing to the end of the year, a point in time and we elected to shift some activity into '16 for very good economic reasons. But we feel great about where we are. We're ahead of schedule from a KTR standpoint. I talked -- we talked about that funding, paying off the remaining $400 million by the end of the first half of the year. I think it's going to be April, to be very specific, when you look at all of the funding that we have in place that is certain to close."

So if anything, if we're going to do our plan again, I would say, we would be slightly more optimistic about leasing because the Europe is on balance."

And I think you know that we've been selling from the nonstrategic end of the spectrum. So you would expect those cap rates to be higher than our portfolio. And there is a lot of talk out there about what would the value of the portfolio be on a constant cap rate basis and the like. When you sell $8 billion from the lower tier of your portfolio, the mix has a very substantial impact on what cap rate is even in the steady environment on what's left in your portfolio. So we think the IRR at the end of the days is what matters, and those cap rates are higher because the growth rates are lower. And we feel really good about our capital allocation decisions. Just think about that capital we allocated to Europe a couple of years ago. How did we fund that? We funded that by selling some nonstrategic assets in Europe. At the time, people thought we were crazy. We were selling assets in the U.S. in the mid 6s and low 7s, and we were buying assets in Europe in the low 8s. And those assets that we bought in the low 8s are now in the high 5s and low 6s.

I just wanted to clarify that. Secondly, I would say, we have pretty good visibility into the valuations because we appraise the portfolio, particularly the deals that are in the ventures on a quarterly basis. And we know what the carrying values are in the fourth quarter, and we put some sensitivity around that at scenarios that include cap rate expansion, flat cap rates, reducing cap rates.

So, so far, so good, but we're really watching those 2 markets probably more than any others in the U.S. I would say going over to Europe, Paris is a bit soft and it's not really a supply problem, it's more of a demand problem. And I think some of it has to do with some of this heritage stuff that went on last quarter. But I don't know if France has generally been a little bit slower. The place that's been surprisingly strong in Europe for us, has been Spain. Spain's really done a turnaround and I would say, it's done extremely well. The U.K. was early, in Europe -- and we thought it got a little bit ahead of itself and it may go the other way or soften. It hasn't, it continues to be pretty strong in terms of cap rates. And in the U.S., Chicago has been pretty good on the upside in the cycle. And the large California markets continue to be very, very strong. In the longer term, I'm a little concerned about the technology, sort of, bubble and valuations and all that. And ultimately, that may have an impact on Bay area numbers not next year and probably the -- not that year after.

And then the second question is, hopefully, you can touch upon the land sale this quarter. It seems like land, as a percent of your total operating portfolio, has decreased pretty meaningfully."

As you've heard me talk about, we have too much land to support our development, and that's partly a legacy issue from the last cycle. And we've got a challenge because as we monetize land in our development since value keeps going -- their value what remains keeps going up. So we've got a bit of a headwind in terms of getting our land down and you're just seeing the book value, actually. The market value is substantially higher than that. So we have a conscious decision to work down our land. In fact, what I'd like to see in our land be is to be under $1 billion, because I think it can support 2 or 3 years of development, with having that amount of land on our books. That means that we can unlock about $1 billion of capital from our land bank over some period of time. I hope it's sooner than later. But there's $1 billion of capital sitting there. If that were invested in income-producing properties, everything else being the same, that's another $60 million of earnings that are being wasted because they're parked in dead land. So that's another, what $0.12 a share, that would be really meaningful to our business. And our team is working hard to getting the land bank done. It takes time, but we'll get there."

But because of obviously cap rate compression and extraordinary rental growth in the last couple of years, promotes for this coming cycle, if values hold up, are going to be really, really high. But they are not indicative of sustainable levels of promotes for sure. But there is a -- I don't know, there's a $0.05 or $0.06 level of promote that we feel is pretty sustainable and growing over time, even in a normalized market environment. And for the foreseeable future, we're going to exceed that and there may be some years we'll fall short of that, like in '09, '10 and '11. But I think those kinds of numbers are repeatable."

The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the new year.

The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the new year. We posted record first quarter numbers on rent change, which was stronger than expected at over 20% and core FFO, which grew 24% year-over-year. At this point in the cycle, we're pushing rent growth over occupancy. Nevertheless, occupancy is still very high at over 96%. These and other metrics, which Tom will discuss in a moment, point to continued growth ahead for Prologis. 
I'd like to take a moment to elaborate on how and where we make our money. Many of you already know this, but I believe it's worth repeating. We make over 90% of our core FFO by collecting rents. The rest is generated by fees and promotes from our strategic capital business. Together, rents and fees represent a stable cash flow created from our operating portfolio. Separately, the value creation from our development business, including value-added conversions, propels our future earnings growth. So our operating and development activities address how we make money. 
Now as to where we make our money when collecting rents, 72% is in the U.S. and 28% comes from abroad, roughly 90% of our net equity is in US dollar. Many ask us why we're global. In short, we're global because our customers are global. And so we've organized our business to capitalize on this unique aspect of our sector. About 2/3 of our development value creation, fees and promotes are generated outside the U.S. 
As on aside, these benefits actually cover more than 100% of our global overhead. I view Prologis as an owner-operator in the U.S. and a fund manager and developer in the U.S. and Asia. We have minimal exposure to emerging economies. Market conditions remain favorable in the world's most vibrant centers of commerce. In these strategic locations, demand was solid with supply still very disciplined. These business conditions have persisted for several years now. While we anticipated supply, demand reaching equilibrium this year, we see obstacles on the road ahead that could disrupt that balance. 
In the U.S. quality properties remain scarce, which is leading to strong rent growth and high occupancies. We'll continue to signal watchlist markets and this quarter, we have no new markets to call out. In Europe and Asia, rents are up modestly from last quarter, balanced by slightly lower occupancies. In Mexico, rents are up slightly and occupancy is flat. While in Brazil, rents are down modestly but occupancy is at 100%. The key drivers of our business, consumption and e-commerce, continue to grow faster than underlying economies. We have every reason to expect these trends to continue into the future. 
KTR is all paid off. Our funding activities, specifically the short-term loan associated with that deal, concluded less than one year after it was announced and ahead of schedule. With the transaction paid in full and the portfolio integrated, today's call is probably the last time you'll hear us talk about KTR. We have capacity to fund more than 5 years of capital deployment. At our current run rate, our total annual funding requirement is $600 million. We expect to fund this through the rebalancing of our co-investment ventures, reducing our land bank and reducing our nonstrategic assets. These onetime sources totaled more than $3.5 billion and give us the ability to fund more than 5 years of met deployment activity. 
We'll further simplify our business over time. Over the last several years, we made great strides in optimizing our business to put us on a path for long-term sustained earnings growth. In addition, look for us to continue streamline our business through the ongoing realignment of our portfolio, further G&A efficiencies, land bank optimization and reduced leverage. 
Now let me turn it over to Tom for further comments."
330123,329631933,959467,"Prologis, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Prologis, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM. Starting with operations. Occupancy in the U.S. was",946,"Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM. Starting with operations. Occupancy in the U.S. was 96.6% at quarter end and 95.4% outside the U.S. Leasing volume for the quarter was a record at 46 million square feet. 
Just a quick reminder that my comments as I go through the rest of the operating and capital deployment activity will focus on our share. GAAP rent change on rollover was an all-time high of 20.1% led by the U.S. at 27.2% and 4% outside the U.S. GAAP same-store NOI increased 7.4% positive across all major geographies and driven by the U.S. at 9.6%. There are 2 items I want to highlight. 
First, as we previously discussed, the negative impact on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger burned off in the second quarter of 2015. As a result, this had a positive noncash impact of about 170 basis points on GAAP same-store growth in the third quarter. 
Second, expense timing drove an approximate 70 basis points positive impact. After adjusting for these 2 items, GAAP same-store growth was 5%, which was attributable to the strong rental increases and year-over-year occupancy gains. Strategic capital fees were $50 million for the quarter with a majority coming from our international joint ventures. Capital deployment activity is progressing as planned. There are 2 items I would like to highlight this quarter. 
First, that our stabilization had an estimated margin of 27%; and second, that build-to-suits comprised 42% of our development starts. Turning to Capital Markets. Our leverage on a book basis was 38.1% at quarter-end and 33.9% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, improved to 5.6x. 
As Hamid mentioned, we fully repaid the $400 million term loan associated with the KTR acquisition and liquidity remains strong. Last quarter -- this week, we recast our Global Line of Credit, lowering our spread by 10 basis points and increasing the capacity by $640 million. As a result, our total line capacity is now $3.4 billion, further enhancing our current significant liquidity levels. We expect to see further improvement in our debt metrics throughout the remainder of the year as our venture rebalancings were completed this month and the pace of dispositions accelerate. 
The continued strengthening of our balance sheet was acknowledged this quarter by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, updated our credit outlook positive. We believe we're on the doorstep of an A rating. Before discussing guidelines, I want to highlight enhancements to our earnings supplemental this quarter. The changes are based on the feedback we received from investors and analysts as well as to better align our disclosure with how we think about and how we run the company. As part of this, we've revisited the classification of certain personnel costs at our income statement, which had the effect of increasing expenses related to our strategic capital business by $17 million on an annualized basis and reducing G&A by the same amount. 
There is no bottom line impact on net income or core FFO. For context, we completed the significant volume of co-investment activity over the past 5 years and almost doubled our third-party AUM. With this increase, we now have more full-time employees dedicated to our strategic capital business. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. We're maintaining guidance for most of our operating metrics, capital deployment and strategic capital revenues, all of which you can see on Page 6 of our supplemental. On same-store NOI, we are increasing the bottom end and narrowing the range to between 4% and 4.5% with a bias towards the upper half of this range. For net G&A, we are lowering the range to between $218 million and $228 million to reflect the reclassification I just mentioned. 
Related to FX. Our 2016 earnings remains well insulated from foreign currency at fluctuations as over 95% are hedged. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital in 2016. This consists of $400 million in net deployment proceeds, $198 million of cash that we already received from the completion of the Facebook installment sale and $400 million from the ownership rebalancing in our U.S. and hotel ventures, which we will receive in a few weeks.
Further, we like what we are seeing in the disposition market and are likely to increase our volume. So while operating conditions are stronger than we expected, we are not increasing our core FFO given the potential dilution from increased dispositions. Therefore, we are maintaining our 2016 core FFO kind of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share. This includes $0.17 to $0.19 per share of promotes, which will recognize in the second half of this year. If we assume normalized annual net promote of $0.05 per share, our core FFO for 2016 would range from between $2.38 to $2.46 per share. 
Core FFO will not be evenly distributed for the balance of the year given the timing of our asset sales and venture rebalancing. As a result, we expect core FFO to be $0.03 or $0.04 lower in the second quarter, followed by an acceleration in the back half of the year from promote income. 
In closing, we are off to a really good start. Our focus for the rest of the year -- 2016 is simply about capturing the significant spreads between in-place and market rents, generating profitable returns by putting our land back to work and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. 
With that I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

And there are lots of explanations for it. But the most credible one I think is the one that sales shift to commerce, there are more skews and there's a need to keep more inventory around. And as a result, there may be a secular shift. If that's the case, that's an unexpected windfall to demand for industrial space. We have not built our business with that expectation. But that will be a nice surprise if it happens and if it has legs forever. So too soon to tell for sure, but I think the early signs are pretty good."

I can tell you, it's not worth the 15 or 20 multiple that people were valuing it at 2007 that's for sure. But it's worth something. It's worth at least a homebuilder. I think it's worth $3 or $5 a share pretty easily if you look at it as a homebuilder. So you add up all of that stuff, the number is around high 40s, low 50s kind of -- for the way I look at our NAV.

The pace of land value growth has moderated. The other thing I would point out is that yes, our land bank is about $1.5 billion book value, but the market value that in our view of again, based on pretty robust analysis is approaching to may be in the low $2 billion range. So in terms of what we can work our land bank down is not $0.5 billion down to $1 billion, it's like $1 billion down to $1 billion in terms of value because the market value land is what we were targeting for.

Going forward for the remainder of the year, I wouldn't expect really any meaningful change in operating expenses from this run rate in any meaningful way."

And Pennsylvania is sort of a combination of a spike in supply and demand tailing off. But I wouldn't draw any conclusions, Erik, about the specific adjustments and vacancy in those markets. I don't think that's going to continue for a long time, I think in both cases, we're going to end up in the sort of mid-90s. But let me say a couple of other things about both of them. So Houston has been on our watch list. Vacancy was up a little bit over the quarter and it has 8 million of square feet of construction. We're defensive there and I think we've been saying that for a while. While the macro headwinds, obviously persists, we're almost 96% leased. The pipe is 50% pre-leased and there's still a 6% vacancy rate in Houston. And Houston isn't creating a lot of jobs, but it's net positive not negative at this point in time. And then in terms of Pennsylvania, probably we're a little more cautious in terms of Pennsylvania at this point in time. To your point on e-commerce trends. Erik, I -- we don't see any new trends coming out of this prior season. I think that everybody participating in this space, it's still -- that's really trying to figure out the supply chain both still the last mile, which everybody is talking about these days all the way to the origin of the product because different participants handle it differently.

So those 2 things have made demand for our product better than they would have been based on the overall economic numbers.

So we'll be at somewhere around market vacancy, about 5.8%, which is nearing sort of U.S. level, so we expect Europe to perform well on a go-forward basis. And then in Asia, the markets there I think are performing well. Japan is sitting there at about 96.3% occupied, and we're seeing good net absorption. So Japan is performing well. China is a business that I think some have concern of. It's a small business for us but one that again is performing pretty well. We're about 92% occupied in our overall portfolio, but if you look at the supplemental, you'll see that there is a restock, occupy spread of about 200 basis points so you should expect occupancies in China to trend up the other comment that I'd make about China is that we've done about 2 million square feet of development leasing in this quarter, which is about 30% of the total leasing for the quarter for the company.

So if you think of in yen and in euro, and only 25% of our assets are. So when the yen and the euro increased against that liability, that debt, that increase took our debt levels up in U.S. dollar terms by about $300 million. But we didn't have the same $300 million increase in our denominator because only 25% of our assets are in euro and in yen. So there's the denominator effect and that affected leverage by about 70 basis points this quarter. So you really economically we add about 100 basis points decline this quarter, a little over actually. But that's FX noise. On your point about deployment proceeds for the rest of the year and how we're going to use that $1 billion of cash, we're going to look at our debt stack and we're going to determine if there is debt where economically or frictionless pay that off. We do have a multicurrency term loan that's out there that matures in a couple of years that would fit that bill. We always look at bond maturities to see if there's economically, if it makes sense to do that and we'll sit on cash.

It's a pretty dramatic increase, so that's what drives the numbers. But the same-store, let me give you some comment on what we see going through the year. So this is driven by the Americas, and partly because of the health of the market and in part because of the structure of our leases. But we're just under 24% in the quarter.

The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the new year.

The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the new year. We posted record first quarter numbers on rent change, which was stronger than expected at over 20% and core FFO, which grew 24% year-over-year. At this point in the cycle, we're pushing rent growth over occupancy. Nevertheless, occupancy is still very high at over 96%. These and other metrics, which Tom will discuss in a moment, point to continued growth ahead for Prologis. 
I'd like to take a moment to elaborate on how and where we make our money. Many of you already know this, but I believe it's worth repeating. We make over 90% of our core FFO by collecting rent. The rest is generated by fees and promotes from our strategic capital business. Together, rents and fees represent a stable cash flow created from our operating portfolio. Separately, the value creation from our development business, including value-added conversions, propels our future earnings growth. So our operating and development activities address how we make money. 
Now as to where we make our money, when collecting rents, 72% is in the U.S. and 28% comes from abroad. Roughly, 90% of our net equity is in US dollars. Many ask us why we're global. In short, we're global because our customers are global. And so we've organized our business to capitalize on this unique aspect of our sector. About 2/3 of our development value creation, fees and promotes are generated outside the U.S. 
As an aside, these benefits actually cover more than 100% of our global overhead. I view Prologis as an owner-operator in the U.S. and a fund manager and developer in Europe and Asia. We have minimal exposure to emerging economies. Market conditions remain favorable in the world's most vibrant centers of commerce. In these strategic locations, demand was solid with supply still very disciplined. These business conditions have persisted for several years now. While we anticipate supply/demand reaching equilibrium this year, we see few obstacles on the road ahead that could disrupt that balance.
In the U.S., quality properties remain scarce, which is leading to strong rent growth and high occupancies. We'll continue to signal watch-list markets. In this quarter, we have no new markets to call out. In Europe and Asia, rents are up modestly from last quarter, balanced by slightly lower occupancies. In Mexico, rents are up slightly and occupancy is flat. While in Brazil, rents are down modestly, but occupancy is at 100%. The key drivers of our business, consumption and e-commerce, continue to grow faster than underlying economies. We have every reason to expect these trends to continue into the future. 
KTR is all paid off. Our funding activities, specifically the short-term loan associated with that deal, concluded less than 1 year after it was announced and ahead of schedule. With the transaction paid in full and the portfolio integrated, today's call is probably the last time you'll hear us talk about KTR. We have capacity to fund more than 5 years of capital deployment. At our current run rate, our total annual funding requirement is $600 million. We expect to fund this through the rebalancing of our co-investment ventures, reducing our land bank and selling our remaining nonstrategic assets. These onetime sources totaled more than $3.5 billion and give us the ability to fund more than 5 years of net deployment activity. 
We'll further simplify our business over time. Over the last several years, we made great strides in optimizing our business to put us on a path for long term sustained earnings growth. In addition, look for us to continue streamline our business through the ongoing realignment of our portfolio, further G&A efficiencies, land bank optimization and reduced leverage. 
Now let me turn it over to Tom for further comments."
330123,329631933,959523,"Prologis, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Prologis, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM. Starting with operations. Occupancy in the U.S. was",946,"Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM. Starting with operations. Occupancy in the U.S. was 96.6% at quarter end and 95.4% outside the U.S. Leasing volume for the quarter was a record at 46 million square feet. 
Just a quick reminder that my comments, as I go through the rest of the operating and capital deployment activity, will focus on our share. GAAP rent change on rollover was an all-time high of 20.1%, led by the U.S. at 27.2% and 4% outside the U.S. GAAP same-store NOI increased 7.4%, positive across all major geographies and driven by the U.S. at 9.6%. There are 2 items I want to highlight. 
First, as we previously discussed, the negative impact on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger burned off in the second quarter of 2015. As a result, this had a positive noncash impact of about 170 basis points on GAAP same-store growth in the quarter. 
Second, expense timing drove an approximate 70 basis points positive impact. After adjusting for these 2 items, GAAP same-store growth was 5%, which is attributable to the strong rental increases and year-over-year occupancy gains. Strategic capital fees were $50 million for the quarter, with a majority coming from our international ventures. Capital deployment activity is progressing as planned. There are 2 items I would like to highlight this quarter. 
First, that our stabilizations had an estimated margin of 27%; and second, that build-to-suits comprised 42% of our development starts. Turning to capital markets. Our leverage on a book basis was 38.1% at quarter end and 33.9% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, improved to 5.6x. 
As Hamid mentioned, we fully repaid the $400 million term loan associated with the KTR acquisition and liquidity remained strong. Last quarter -- I'm sorry, this week, we recast our Global Line of Credit, lowering our spread by 10 basis points and increasing the capacity by $640 million. As a result, our total line capacity is now $3.4 billion, further enhancing our current significant liquidity levels. We expect to see further improvement in our debt metrics throughout the remainder of the year as our venture rebalancings were completed this month and the pace of dispositions accelerate. 
The continued strengthening of our balance sheet was acknowledged this quarter by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, upgraded our credit outlook to positive. We believe we are on the doorstep of an A rating. Before discussing guidance, I wanted to highlight the enhancements to our earnings supplemental this quarter. The changes are based on the feedback we received from investors and analysts as well as to better align our disclosure with how we think about and how we run the company. As part of this, we've revisited the classification of certain personnel costs in our income statement, which had the effect of increasing expenses related to our strategic capital business by $17 million on an annual basis and reducing G&A by the same amount. 
There is no bottom line impact on net income or core FFO. For context, we completed a significant volume of co-investment activity over the past 5 years and almost doubled our third-party AUM. With this increase, we now have more full-time employees dedicated to our strategic capital business. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. We're maintaining guidance for most of our operating metrics, capital deployment and strategic capital revenues, all of which you can see on Page 6 of our supplemental. On same-store NOI, we are increasing the bottom end and narrowing the range to between 4% and 4.5%, with a bias towards the upper half of this range. For net G&A, we are lowering the range to between $218 million and $228 million to reflect the reclassification I just mentioned. 
Related to FX. Our 2016 earnings remain well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations as over 95% are hedged. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs in 2016. This consist a $400 million in net deployment proceeds, $198 million of cash that we already received from the completion of the Facebook installment sale and $400 million from the ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures, which we will receive in a few weeks.
Further, we like what we are seeing in the disposition market and are likely to increase our volume. So while operating conditions are stronger than we expected, we are not increasing our core FFO given the potential dilution from increased dispositions. Therefore, we are maintaining our 2016 core FFO guidance between $2.50 and $2.60 per share. This includes $0.17 to $0.19 per share of promotes, which will recognize in the second half of this year. If we assume normalized annual net promotes of $0.05 per share, our core FFO for 2016 would range between $2.38 to $2.46 per share. 
Core FFO will not be evenly distributed for the balance of the year, given the timing of our asset sales and venture rebalancing. As a result, we expect core FFO to be $0.03 or $0.04 lower in the second quarter, followed by an acceleration in the back half of the year from promote income. 
In closing, we are off to a really good start. Our focus for the rest of the 2016 is simply about capturing the significant spreads between in-place and market rents, generating profitable returns by putting our land bank to work and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

And there are lots of explanations for it. But the most credible one I think is the one that has more sales shift to e-commerce, there are more skews and there's a need to keep more inventory around. And as a result, there may be a secular shift. If that's the case, that's unexpected windfall to demand for industrial space. We have not built our business with that expectation. But that will be a nice surprise if it happens and if it has legs forever. So too soon to tell for sure, but I think the early signs are really good."

I can tell you, it's not worth the 15 or 20 multiple that people were valuing it at 2007, that's for sure. But it's worth something. It's worth at least a homebuilder.

The pace of land value growth has moderated. The other thing I would point out is that, yes, our land bank is about $1.5 billion for book value, but the market value of that, in our view, again, based on pretty robust analysis is approaching to may be in the low $2 billion range. So in terms of what we can work our land bank down is not $0.5 billion down to $1 billion, it's like $1 billion down to $1 billion in terms of market value because the market value land is what we were targeting for. So we've got quite a bit of liquidity that could come out of the land bank to add to that $3.5 billion that we've talked about."

And Pennsylvania is sort of a combination of a spike in supply and demand tailing off. But I wouldn't draw any conclusions, Eric, about the specific adjustments and vacancy in those markets. I don't think that's going to continue for a long time. I think in both cases, we're going to end up in the sort of mid-90s. But let me say a couple of other things about both of them. So Houston has been on our watch list. Vacancy was up a little bit over the quarter and it has 8 million square feet on construction. We're defensive there and I think we've been saying that for a while. While the macro headwind obviously persists, we're almost 96% leased. The pipe is 50% preleased and there's still a 6% vacancy rate in Houston. And Houston isn't creating a lot of jobs, but it's net positive not negative at this point in time. And then in terms of Pennsylvania, probably we're a little more cautious in terms of Pennsylvania at this point in time. To your point on e-commerce trends. Eric, we don't see any new trends coming out of this prior season. I think that everybody participating in this space is still desperately trying to figure out the supply chain both the last mile, which everybody is talking about these days all the way to the origin of the product because different participants handle it differently.

The energy pricing generally being lower has led to better consumption numbers. And more of that consumption is shifting to the e-commerce channel, which is more space intensive. So those 2 things have made demand for our product better than they would have been based on the overall economic numbers.

Our expectation there though that you can see another 15 to 30 basis points this year. Trends are good. For the first time, we're viewing Europe as a potential tailwind to the company. The outlook, when you're looking at market vacancies as a whole, that vacancy is not occupancy, vacancies will drop 60 basis points. So we'll be at somewhere around market vacancy is about 5.8%, which is nearing sort of U.S. level, so expect Europe to perform well on a go-forward basis. And in Asia, the markets there I think are performing well. Japan is sitting there at about 96.3% occupied, and we're seeing good net absorption. So Japan is performing well. China is a business that I think some have concern. It's a small business for us, but one that again is performing pretty well. We're at about 92% occupied in our overall portfolio. But if you look at the supplemental, you'll see that there is a list occupied spread of about 200 basis points. So you should expect occupancies in China to trend up. The other comment I'd make about China is that we've done about 2 million square feet of development leasing this quarter, which is about 30% of the total leasing for the quarter for the company. So it's performing pretty very well. So net-net, I'd say that international markets are performing to expectation and will become a tailwind."

So I'll take those questions. First, on LTV. You're right, LTV, you would have appeared, didn't decline enough based on our activity for the quarter and what's happening is it's really a function of weakening of the dollar and the strengthening of the yen and the euro. And there's a denominator effect that I will explain. So when you think about about half of our debts in yen and euro, but only about 25% of our assets are. So when the yen and the euro increased against that liability, that debt, that increase took our debt levels up in U.S. dollar terms by about $300 million. But we didn't have the same $300 million increase in our denominator because only 25% of our assets are in euro and yen. So there's a denominator effect and that impacted leverage by about 70 basis points this quarter. So you really -- economically, we had about 100 basis points decline this quarter, a little over actually. But that's FX noise. On your point about deployment proceeds for the rest of the year and how we're going to use that $1 billion of cash, we're going to look at our debt stack and we're going to determine if there is debt where we can economically or frictionlessly pay that off. We do have a multicurrency term loan that's out there that matures in a couple of years that would fit that bill. We always look at bond maturities to see if there's economically, it makes sense to do that or we'll sit on cash. But I would tell you when you look at our guidance, either the debt that we have to pay off is extremely low-rate debt. So it doesn't have a significant impact on our results for the rest of the year."

The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the new year. We posted record first quarter numbers on rent change, which was stronger than expected at over 20% and c",647,"Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a great start. The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the new year. We posted record first quarter numbers on rent change, which was stronger than expected at over 20% and core FFO, which grew 24% year-over-year. At this point in the cycle, we're pushing rent growth over occupancy. Nevertheless, occupancy is still very high at over 96%. These and other metrics, which Tom will discuss in a moment, point to continued growth ahead for Prologis. 
I'd like to take a moment to elaborate on how and where we make our money. Many of you already know this, but I believe it's worth repeating. We make over 90% of our core FFO by collecting rent. The rest is generated by fees and promotes from our strategic capital business. Together, rents and fees represent a stable cash flow created from our operating portfolio. Separately, the value creation from our development business, including value-added conversions, propels our future earnings growth. So our operating and development activities address how we make money. 
Now as to where we make our money, when collecting rents, 72% is in the U.S. and 28% comes from abroad. Roughly, 90% of our net equity is in US dollars. Many ask us why we're global. In short, we're global because our customers are global. And so we've organized our business to capitalize on this unique aspect of our sector. About 2/3 of our development value creation, fees and promotes are generated outside the U.S. 
As an aside, these benefits actually cover more than 100% of our global overhead. I view Prologis as an owner-operator in the U.S. and a fund manager and developer in Europe and Asia. We have minimal exposure to emerging economies. Market conditions remain favorable in the world's most vibrant centers of commerce. In these strategic locations, demand was solid with supply still very disciplined. These business conditions have persisted for several years now. While we anticipate supply/demand reaching equilibrium this year, we see few obstacles on the road ahead that could disrupt that balance.
In the U.S., quality properties remain scarce, which is leading to strong rent growth and high occupancies. We'll continue to signal watch-list markets. In this quarter, we have no new markets to call out. In Europe and Asia, rents are up modestly from last quarter, balanced by slightly lower occupancies. In Mexico, rents are up slightly and occupancy is flat. While in Brazil, rents are down modestly, but occupancy is at 100%. The key drivers of our business, consumption and e-commerce, continue to grow faster than underlying economies. We have every reason to expect these trends to continue into the future. 
KTR is all paid off. Our funding activities, specifically the short-term loan associated with that deal, concluded less than 1 year after it was announced and ahead of schedule. With the transaction paid in full and the portfolio integrated, today's call is probably the last time you'll hear us talk about KTR. We have capacity to fund more than 5 years of capital deployment. At our current run rate, our total annual funding requirement is $600 million. We expect to fund this through the rebalancing of our co-investment ventures, reducing our land bank and selling our remaining nonstrategic assets. These onetime sources totaled more than $3.5 billion and give us the ability to fund more than 5 years of net deployment activity. 
We'll further simplify our business over time. Over the last several years, we made great strides in optimizing our business to put us on a path for long term sustained earnings growth. In addition, look for us to continue streamline our business through the ongoing realignment of our portfolio, further G&A efficiencies, land bank optimization and reduced leverage. 
Now let me turn it over to Tom for further comments."
330123,329631933,959553,"Prologis, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Prologis, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM. Starting with operations. Occupancy in the U.S. was",946,"Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM. Starting with operations. Occupancy in the U.S. was 96.6% at quarter end and 95.4% outside the U.S. Leasing volume for the quarter was a record at 46 million square feet. 
Just a quick reminder that my comments, as I go through the rest of the operating and capital deployment activity, will focus on our share. GAAP rent change on rollover was an all-time high of 20.1%, led by the U.S. at 27.2% and 4% outside the U.S. GAAP same-store NOI increased 7.4%, positive across all major geographies and driven by the U.S. at 9.6%. There are 2 items I want to highlight. 
First, as we previously discussed, the negative impact on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger burned off in the second quarter of 2015. As a result, this had a positive noncash impact of about 170 basis points on GAAP same-store growth in the quarter. 
Second, expense timing drove an approximate 70 basis points positive impact. After adjusting for these 2 items, GAAP same-store growth was 5%, which is attributable to the strong rental increases and year-over-year occupancy gains. Strategic capital fees were $50 million for the quarter, with a majority coming from our international ventures. Capital deployment activity is progressing as planned. There are 2 items I would like to highlight this quarter. 
First, that our stabilizations had an estimated margin of 27%; and second, that build-to-suits comprised 42% of our development starts. Turning to capital markets. Our leverage on a book basis was 38.1% at quarter end and 33.9% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, improved to 5.6x. 
As Hamid mentioned, we fully repaid the $400 million term loan associated with the KTR acquisition and liquidity remained strong. Last quarter -- I'm sorry, this week, we recast our Global Line of Credit, lowering our spread by 10 basis points and increasing the capacity by $640 million. As a result, our total line capacity is now $3.4 billion, further enhancing our current significant liquidity levels. We expect to see further improvement in our debt metrics throughout the remainder of the year as our venture rebalancings were completed this month and the pace of dispositions accelerate. 
The continued strengthening of our balance sheet was acknowledged this quarter by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, upgraded our credit outlook to positive. We believe we are on the doorstep of an A rating. Before discussing guidance, I wanted to highlight the enhancements to our earnings supplemental this quarter. The changes are based on the feedback we received from investors and analysts as well as to better align our disclosure with how we think about and how we run the company. As part of this, we've revisited the classification of certain personnel costs in our income statement, which had the effect of increasing expenses related to our strategic capital business by $17 million on an annual basis and reducing G&A by the same amount. 
There is no bottom line impact on net income or core FFO. For context, we completed a significant volume of co-investment activity over the past 5 years and almost doubled our third-party AUM. With this increase, we now have more full-time employees dedicated to our strategic capital business. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. We're maintaining guidance for most of our operating metrics, capital deployment and strategic capital revenues, all of which you can see on Page 6 of our supplemental. On same-store NOI, we are increasing the bottom end and narrowing the range to between 4% and 4.5%, with a bias towards the upper half of this range. For net G&A, we are lowering the range to between $218 million and $228 million to reflect the reclassification I just mentioned. 
Related to FX. Our 2016 earnings remain well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations as over 95% are hedged. We continue to expect to generate $1 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs in 2016. This consists of $400 million in net deployment proceeds, $198 million of cash that we already received from the completion of the Facebook installment sale and $400 million from the ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures, which we will receive in a few weeks.
Further, we like what we are seeing in the disposition market and are likely to increase our volume. So while operating conditions are stronger than we expected, we are not increasing our core FFO given the potential dilution from increased dispositions. Therefore, we are maintaining our 2016 core FFO guidance between $2.50 and $2.60 per share. This includes $0.17 to $0.19 per share of promotes, which will recognize in the second half of this year. If we assume normalized annual net promotes of $0.05 per share, our core FFO for 2016 would range between $2.38 to $2.46 per share. 
Core FFO will not be evenly distributed for the balance of the year, given the timing of our asset sales and venture rebalancing. As a result, we expect core FFO to be $0.03 or $0.04 lower in the second quarter, followed by an acceleration in the back half of the year from promote income. 
In closing, we are off to a really good start. Our focus for the rest of the 2016 is simply about capturing the significant spreads between in-place and market rents, generating profitable returns by putting our land bank to work and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

But it appears that that the secular decline in inventory to sales ratio that all of you are used to see in our materials going back, I don't know, 15 years or something, really has reversed in the last 3 years. And there are lots of explanations for it. But the most credible one I think is the one that as more sales shift to e-commerce, there are more skews and there's a need to keep more inventory around. And as a result, there may be a secular shift. If that's the case, that's an unexpected windfall to demand for industrial space. We have not built our business with that expectation. But that will be a nice surprise if it happens and if it has legs forever. So too soon to tell for sure, but I think the early signs are really good."

And I guess, there's a long debate as to whether that business is worth a 1 multiple or a 10 multiple. I can tell you, it's not worth the 15 or 20 multiple that people were valuing it at 2007, that's for sure. But it's worth something. It's worth at least a homebuilder. I think it's worth $3 or $5 a share pretty easily if you look at it as a homebuilder. So you add up all that stuff, the number is around high 40s, low 50s kind of -- for the way I look at our NAV. So I don't even think about it. So I don't think the equation has changed between $40 and $45 because we're still way below where I think the value of the company is. But you got to look at equity in the context of other investment opportunities. If some portfolio comes up on to market or -- I don't think that's going to happen, but if something happens where we have an advantage to buy $45 of NAV at $20, we may take advantage of that. But I don't think that's going to happen. And we're not an issuer of equity. And I think it is a complete waste of time for people to spend energy thinking about that issue at these kinds of numbers."

Entitlement costs are going up. Infrastructure costs are going up. Communities are getting tougher on land. So general trend in land values has been up. I would say, among our many, many parcels, every quarter we value our land using a land residual analysis. And I would say by and large, the trends has been up. There are, I would say, 3 or 4 parcels that of a very large number may be down, but the general trend is up. But it's not up as much as it would've been a year ago or 2 years ago. The pace of land value growth has moderated. The other thing I would point out is that, yes, our land bank is about $1.5 billion for book value, but the market value of that, in our view, again, based on pretty robust analysis is approaching $2 billion, maybe in the low $2 billion range. So in terms of what we can work our land bank down is not $0.5 billion down to $1 billion, it's like $1 billion down to $1 billion in terms of market value because the market value land is what we were targeting for. So we've got quite a bit of liquidity that could come out of the land bank to add to that $3.5 billion that we've talked about."

And Pennsylvania is sort of a combination of a spike in supply and demand tailing off. But I wouldn't draw any conclusions, Eric, about the specific adjustments and vacancy in those markets. I don't think that's going to continue for a long time. I think in both cases, we're going to end up in the sort of mid-90s. But let me say a couple of other things about both of them. So Houston has been on our watch list. Vacancy was up a little bit over the quarter and it has 8 million square feet under construction. We're defensive there and I think we've been saying that for a while. While the macro headwind obviously persists, we're almost 96% leased. The pipe is 50% preleased and there's still a 6% vacancy rate in Houston. And Houston isn't creating a lot of jobs, but it's net positive, not negative, at this point in time. And then in terms of Pennsylvania, probably we're a little more cautious in terms of Pennsylvania at this point in time. To your point on e-commerce trends. Eric, we don't see any new trends coming out of this prior season. I think that everybody participating in this space is still desperately trying to figure out the supply chain both the last mile, which everybody is talking about these days all the way to the origin of the product because different participants handle it differently.

Our expectation there though that you can see another 15 to 30 basis points this year. Trends are good. For the first time, we're viewing Europe as a potential tailwind to the company. The outlook, when you're looking at market vacancies as a whole, is that vacancies, not occupancy, vacancies will drop 60 basis points. So we'll be at somewhere around market vacancy is about 5.8%, which is nearing sort of U.S. level, so we expect Europe to perform well on a go-forward basis. And in Asia, the markets there I think are performing well. Japan is sitting there at about 96.3% occupied, and we're seeing good net absorption. So Japan is performing well. China is a business that I think some have concern. It's a small business for us, but one that again is performing pretty well. We're at about 92% occupied in our overall portfolio. But if you look at the supplemental, you'll see that there is a lease to occupied spread of about 200 basis points. So you should expect occupancies in China to trend up. The other comment I'd make about China is that we've done about 2 million square feet of development leasing this quarter, which is about 30% of the total leasing for the quarter for the company.

So I'll take those questions. First, on LTV. You're right, LTV, you would have appeared, didn't decline enough based on our activity for the quarter and what's happening is it's really a function of weakening of the dollar and the strengthening of the yen and the euro. And there's a denominator effect that I will explain. So when you think about about half of our debts in yen and euro, but only about 25% of our assets are. So when the yen and the euro increase against that liability, that debt, that increase took our debt levels up in U.S. dollar terms by about $300 million. But we didn't have the same $300 million increase in our denominator because only 25% of our assets are in euro and yen. So there's a denominator effect and that impacted leverage by about 70 basis points this quarter. So you really -- economically, we had about 100 basis points decline this quarter, a little over actually. But that's FX noise. On your point about deployment proceeds for the rest of the year and how we're going to use that $1 billion of cash, we're going to look at our debt stack and we're going to determine if there is debt where we can economically or frictionlessly pay that off. We do have a multicurrency term loan that's out there that matures in a couple of years that would fit that bill. We always look at bond maturities to see if there's economically, it makes sense to do that or we'll sit on cash. But I would tell you when you look at our guidance, either the debt that we have to pay off is extremely low-rate debt. So it doesn't have a significant impact on our results for the rest of the year."

We posted another reported good quarter with positive [indiscernible] at almost 18% while maintaining high occupancies. Our core FFO per share grew 15%. Our capital deployment and monetization activities were above expectations as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. In our strategic capital business, we have ample fresh commitment from investors and are well positioned to take advantage of any market opportunities that may present themselves. All in all, the last 6 months have been the best in our company's history. We understand though that some of you are concern about our exposure to Europe generally and to the U.K. specifically. So far, however, the impact of Brexit on our operations has been minimal. Our U.K. customers served mostly domestic consumers and we believe the decision to leave the EU will not materially change the buying habits of 65 million people. We also -- we're also confident in our overall European business. E-commerce and supply chain reconfiguration continue as big drivers of demand for our product. The Class A market is where the action and where our portfolio is focused. Any modest decline in GDP growth with -- in all likelihood be offset by the need to carry slightly higher inventories. In fact, our only concern in Europe is in Poland where a few merchant developers are overbuilding the market by offering rental and of up to 40% and commencing new investors to capitalize artificially inflated headline rents. We don't see this anywhere else in Europe. Surely, there'll be more mixed news coming out of Europe and that will lead to continued market volatility. Whether it's bank failures or constitutional reforms in Italy, or elections in France and The Netherlands, we expect policymakers to keep global interest rates lower for longer. In time, this will translate into support for lower cap rate across Europe. We're confident in the resilience of the logistics real estate business, but we remain vigilant and on the lookout for any signs of trouble. 
Before we turn the call to Tom, Gary Anderson, our CEO of Europe and Asia, will share some underground facts from our business in Europe. You'll hear from him in a moment. 
Elsewhere around the globe, market conditions remain strong and steady. Overall, the supply and demand increase in great shape, with all-time low vacancy rates. Demand is driven by steady growth and consumption, e-commerce and supply chain monetization. In the U.S., rents are up again sharply and we expect absorption will again exceed new supply for the year. In Japan, new supply from development is being absorbed and cap rates continue to compress while occupancy and rents are up in China. Even in our softness market in Brazil, where are 100% leased, but rents there are down about 10% from the peak. Looking across our markets, we only see a few locations of excess supply, specifically Houston, Columbus and as I mentioned earlier, parts of Poland. In these lower markets, private developers and their institutional capital partners are delivering more products than the market can absorb. Other than these few exceptions, our markets are in very good shape. In conclusion, we worked hard to position our company for success and are excited about the prospects for the coming years. Let me now to turn the call over to Gary."

The European market perform very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply.

The European market perform very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.8%. The Prologis portfolio outperformed the market and delivered some of our strongest results on record. Occupancy in our European portfolio is 95.6%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The U.K. led all regions at 98.8% occupied and today, the 22.4 million-square-foot operating pool [ph] in the U.K. is 100% leased. Rent change on roll for the quarter totaled 5.1% in Europe with all regions delivering positive results and was led by the U.K. at 17.6%. I'd like to turn now to our activity post-Brexit and present simply the facts as we see them on the ground from June 23, the date of the vote, through today. Let's begin with leasing. We've completed 56 transactions in Europe totaling just under 4.9 million square feet with 8% positive rent change. The U.K. portion is 1.3 million square feet with 24% rent change during that same post-Brexit period. Demand in Europe still appears to be broad-based and continues to have an emphasis on the automotive and e-commerce sectors. We've completed leases post-Brexit, with many names you'll know including DHL, Schneider Electric, Jaguar, Land Rover, Marks & Spencer, and Ali Baba. Risk associated with our U.K. NOI has been minimized. Today, the U.K. portfolio is 100% leased, has a weighted average lease term of 8 years, has only 11% of leases expiring over the next 18 months and has in-place rates that are roughly 10% below market. Let's now turn to Europe development activity. We've had a very prudent approach to development in Europe with a heavy emphasis on build-to-suits. Today, we have a 6.2 million square foot development portfolio in Europe, which is 60% leased and is approximately 1,000 basis points ahead of our underwriting. The U.K. portion of our development portfolio totals 1.9 million square feet and is 850 basis points ahead of our underwriting. We also expect to execute 2 leases totaling about 570,000 square feet imminently and have good activity on the balance of our U.K. developments. The only exception is a 317,000 square-foot building in London Gateway where there has been little activity even before Brexit. Turning to capital markets and building sales. We sold a 3 billion [ph] portfolio in the U.K. during the second quarter and that transaction closed as planned on June 21, 2 days before the referendum vote. We also began negotiating the sale of EUR 100 million plus French portfolio pre-Brexit and concluded discussions on Friday of last week with no change to our pricing. The buyers are now under contract with a 10% nonrefundable deposit. There's also been some non-Prologis activity to report in the U.K. that underscore solid pricing for logistics assets. 103,000 square-foot building leased to DHL in Birmingham with a 10-year term closed on July 1, at a 4.8% stabilized cap rate and another 176,000 square-foot building let to Amazon for 10 years in Manchester is expected to close at about the same level in the next few days. In addition, our U.K. retail fund has about GBP 50 million of British Telecom logistics deal to market and as buyers transact in just 5 working days. There are reportedly more than 10 bidders at about a 5% stabilize cap rate, probably 15 to 20 basis points higher than we would normally expect but a very small discount when you consider the timescale and lack of due diligence. Beyond that, we're hearing rumors that certain retail funds may bring assets the market to create liquidity and we will monitor those for opportunity. In general, values in the U.K. are driven by lease length and location, so you shouldn't expect to see any meaningful value change in the Prologis U.K. portfolio given our current lease length location and interest rates that are widely believed to be going lower for longer. 
Lastly, let's turn to our funds. Values are up 70 basis points this quarter in our European fronts and incremental leasing and cap rate compression on the continent, but any of these of are flat to slightly down given the negative impact of lower interest rates on debt mark-to-market and FX. While we don't expect to see significant investment activity during the summer months and as a result, we don't expect to see much change in fund values, here is what we can tell you as of today. Our open-end fund has a EUR 400 million equity [indiscernible], its largest ever. We have closed 70 million in new equity commitments in PTELF as planned on June 30, again, post-Brexit from a Swiss capital source. Our open funds in Europe are approximately 30% levered and our JVs are 0% levered, so we have plenty of capital to take advantage of the right opportunity should they arise. On June 30, we had 1 secondary trade occur in our PELP 2 vehicle. It was a EUR 16 million trade at par between a fund that was expiring and an existing PELP 2 investor. The at par trade validates our current fund valuations. To date, we have had no formal redemption requests but have heard some noise about 2 Sterling investors with investment totaling about EUR 45 million that may pursue secondary trades. So let me quickly summarize. Leasing volume and rents appears to be holding -- appeared to be holding up well. On the development front, we are significantly ahead of our underwritten lease-up, new supply is generally in check and we expect to maintain a high build-to-suit percentage this year. While we can't speak to U.K. office or retail, which have their issues, high-quality logistic assets appear to be trading at valuation. And with respect to Prologis we are in great shape with record Qs and capacity to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves. With that, let me turn it over to Tom to take us through the rest of the quarter."

For the second quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.60 per share, exceeding our forecast due to better-than expected real estate operations and higher asset management fees.

For the second quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.60 per share, exceeding our forecast due to better-than expected real estate operations and higher asset management fees. Global occupancy was 96.1% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year. We set another quarterly leasing record at 49 million square feet, including more than 9 million square feet of development leasing. Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was [ph] 17.8%, led by the U.S. of 23.5%. Our share of same-store NOI increased 6.1% with the U.S. leading the way at 7.5%. This is the last quarter that will be impacted by the burn-off of merger lease intangible amortization. Excluding this impact, our share same-store NOI growth for the quarter would have been 5%. For the first half of 2016, development stabilizations were $1.1 billion with an estimated weighted average margin of over 26%. Development starts totaled $658 million with an estimated weighted average margin of over 18%. Build-to-suits comprised almost half of our year-to-date starts. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.2 billion. In terms of total capital proceeds, we've already closed or have under hard contract about 70% of our original full year guidance. 
Turning to capital markets, our leverage at quarter end was 37% on a book basis and 30.6% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x. Our liquidity, which we defined as our undrawn line capacity and available consolidated cash, reached the highest level in our history this quarter. Turning to guidance now for 2016. I'll just cover the material changes so for compete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. Due to stronger operating fundamentals, we're increasing our share same-store NOI range to between 4.75% and 5.25%. In light of our progress year-to-date and investor interest, we're increasing our share of disposition and contribution volume to between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, an increase of $300 million at the midpoint. We will complete an additional ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures for a total of $200 million. This is on top of the $400 million we completed earlier this year. We're also raising the midpoint of our share development starts by $200 million for a range of $1.7 billion $2 billion. We expect our full year build-to-suit percentage to be higher than the 44% we did last year. The net results of our deployment changes is that we now expect to generate $1.3 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs, up $300 million from prior guidance. We will use a portion of the net proceeds to retire debt, with a balance further building up our cash reserves. We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion and booked leverage below 35%. Related to FX, our 2016 and 2017 estimated quarter earnings are fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we have already hedged about half of 2018. 
Putting this all together, our 2016 core FFO, excluding promotes, is higher by $0.03 cents due to better than forecasted operations and fees partially offset by the dilution from an increase and acceleration of the dispositions, contributions and fund rebalancing. In other words, core earnings are higher while at the same time significantly increasing our cash reserves. We expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.52 and $2.58 per share maintaining our $2.55 midpoint. Our promote range is now $0.14 to $0.16 a share, down $0.03 at the midpoint. The decline in the promotes is primarily due to negative debt mark-to-market and FX movements where the pound weakening against the euro. The promote midpoint assumes that asset values remain unchanged with June 30 appraisals and FX rates remain at current levels. To be clear, asset values in Europe have not declined. In fact the appraised if our assets European ventures increased 70 basis points in the second quarter led by the U.K. at 100 basis points.

It's still going faster, but as global trade represents the larger and larger percentage of domestic GDP, the math just drives you there. Because when global trade was only 2% of the total GDP, it has a lot of opportunity to grow, but once it's reached the saturation level, it's tough to have it grow at the same levels. So part of it is just math and nothing else. Part of it has to do with definitely protectionism and also some exchange rate consideration that affect that patterns of global trade. If a global trade is curtailed, which we don't think it's going to be the case, we think around every election, there's a lot of talk protection event. But people know that the people that want protectionism are the very people that actually get hurt by it in the long term. We think notwithstanding the talk around the election season is going to be very little. In fact, we think that CPP is going to go forward and maybe great opportunities in the other direction. So but let's assume for a moment that we're all wrong and depositions will get in the way of global trading. Well, you just have to carry more inventory because you're not sourcing from as many places. The big driver is -- the big drivers of demand though are consumption, fueled by e-commerce and reconfiguration of the supply chain.

We got a good allocation, appropriate allocation to Europe. A lot of the stuff is based on long-term prospects for economic growth -- economic and population growth. If basically, we are invested the way we are across the world for a reason. Over time, the only portfolio shift that we imagine has nothing to do with Brexit. We probably want to be a little heavier in Asia and a little lighter in Europe, but fundamentally on our allocations, regardless of Brexit, are where we want them to be. So the big dial that we use in terms of managing our own allocation is our share of our private capital vehicles. That's really the way we managed the business from our capital exposure. We like our scale in Europe because we're dominant player there and have the best portfolio. And we really like that market position and what it means in terms of what we can do with customers.

Now, if opportunities arise and people start doing stupid things, we would be delighted to take advantage of those things.

There's not a lot of leverage in the system, notwithstanding the headlines that you hear about some of these funds.

It's totally based on deepening our presence in the markets we're already in. And with respect to land and replacement cost, I think land in the U.S. has appreciated quite a bit. And I think the constraints on land and entitlements are significant. And we'll continue to put pressure on some of the most desirable markets in the U.S. like California, and Pacific Northwest and Miami and the like. The markets spend are supply-constrained, I think, there's very little land and very tough to get it to entitled. So I think replacement costs, rent numbers are going up and up in the U.S. I think the land prices have recovered in Europe, but we don't see them zooming ahead because the rents are still relatively slow growing in Europe. They're growing, but they're slow-growing than the U.S. So then as recovered but it's not zooming ahead. In the U.S., land is pretty expensive."

And as a result, you're seeing market rent growth there continuing at 4% to 5% range depending on what submarket you're talking about. And in Japan, probably the most expressive land market in the world, and the other thing that's impacting the replacement costs rents are construction costs. And our team expect that the back half of this year are going to start seeing construction cost rise again as we approach the 2020 Olympics and construction resources become scarce.

And again, we look at that in terms of small business formation and the pace that we've like the most is in Southern Europe where candidly you had the least amount of small business formation. But we have been focused on that segment even in Southern Europe and if you look, we have probably gained 1,200 or 1,400 basis points over the last year in our Southern European portfolio. So this is an area of focus and one where we think opportunities lie certainly in Europe."

And over the last couple of years, when we've really sort of ramp our development up, we've been between 4% and 5%. And as of this quarter, 3.5%. So we're -- I think fairly derisk on that front. And then if you look at it starts in the U.S. for example, and this gets to the customer dialogue, we're 89% pre-leased on the starts this quarter because we had effectively 6 build-to-suits and pre-leased deals. And that's a result of lots and lots of customer dialogue that's taking place over a couple of years at this point. But most of our customers, today their focus how do they plan for the future. Most of them are in the midst of the supply chain reconfiguration of some type. And the markets are so tight. They have to plan, the have to engage those long-term planning. And so I think actually that the nature of that dialogue is shifted dramatically. It hasn't shifted just in the last quarter, it's taking some weird of time. That's why you see lease terms are significantly longer than they were a couple of years ago. And we'd like to think of these discussions are strategic versus transactional. So I think that actually is a pretty significant change we've seen."

I mean, literally, they're asking us to build more spec product and they are coming ahead and telling us where their needs are. And they used to play their cards pretty close to best. Now part of this may be strategic level dialogue that we've created with them I mean, would some of these customers we have 30, 40, 50, 60 leases. You can engage in meaningful dialogue when you have that kind of customer connectivity. Whether if you have random portfolio or may be customers sprinkled in 3 locations, they think all of you more as a vendor than a partner. So I think the business is finally getting to the scale. Not only because of its size, but also because of its focus on the key markets that the dialogue is becoming more and more strategic and that's what we work very hard to create. So we're very encouraged by that. And look to take advantage of it. It manifest itself in very high volumes of build-to-suits, not because we want it to be that way, but because it turns out that way that people want to lock up spec capacity ahead of time. So a lot of these are spec-to-suit or buildings we're going to build anyway that get leased up on a build-to-suit basis before we start, we're minor modifications. It's a good place to be."

So we've been surprised by that last [ph] 10%, we thought we are bringing pretty aggressive youth that guys thought all of you we were crazy the market does turn out to be much more -- we were all very conservative in retrospect and the market blown past that because the replacement cost blown past that.

We had a dry period of 10 to 15 years of very little nominal rental growth and now we're finally getting back to nominal rents that we got in the early 2000.

So when the market is totally steady, spent should be around 15 and build-to-suits should be 10 to 12. Right now, we're probably at market 5 points higher in that for both spec and build-to-suit. More for spec. I would say build-to-suits are 10 to 12 when they get to be really competitive. So we've just been slammed by really good margins. And that we haven't built our business or our forecast based on 30% margins like we have last year."

We posted another great quarter with positive rent change at almost 18% while maintaining high occupancies. Our core FFO per share grew 15%. Our capital deployment and monetization activities were above expectations as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. In our strategic capital business, we have ample fresh commitment from investors and are well positioned to take advantage of any market opportunities that may present themselves. 
All in all, the last 6 months have been the best in our company's history. We understand, though, that some of you are concern about our exposure to Europe generally and to the U.K., specifically. So far, however, the impact of Brexit on our operations has been minimal. Our U.K. customers served mostly domestic consumers, and we believe the decision to leave the EU will not materially change the buying habits of 65 million people. We're also confident in our overall European business. E-commerce and supply chain reconfiguration continue as big drivers of demand for our product. The Class A market is where the action is and where our portfolio is focused. Any modest decline in GDP growth with -- in all likelihood, be offset by the need to carry slightly higher inventories. In fact, our only concern in Europe is in Poland, where a few merchant developers are overbuilding the market by offering rental incentives of up to 40% and commencing new investors to capitalize artificially inflated headline rents. We don't see this anywhere else in Europe. Surely, there'll be more mixed news coming out of Europe and that will lead to continued market volatility. 
Whether it's bank failures or constitutional reforms in Italy, or elections in France and The Netherlands, we expect policymakers to keep global interest rates lower for longer. In time, this will translate into support for lower cap rate across Europe. We're confident in the resilience of the logistics real estate business, but we remain vigilant and on the lookout for any signs of trouble. 
Before we turn the call to Tom, Gary Anderson, our CEO of Europe and Asia, will share some underground facts from our business in Europe. You'll hear from him in a moment. 
Elsewhere around the globe, market conditions remain strong and steady. Overall, the supply and demand proves in great shape, with all-time low vacancy rates. Demand is driven by steady growth and consumption, e-commerce and supply chain monetization. 
In the U.S., rents are up again sharply, and we expect net absorption will again exceed new supply for the year. In Japan, new supply from development is being absorbed, and cap rates continue to compress while occupancy and rents are up in China. Even in our softness market, Brazil were 100% leased, but rents there are down about 10% from the peak. 
Looking across our markets, we only see a few locations of excess supply, specifically Houston, Columbus, and I -- as I mentioned earlier, parts of Poland. In these lower-barrier markets, private developers and their institutional capital partners are delivering more products than the market can absorb. Other than these few exceptions, our markets are in very good shape. 
In conclusion, we've worked hard to position our company for success and are excited about the prospects for the coming years. Let me now to turn the call over to Gary."

The European market performed very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.",1008,"Thanks, Hamid, and good morning. The European market performed very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.8%. The Prologis portfolio outperformed the market and delivered some of our strongest results on record. Occupancy in our European portfolio is 95.6%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The U.K. led all regions at 98.8% occupied and today, the 22.4 million-square-foot operating pool in the U.K. is 100% leased. 
Rent change on roll for the quarter totaled 5.1% in Europe with all regions delivering positive results and was led by the U.K. at 17.6%. 
I'd like to turn now to our activity post-Brexit and present simply the facts as we see them on the ground from June 23, the date of the vote, through today. 
Let's begin with leasing. We've completed 56 transactions in Europe totaling just under 4.9 million square feet with 8% positive rent change. The U.K. portion is 1.3 million square feet with 24% rent change during that same post-Brexit period. Demand in Europe still appears to be broad-based and continues to have an emphasis on the automotive and e-commerce sectors. We've completed leases post-Brexit, with many names you'll know, including DHL, Schneider Electric, Jaguar Land Rover, Marks & Spencer and Alibaba. 
Risk associated with our U.K. NOI has been minimized. Today, the U.K. portfolio is 100% leased, has a weighted average lease term of 8 years, has only 11% of leases expiring over the next 18 months and has in-place rents that are roughly 10% below market. 
Let's now turn to Europe development activity. We've had a very prudent approach to development in Europe with a heavy emphasis on build-to-suit. Today, we have a 6.2 million-square-foot development portfolio in Europe, which is 60% leased and is approximately 1,000 basis points ahead of our underwriting. The U.K. portion of our development portfolio totals 1.9 million square feet and is 850 basis points ahead of our underwriting. We also expect to execute 2 leases totaling about 570,000 square feet imminently and have good activity on the balance of our U.K. developments. The only exception is a 317,000 square-foot building in London Gateway, where there has been little activity even before Brexit. 
Turning to capital markets and building sales. We sold a 3-building portfolio in the U.K. during the second quarter, and that transaction closed as planned on June 21, 2 days before the referendum vote. We also began negotiating the sale of EUR 100 million-plus French portfolio pre-Brexit and concluded discussions on Friday of last week with no change to our pricing. The buyers are now under contract with a 10% nonrefundable deposit. 
There has also been some non-Prologis activity to report in the U.K. that underscore solid pricing for logistics assets. 103,000 square-foot building leased to DHL in Birmingham with a 10-year term closed on July 1, at a 4.8% stabilized cap rate, and another 176,000 square-foot building let to Amazon for 10 years in Manchester is expected to close at about the same level in the next few days. 
In addition, our U.K. retail fund has brought a GBP 50 million British Telecom logistics deal to market, and as [indiscernible] buyers transact in just 5 working days. There are reportedly more than 10 bidders at about a 5% stabilize cap rate, probably 15 to 20 basis points higher than we would normally expect but a very small discount when you consider the timescale and lack of due diligence. Beyond that, we're hearing rumors that certain retail funds may bring assets to market to create liquidity, and we will monitor those for opportunity. 
In general, values in the U.K. are driven by lease length and location, so you shouldn't expect to see any meaningful value change in the Prologis U.K. portfolio given our current lease length location and interest rates that are widely believed to be going lower for longer. 
Lastly, let's turn to our funds. Values are up 70 basis points this quarter in our European funds on incremental leasing and cap rate compression on the continent, but any of these are flat to slightly down given the negative impact of lower interest rates on debt mark-to-market and FX. 
While we don't expect to see significant investment activity during the summer months, and as a result, we don't expect to see much change in fund values, here is what we can tell you as of today. 
Our open-end fund PTELF has a EUR 400 million equity queue, its largest ever. We have closed EUR 70 million in new equity commitments in PTELF as planned on June 30, again, post-Brexit, from a Swiss capital source. Our open funds in Europe are approximately 30% levered, and our JVs are 0% levered, so we have plenty of capital to take advantage of the right opportunity, should they arise. 
On June 30, we had one secondary trade occur in our PEPF II vehicle. It was a EUR 16 million trade at par between a fund that was expiring and an existing PEPF II investor. The at-par trade validates our current fund valuations. 
To date, we have had no formal redemption requests but have heard some noise about 2 Sterling investors with investment totaling about EUR 45 million that may pursue secondary trades. 
So let me quickly summarize. Leasing volume and rent appear to be holding up well. On the development front, we are significantly ahead of our underwritten lease-up, new supply is generally in check and we expect to maintain a high build-to-suit percentage this year. 
While we can't speak to U.K. office or retail, which have their issues, high-quality logistic assets appear to be trading at valuation. And with respect to Prologis funds, we are in great shape with record queues and capacity to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tom to take us through the rest of the quarter."

For the second quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.60 per share, exceeding our forecast due to better-than-expected real estate operations and higher asset management fees. 
Global occupancy was 96.1% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year. We set another quarterly leasing record at 49 million square feet, including more than 9 million square feet of development leasing. 
Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was 17.8%, led by the U.S. of 23.5%. Our share of same-store NOI increased 6.1%, with U.S. leading the way at 7.5%. This is the last quarter that will be impacted by the burn-off of merger lease intangible amortization. Excluding this impact, our share same-store NOI growth for the quarter would have been 5%. 
For the first half of 2016, development stabilizations were $1.1 billion with an estimated weighted average margin of over 26%. Development starts totaled $658 million with an estimated weighted average margin of over 18%. Build-to-suits comprised almost half of our year-to-date starts. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.2 billion. 
In terms of total capital proceeds, we've already closed or have under hard contract about 70% of our original full year guidance. 
Turning to capital markets, our leverage at quarter end was 37% on a book basis and 30.6% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x. Our liquidity, which we defined as our undrawn line capacity and available consolidated cash, reached the highest level in our history this quarter. 
Turning to guidance now for 2016. I'll just cover the material changes so for compete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. 
Due to stronger operating fundamentals, we're increasing our share same-store NOI range to between 4.75% and 5.25%. In light of our progress year-to-date and investor interest, we're increasing our share of disposition and contribution volume to between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, an increase of $300 million at the midpoint. We will complete an additional ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures for a total of $200 million. This is on top of the $400 million we completed earlier this year. We're also raising the midpoint of our share development starts by $200 million for a range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. We expect our full year build-to-suit percentage to be higher than the 44% we did last year. 
The net result of our deployment changes is that we now expect to generate $1.3 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs, up $300 million from prior guidance. We will use a portion of the net proceeds to retire debt, with a balance further building up our cash reserves. We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion and booked leverage below 35%. 
Related to FX, our 2016 and 2017 estimated quarter earnings are fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar, and we have already hedged about half of 2018. 
Putting this all together, our 2016 core FFO, excluding promotes, is higher by $0.03 cents due to better-than-forecasted operations and fees, partially offset by the dilution from an increase and acceleration of the dispositions, contributions and fund rebalancing. In other words, core earnings are higher while, at the same time, significantly increasing our cash reserves. We expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.52 and $2.58 per share, maintaining our $2.55 midpoint. Our promote range is now $0.14 to $0.16 a share, down $0.03 at the midpoint. The decline in the promotes is primarily due to negative debt mark-to-market and FX movements from the pound weakening against the euro. The promote midpoint assumes that asset values remain unchanged with June 30 appraisals and FX rates remain at current levels. To be clear, asset values in Europe have not declined. In fact, the appraised if our assets in our European ventures increased 70 basis points in the second quarter led by the U.K. at 100 basis points. 
To wrap up, we expect continued strong NOI growth as we harvest the GAAP between in-place and market rents. We're maintaining strong double-digit core FFO growth in 2016 while, at the same time, further strengthening our balance sheet and building liquidity. Our financial position has never been stronger, and we'll continue to improve by year-end as we generate additional proceeds from net deployment. 
With that, I'll turn it to -- over to the operator for your questions."

Global trade, which used to run at the about 3X the sum of domestic GDP, has slowed down to about 1.2, 1.3x the size -- the pace of global domestic GDP. It's still going a little bit faster, but as global trade represents a larger and larger percentage of domestic GDP, the math just drives you there. Because when global trade was only 2% of total GDP, it has a lot of opportunity to grow. But once it's reached the saturation level, it's tough to have it grow at the same levels. So part of it is just math and nothing else. Part of it has to do with definitely protectionism and also some exchange rate considerations that affect that patterns of global trade. If global trade is curtailed, which we don't think is going to be the case, we think around every election, there's a lot of talk of protectionism but people know that the people that want protectionism are the very people that actually get hurt by it in the long term. We think notwithstanding the talk around the election season is going to be very little. In fact, we think that CPP is going to go forward and maybe great opportunities in the other direction. So -- but let's assume for a moment that we're all wrong in global and the partitions will get in the way of global trading. Well, you just have to carry more inventory because you're not sourcing to get it from as many places. The big driver is -- the big drivers of demand, though, are consumption fueled by e-commerce and reconfiguration of the supply chain. Those are the real biggies now that global trade has reached the saturation point."

Look, our business is just a real estate business, and we're not a hedge fund. We don't make decisions minute-by-minute. This is a long-term business. We've got a good allocation, appropriate allocation to Europe. A lot of these stuff is based on long-term prospects for economic and population growth. If basically, the -- we are invested the way we are across the world for a reason. Over time, the only portfolio shift that we imagine has nothing to do with Brexit. We probably want to be a little heavier in Asia and a little lighter in Europe, but fundamentally, our allocations, regardless of Brexit, are where we want them to be. So the big dial that we use in terms of managing our own allocation is our share of our private capital vehicles. That's really the way we managed the business from our capital exposure. We like our scale in Europe because we're the dominant player there and have the best portfolio. And we really like that market position and what it means in terms of what we can do with customers. 
So long-winded answer of saying that we like our hand, we like our position in the U.K, we're willing to -- we think that the U.K. is going to continue to best market in Europe, actually, in the next 10 years. It might take a pause in the short term, but the long-term dynamics of it are quite interesting. 
So we're good where we are. 
Now if opportunities arise and people start doing stupid things, we would be delighted to take advantage of those things. I don't think it will happen. I think by and large, European real estate is in strong institutional hands. There's not a lot of leverage in the system, notwithstanding the headlines that you hear about some of these open-end funds. And there may be pressure, by the way, on financial center-type office buildings in the U.K. But in our product type, we think there are more buyers than sellers of the quality product that we have. So we don't think those distressed opportunities are going to materialize, but if they do, we're prepared to take advantage of that."

It's totally based on deepening our presence in the markets we're already in. And with respect to land and replacement cost, I think land in the U.S. has appreciated quite a bit. And I think the constraints on land and its entitlements are significant. And we'll continue to put pressure on some of the most desirable markets in the U.S. like California in the Pacific Northwest and Miami and the like. The markets that are supply-constrained, I think, there's very little land and very tough to get it entitled. So I think replacement costs, rent numbers are going up and up in the U.S. I think land prices have recovered in Europe, but we don't see them zooming ahead because the rents are still relatively slow growing in Europe. They're growing, but they're much slower growing than the U.S. So land has recovered but it's not zooming ahead. In the U.S., land is pretty expensive."

Somebody asked the question earlier about our development volumes in China and, obviously, they're increasing. But each incremental piece of land that we buy in China, even if it's phase 2, is incrementally more expensive than the land that we just acquired right next door. And as a result, you're seeing market rent growth there continuing at 4% to 5% range depending on what submarket you're talking about. And in Japan, probably the most expressive land market in the world, and the other thing that's impacting replacement costs rents are construction costs. Then our teams expect that the back half of this year we're going to start to see construction cost rise again as we approach the 2020 Olympics and construction resources become scarce.

I mean, we are living in a pretty difficult geopolitical environment and there are some domestic issues going on that are very concerning that could have spill over to the economy. So those kinds, I'll argue, we're having as prudent capital structure so that we can -- you can go through any scenario and maybe even capitalize on some other opportunities that come up in those kinds of scenarios, which is not a position we're in, in the last cycle. So we have learned our lessons and I think we're adequately prepared for those types of situations. But I don't really see anything on the real estate markets that concern me. Remember, demand was never and still is not spectacular. I think demand on the 10-point scale is a 6. I just think supply is kind of the 4 to 5. And that's what's been keeping the markets healthy. So it's really the other stuff, the geopolitical and domestic political issues and all the stuff that we read about in newspapers and watch on TV, very concerned about those."

One way to think about the -- kind of risking new development program is if you take all your vacant development, no matter what condition it's in, what percentage of your overall portfolio development and operating, what does that represent? And over the last couple of years, when we've really sort of ramp our development up, we've been between 4% and 5%. And as of this quarter, it's 3.5%. So we're -- I think fairly derisk on that front. And then if you look at -- you look at starts on the U.S. for example, and this gets to the customer dialogue, we're 89% pre-leased on the starts this quarter because we had effectively 6 build-to-suits or pre-leased deals. And that's a result of lots and lots of customer dialogue that's taking place over a couple of years at this point. But most of our customers, today their focus is on how do they plan for the future. Most of them are in the midst of a supply chain reconfiguration of some type. And the markets are so tight. They have to plan, they have to engage with us more in long-term planning. And so I think actually that the nature of that dialogue is shifted dramatically. It hasn't shifted just in the last quarter, it's taking some period of time but that's why you see lease terms are significantly longer than they were a couple of years ago. And we'd like to think these discussions are strategic versus transactional. So I think that actually is a pretty significant change that we've seen."

I mean, literally, they're asking us to build more spec product and they are coming ahead and telling us where their needs are. And they used to play their cards pretty close to their vest. Now part of this may be just that level of strategic dialogue that we've created with them I mean, with some of these customers we have 30, 40, 50, 60 leases. You can engage in meaningful dialogue when you have that kind of customer connectivity; whereas if you have random portfolio and may be the customer sprinkled in 3 locations, they think of you more as a vendor than a partner. So I think the business is finally getting to the scale. Not only because of its size, but also because of its focus on the key markets that the dialogue is becoming more and more strategic and that's what we work very hard to create. So we're very encouraged by all that. And look to take advantage of it. It manifest itself in very high volumes of build-to-suits, not because we want it to be that way, but because it turns out that way that people want to lock up spec capacity ahead of time. So a lot of these are spec-to-suit or buildings we're going to build anyway that get leased up on a build-to-suit basis before we start with minor modifications. It's a good place to be."

Back in 2012, when we laid out that crazy scenario of 25% rental growth in the U.S., we've blown through that. And remember there was another phase after that, which is where would market rents go when replacement costs recovered, when construction cost recovered because everybody was working for nothing then and when land cost recovered. That's a whole another acceleration of replacement cost, which is really pushing rent, if you go back to that time more like 35% from that time. So we've been surprised by that last 10%, we thought we're being pretty aggressive. You guys thought all of you -- we were crazy. The market it turned out to be much more -- we were all very conservative in retrospect and the market has blown past that because replacement cost that's blown past that. And we shouldn't really be surprised because nominal rent today are only a few percent higher than what they were in 2000. We had a dry period of 10 to 15 years of very little nominal rental growth and now we're finally getting back to nominal rents that we got in the early 2000. On a real basis, we're still 35% below where we should be. I'm not saying we're going to have 35% more rental growth, don't get me wrong, but I'm just saying nominally, where we were 15 years ago we shouldn't be this surprised. But I guess when you were in the depth -- we were all in the depths of 2012, none of us had enough vision to project 35%, 40% rental growth but that's what's happening."

Other markets that we've called out Columbus, again not a horrendous situation but they have excess of client and a forward pipeline that concerns us. And otherwise, we look at this all the time as you know, other markets just don't scream bad at this point. Dallas has a lot of construction going on and Dallas has a forward supply scenario that has us sort of cautious. But again, a lot of that's in South Dallas, most of our development, most of our portfolio is around the airport in the north now. So I could go on about other markets but the reality is that we're in pretty good shape in these markets in the U.S. And there's something else I'd point out, Eric, and this is worth noting and watching going forward. We've called out a couple of markets historically over last several quarters Indianapolis is one of them, Central and Eastern Pennsylvania. And what's happened and frankly, I haven't seen this happen before in my career is we -- markets got closed doing over building situation or maybe a little over the line and they've corrected. So both of those markets are actually -- they've taken the foot of the gas, they'd lowered the supply level and they've made corrections.

We posted another great quarter with positive rent change at almost 18% while maintaining high occupancies. Our core FFO per share grew 15%. Our capital deployment and monetization activities were above expectations as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. In our strategic capital business, we have ample fresh commitment from investors and are well positioned to take advantage of any market opportunities that may present themselves. 
All in all, the last 6 months have been the best in our company's history. We understand, though, that some of you are concern about our exposure to Europe generally and to the U.K., specifically. So far, however, the impact of Brexit on our operations has been minimal. Our U.K. customers served mostly domestic consumers, and we believe the decision to leave the EU will not materially change the buying habits of 65 million people. We're also confident in our overall European business. E-commerce and supply chain reconfiguration continue as big drivers of demand for our product. The Class A market is where the action is and where our portfolio is focused. Any modest decline in GDP growth with -- in all likelihood, be offset by the need to carry slightly higher inventories. In fact, our only concern in Europe is in Poland, where a few merchant developers are overbuilding the market by offering rental incentives of up to 40% and commencing new investors to capitalize artificially inflated headline rents. We don't see this anywhere else in Europe. Surely, there'll be more mixed news coming out of Europe and that will lead to continued market volatility. 
Whether it's bank failures or constitutional reforms in Italy, or elections in France and The Netherlands, we expect policymakers to keep global interest rates lower for longer. In time, this will translate into support for lower cap rate across Europe. We're confident in the resilience of the logistics real estate business, but we remain vigilant and on the lookout for any signs of trouble. 
Before we turn the call to Tom, Gary Anderson, our CEO of Europe and Asia, will share some underground facts from our business in Europe. You'll hear from him in a moment. 
Elsewhere around the globe, market conditions remain strong and steady. Overall, the supply and demand proves in great shape, with all-time low vacancy rates. Demand is driven by steady growth and consumption, e-commerce and supply chain monetization. 
In the U.S., rents are up again sharply, and we expect net absorption will again exceed new supply for the year. In Japan, new supply from development is being absorbed, and cap rates continue to compress while occupancy and rents are up in China. Even in our softness market, Brazil were 100% leased, but rents there are down about 10% from the peak. 
Looking across our markets, we only see a few locations of excess supply, specifically Houston, Columbus, and I -- as I mentioned earlier, parts of Poland. In these lower-barrier markets, private developers and their institutional capital partners are delivering more products than the market can absorb. Other than these few exceptions, our markets are in very good shape. 
In conclusion, we've worked hard to position our company for success and are excited about the prospects for the coming years. Let me now to turn the call over to Gary."

The European market performed very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.",1008,"Thanks, Hamid, and good morning. The European market performed very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.8%. The Prologis portfolio outperformed the market and delivered some of our strongest results on record. Occupancy in our European portfolio is 95.6%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The U.K. led all regions at 98.8% occupied and today, the 22.4 million-square-foot operating pool in the U.K. is 100% leased. 
Rent change on roll for the quarter totaled 5.1% in Europe with all regions delivering positive results and was led by the U.K. at 17.6%. 
I'd like to turn now to our activity post-Brexit and present simply the facts as we see them on the ground from June 23, the day of the vote, through today. 
Let's begin with leasing. We've completed 56 transactions in Europe totaling just under 4.9 million square feet with 8% positive rent change. The U.K. portion is 1.3 million square feet with 24% rent change during that same post-Brexit period. Demand in Europe still appears to be broad-based and continues to have an emphasis on the automotive and e-commerce sectors. We've completed leases post-Brexit, with many names you'll know, including DHL, Schneider Electric, Jaguar Land Rover, Marks & Spencer and Alibaba. 
Risk associated with our U.K. NOI has been minimized. Today, the U.K. portfolio is 100% leased, has a weighted average lease term of 8 years, has only 11% of leases expiring over the next 18 months and has in-place rents that are roughly 10% below market. 
Let's now turn to Europe development activity. We've had a very prudent approach to development in Europe with a heavy emphasis on build-to-suit. Today, we have a 6.2 million-square-foot development portfolio in Europe, which is 60% leased and is approximately 1,000 basis points ahead of our underwriting. The U.K. portion of our development portfolio totals 1.9 million square feet and is 850 basis points ahead of our underwriting. We also expect to execute 2 leases totaling about 570,000 square feet imminently and have good activity on the balance of our U.K. developments. The only exception is a 317,000 square-foot building in London Gateway, where there has been little activity even before Brexit. 
Turning to capital markets and building sales. We sold a 3-building portfolio in the U.K. during the second quarter, and that transaction closed as planned on June 21, 2 days before the referendum vote. We also began negotiating the sale of EUR 100 million-plus French portfolio pre-Brexit and concluded discussions on Friday of last week with no change to our pricing. The buyers are now under contract with a 10% nonrefundable deposit. 
There has also been some non-Prologis activity to report in the U.K. that underscore solid pricing for logistics assets. 103,000 square-foot building leased to DHL in Birmingham with a 10-year term closed on July 1, at a 4.8% stabilized cap rate, and another 176,000 square-foot building lent to Amazon for 10 years in Manchester is expected to close at about the same level in the next few days. 
In addition, a U.K. retail fund has brought a GBP 50 million British Telecom logistics deal to market, and as active buyers transact in just 5 working days, there are reportedly more than 10 bidders at about a 5% stabilize cap rate, probably 15 to 20 basis points higher than we would normally expect but a very small discount when you consider the timescale and lack of due diligence. Beyond that, we're hearing rumors that certain retail funds may bring assets to market to create liquidity, and we will monitor those for opportunity. 
In general, values in the U.K. are driven by lease length and location, so you shouldn't expect to see any meaningful value change in the Prologis U.K. portfolio given our current lease length location and interest rates that are widely believed to be going lower for longer. 
Lastly, let's turn to our funds. Values are up 70 basis points this quarter in our European funds on incremental leasing and cap rate compression on the continent, but any of these are flat to slightly down given the negative impact of lower interest rates on debt mark-to-market and FX. 
While we don't expect to see significant investment activity during the summer months, and as a result, we don't expect to see much change in fund values, here is what we can tell you as of today. 
Our open-end fund PTELF has a EUR 400 million equity queue, its largest ever. We have closed EUR 70 million in new equity commitments in PTELF as planned on June 30, again, post-Brexit, from a Swiss capital source. Our open funds in Europe are approximately 30% levered, and our JVs are 0% levered, so we have plenty of capital to take advantage of the right opportunity, should they arise. 
On June 30, we had one secondary trade occur in our PEPF II vehicle. It was a EUR 16 million trade at par between a fund that was expiring and an existing PEPF II investor. The at-par trade validates our current fund valuations. 
To date, we have had no formal redemption requests but have heard some noise about 2 Sterling investors with investment totaling about EUR 45 million that may pursue secondary trades. 
So let me quickly summarize. Leasing volume and rent appear to be holding up well. On the development front, we are significantly ahead of our underwritten lease-up, new supply is generally in check and we expect to maintain a high build-to-suit percentage this year. 
While we can't speak to U.K. office or retail, which have their issues, high-quality logistic assets appear to be trading at valuation. And with respect to Prologis funds, we are in great shape with record queues and capacity to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tom to take us through the rest of the quarter."

For the second quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.60 per share, exceeding our forecast due to better-than-expected real estate operations and higher asset management fees. 
Global occupancy was 96.1% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year. We set another quarterly leasing record at 49 million square feet, including more than 9 million square feet of development leasing. 
Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was 17.8%, led by the U.S. at 23.5%. Our share of same-store NOI increased 6.1%, with U.S. leading the way at 7.5%. This is the last quarter that will be impacted by the burn-off of merger lease intangible amortization. Excluding this impact, our share same-store NOI growth for the quarter would have been 5%. 
For the first half of 2016, development stabilizations were $1.1 billion with an estimated weighted average margin of over 26%. Development starts totaled $658 million with an estimated weighted average margin of over 18%. Build-to-suits comprised almost half of our year-to-date starts. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.2 billion. 
In terms of total capital proceeds, we've already closed or have under hard contract about 70% of our original full year guidance. 
Turning to capital markets, our leverage at quarter end was 37% on a book basis and 30.6% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x. Our liquidity, which we defined as our undrawn line capacity and available consolidated cash, reached the highest level in our history this quarter. 
Turning to guidance now for 2016. I'll just cover the material changes so for compete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. 
Due to stronger operating fundamentals, we're increasing our share same-store NOI range to between 4.75% and 5.25%. In light of our progress year-to-date and investor interest, we're increasing our share of disposition and contribution volume to between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, an increase of $300 million at the midpoint. We will complete an additional ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures for a total of $200 million. This is on top of the $400 million we completed earlier this year. We're also raising the midpoint of our share development starts by $200 million for a range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. We expect our full year build-to-suit percentage to be higher than the 44% we did last year. 
The net result of our deployment changes is that we now expect to generate $1.3 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs, up $300 million from prior guidance. We will use a portion of the net proceeds to retire debt, with a balance further building up our cash reserves. We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion and booked leverage below 35%. 
Related to FX, our 2016 and 2017 estimated quarter earnings are fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar, and we have already hedged about half of 2018. 
Putting this all together, our 2016 core FFO, excluding promotes, is higher by $0.03 cents due to better-than-forecasted operations and fees, partially offset by the dilution from an increase and acceleration of the dispositions, contributions and fund rebalancing. In other words, core earnings are higher while, at the same time, significantly increasing our cash reserves. We expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.52 and $2.58 per share, maintaining our $2.55 midpoint. Our promote range is now $0.14 to $0.16 a share, down $0.03 at the midpoint. The decline in the promotes is primarily due to negative debt mark-to-market and FX movements from the pound weakening against the euro. The promote midpoint assumes that asset values remain unchanged with June 30 appraisals and FX rates remain at current levels. To be clear, asset values in Europe have not declined. In fact, the appraised value of our assets in our European ventures increased 70 basis points in the second quarter led by the U.K. at 100 basis points. 
To wrap up, we expect continued strong NOI growth as we harvest the GAAP between in-place and market rents. We're maintaining strong double-digit core FFO growth in 2016 while, at the same time, further strengthening our balance sheet and building liquidity. Our financial position has never been stronger, and it will continue to improve by year-end as we generate additional proceeds from net deployment.

Global trade, which used to run at the about 3X the sum of domestic GDP, has slowed down to about 1.2, 1.3x the size -- the pace of global domestic GDP. It's still going a little bit faster, but as global trade represents a larger and larger percentage of domestic GDP, the math just drives you there. Because when global trade was only 2% of total GDP, it had a lot of opportunity to grow. But once it's reached the saturation level, it's tough to have it grow at the same levels. So part of it is just math and nothing else. Part of it has to do with definitely protectionism and also some exchange rate considerations that affect that patterns of global trade. If global trade is curtailed, which we don't think is going to be the case, we think around every election, there's a lot of talk of protectionism but people know that the people that want protectionism are the very people that actually get hurt by it in the long term. We think notwithstanding the talk around the election season is going to be very little. In fact, we think that CPP is going to go forward and maybe great opportunities in the other direction. So -- but let's assume for a moment that we're all wrong in global and the politicians will get in the way of global trading. Well, you just have to carry more inventory because you're not sourcing to get it from as many places. The big driver is -- the big drivers of demand, though, are consumption fueled by e-commerce and reconfiguration of the supply chain.

So it's not as if it takes a lot of imagination to get to strong same-store growth numbers in the U.S. The mark-to-market is the driver. Gary?"

Look, our business is just a real estate business, and we're not a hedge fund. We don't make decisions minute-by-minute. This is a long-term business. We've got a good allocation, appropriate allocation to Europe. A lot of this stuff is based on long-term prospects for economic and population growth. If basically, the -- we are invested the way we are across the world for a reason. Over time, the only portfolio shift that we imagine has nothing to do with Brexit. We probably want to be a little heavier in Asia and a little lighter in Europe, but fundamentally, our allocations, regardless of Brexit, are where we want them to be. So the big dial that we use in terms of managing our own allocation is our share of our private capital vehicles. That's really the way we managed the business from our capital exposure. We like our scale in Europe because we're the dominant player there and have the best portfolio. And we really like that market position and what it means in terms of what we can do with customers. 
So long-winded answer of saying that we like our hand, we like our position in the U.K, we're willing to -- we think that the U.K. is going to continue to be the best market in Europe, actually, in the next 10 years. It might take a pause in the short term, but the long-term dynamics of it are quite interesting. 
So we're good where we are. 
Now if opportunities arise and people start doing stupid things, we would be delighted to take advantage of those things. I don't think it will happen. I think by and large, European real estate is in strong institutional hands. There's not a lot of leverage in the system, notwithstanding the headlines that you hear about some of these open-end funds. And there may be pressure, by the way, on financial center-type office buildings in the U.K. But in our product type, we think there are more buyers than sellers of the quality of product that we have. So we don't think those distressed opportunities are going to materialize, but if they do, we're prepared to take advantage of that."

We are not planning to go to any new markets. In fact, we're in the process of completing our strategic plan vision 2020. And in it, it doesn't contemplate going into any new markets. It's totally based on deepening our presence in the markets we're already in. And with respect to land and replacement cost, I think land in the U.S. has appreciated quite a bit. And I think the constraints on land and its entitlements are significant. And we'll continue to put pressure on some of the most desirable markets in the U.S. like California in the Pacific Northwest and Miami and the like. The markets that are supply-constrained, I think, there's very little land and very tough to get it entitled. So I think replacement costs, rent numbers are going up and up in the U.S. I think land prices have recovered in Europe, but we don't see them zooming ahead because the rents are still relatively slow growing in Europe. They're growing, but they're much slower growing than the U.S. So land has recovered but it's not zooming ahead. In the U.S., land is pretty expensive."

Somebody asked the question earlier about our development volumes in China and, obviously, they're increasing. But each incremental piece of land that we buy in China, even if it's phase 2, is incrementally more expensive than the land that we just acquired right next door. And as a result, you're seeing market rent growth there continuing at 4% to 5% range depending on what submarket you're talking about. And in Japan, probably the most expressive land market in the world, and the other thing that's impacting replacement costs rents are construction costs. Then our teams expect that the back half of this year we're going to start to see construction cost rise again as we approach the 2020 Olympics and construction resources become scarce.

One way to think about the -- kind of risking new development program is if you take all your vacant development, no matter what condition it's in, what percentage of your overall portfolio development and operating, what does that represent?

And then if you look at -- you look at starts on the U.S. for example, and this gets to the customer dialogue, we're 89% pre-leased on the starts this quarter because we had effectively 6 build-to-suits or pre-leased deals. And that's a result of lots and lots of customer dialogue that's taking place over a couple of years at this point. But most of our customers, today their focus is on how do they plan for the future. Most of them are in the midst of a supply chain reconfiguration of some type. And the markets are so tight. They have to plan, they have to engage with us more in long-term planning. And so I think actually that the nature of that dialogue is shifted dramatically. It hasn't shifted just in the last quarter, it's taking some period of time but that's why you see lease terms are significantly longer than they were a couple of years ago. And we'd like to think these discussions are strategic versus transactional. So I think that actually is a pretty significant change that we've seen."

I mean, literally, they're asking us to build more spec product and they are coming ahead and telling us where their needs are. And they used to play their cards pretty close to their vest. Now part of this may be just that level of strategic dialogue that we've created with them I mean, with some of these customers we have 30, 40, 50, 60 leases. You can engage in meaningful dialogue when you have that kind of customer connectivity; whereas if you have a random portfolio and maybe the customer is sprinkled in 3 locations, they think of you more as a vendor than a partner. So I think the business is finally getting to the scale, not only because of its size, but also because of its focus on the key markets that the dialogue is becoming more and more strategic and that's what we work very hard to create. So we're very encouraged by all that. And look to take advantage of it.

So a lot of these are spec-to-suit or buildings we're going to build anyway that get leased up on a build-to-suit basis before we start with very minor modifications. It's a good place to be."

Back in 2012, when we laid out that crazy scenario of 25% rental growth in the U.S., we've blown through that. And remember there was another phase after that, which is where would market rents go when replacement costs recovered, when construction cost recovered because everybody was working for nothing then and when land cost recovered. That's a whole another acceleration of replacement cost, which is really pushing rent, if you go back to that time more like 35% from that time. So we've been surprised by that last 10%, we thought we're being pretty aggressive. You guys thought all of you -- we were crazy. The market it turned out to be much more -- we were all very conservative in retrospect and the market has blown past that because replacement cost that's blown past that. And we shouldn't really be surprised because nominal rent today are only a few percent higher than what they were in 2000. We had a dry period of 10 to 15 years of very little nominal rental growth and now we're finally getting back to nominal rents that we got in the early 2000. On a real basis, we're still 35% below where we should be. I'm not saying we're going to have 35% more rental growth, don't get me wrong, but I'm just saying nominally, where we were 15 years ago we shouldn't be this surprised. But I guess when you were in the depth -- we were all in the depths of 2012, none of us had enough vision to project 35%, 40% rental growth but that's what's happening."

And otherwise, we look at this all the time as you know, other markets just don't scream bad at this point. Dallas has a lot of construction going on and Dallas has a forward supply scenario that has us sort of cautious. But again, a lot of that's in South Dallas, most of our development, most of our portfolio is around the airport in the north now. So I could go on about other markets but the reality is that we're in pretty good shape in these markets in the U.S. And there's something else I'd point out, Eric, and this is worth noting and watching going forward. We've called out a couple of markets historically over the last several quarters Indianapolis is one of them, Central and Eastern Pennsylvania. And what's happened and frankly, I haven't seen this happen before in my career is we -- markets got closed doing over building situation or maybe a little over the line and they've corrected. So both of those markets are actually -- they've taken the foot of the gas, they'd lowered the supply level and they've made corrections.

We posted another great quarter with positive rent change at almost 18% while maintaining high occupancies. Our core FFO per share grew 15%. Our capital deployment and monetization activities were above expectations as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. In our strategic capital business, we have ample fresh commitment from investors and are well positioned to take advantage of any market opportunities that may present themselves. 
All in all, the last 6 months have been the best in our company's history. We understand, though, that some of you are concern about our exposure to Europe generally and to the U.K., specifically. So far, however, the impact of Brexit on our operations has been minimal. Our U.K. customers served mostly domestic consumers, and we believe the decision to leave the EU will not materially change the buying habits of 65 million people. We're also confident in our overall European business. E-commerce and supply chain reconfiguration continue as big drivers of demand for our product. The Class A market is where the action is and where our portfolio is focused. Any modest decline in GDP growth with -- in all likelihood, be offset by the need to carry slightly higher inventories. In fact, our only concern in Europe is in Poland, where a few merchant developers are overbuilding the market by offering rental incentives of up to 40% and commencing new investors to capitalize artificially inflated headline rents. We don't see this anywhere else in Europe. Surely, there'll be more mixed news coming out of Europe and that will lead to continued market volatility. 
Whether it's bank failures or constitutional reforms in Italy, or elections in France and The Netherlands, we expect policymakers to keep global interest rates lower for longer. In time, this will translate into support for lower cap rate across Europe. We're confident in the resilience of the logistics real estate business, but we remain vigilant and on the lookout for any signs of trouble. 
Before we turn the call to Tom, Gary Anderson, our CEO of Europe and Asia, will share some underground facts from our business in Europe. You'll hear from him in a moment. 
Elsewhere around the globe, market conditions remain strong and steady. Overall, the supply and demand proves in great shape, with all-time low vacancy rates. Demand is driven by steady growth and consumption, e-commerce and supply chain monetization. 
In the U.S., rents are up again sharply, and we expect net absorption will again exceed new supply for the year. In Japan, new supply from development is being absorbed, and cap rates continue to compress while occupancy and rents are up in China. Even in our softness market, Brazil were 100% leased, but rents there are down about 10% from the peak. 
Looking across our markets, we only see a few locations of excess supply, specifically Houston, Columbus, and I -- as I mentioned earlier, parts of Poland. In these lower-barrier markets, private developers and their institutional capital partners are delivering more products than the market can absorb. Other than these few exceptions, our markets are in very good shape. 
In conclusion, we've worked hard to position our company for success and are excited about the prospects for the coming years. Let me now to turn the call over to Gary."

The European market performed very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.",1008,"Thanks, Hamid, and good morning. The European market performed very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.8%. The Prologis portfolio outperformed the market and delivered some of our strongest results on record. Occupancy in our European portfolio is 95.6%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The U.K. led all regions at 98.8% occupied and today, the 22.4 million-square-foot operating pool in the U.K. is 100% leased. 
Rent change on roll for the quarter totaled 5.1% in Europe with all regions delivering positive results and was led by the U.K. at 17.6%. 
I'd like to turn now to our activity post-Brexit and present simply the facts as we see them on the ground from June 23, the day of the vote, through today. 
Let's begin with leasing. We've completed 56 transactions in Europe totaling just under 4.9 million square feet with 8% positive rent change. The U.K. portion is 1.3 million square feet with 24% rent change during that same post-Brexit period. Demand in Europe still appears to be broad-based and continues to have an emphasis on the automotive and e-commerce sectors. We've completed leases post-Brexit, with many names you'll know, including DHL, Schneider Electric, Jaguar Land Rover, Marks & Spencer and Alibaba. 
Risk associated with our U.K. NOI has been minimized. Today, the U.K. portfolio is 100% leased, has a weighted average lease term of 8 years, has only 11% of leases expiring over the next 18 months and has in-place rents that are roughly 10% below market. 
Let's now turn to Europe development activity. We've had a very prudent approach to development in Europe with a heavy emphasis on build-to-suit. Today, we have a 6.2 million-square-foot development portfolio in Europe, which is 60% leased and is approximately 1,000 basis points ahead of our underwriting. The U.K. portion of our development portfolio totals 1.9 million square feet and is 850 basis points ahead of our underwriting. We also expect to execute 2 leases totaling about 570,000 square feet imminently and have good activity on the balance of our U.K. developments. The only exception is a 317,000 square-foot building in London Gateway, where there has been little activity even before Brexit. 
Turning to capital markets and building sales. We sold a 3-building portfolio in the U.K. during the second quarter, and that transaction closed as planned on June 21, 2 days before the referendum vote. We also began negotiating the sale of EUR 100 million-plus French portfolio pre-Brexit and concluded discussions on Friday of last week with no change to our pricing. The buyers are now under contract with a 10% nonrefundable deposit. 
There has also been some non-Prologis activity to report in the U.K. that underscore solid pricing for logistics assets. 103,000 square-foot building leased to DHL in Birmingham with a 10-year term closed on July 1, at a 4.8% stabilized cap rate, and another 176,000 square-foot building lent to Amazon for 10 years in Manchester is expected to close at about the same level in the next few days. 
In addition, a U.K. retail fund has brought a GBP 50 million British Telecom logistics deal to market, and as active buyers transact in just 5 working days, there are reportedly more than 10 bidders at about a 5% stabilize cap rate, probably 15 to 20 basis points higher than we would normally expect but a very small discount when you consider the timescale and lack of due diligence. Beyond that, we're hearing rumors that certain retail funds may bring assets to market to create liquidity, and we will monitor those for opportunity. 
In general, values in the U.K. are driven by lease length and location, so you shouldn't expect to see any meaningful value change in the Prologis U.K. portfolio given our current lease length location and interest rates that are widely believed to be going lower for longer. 
Lastly, let's turn to our funds. Values are up 70 basis points this quarter in our European funds on incremental leasing and cap rate compression on the continent, but any of these are flat to slightly down given the negative impact of lower interest rates on debt mark-to-market and FX. 
While we don't expect to see significant investment activity during the summer months, and as a result, we don't expect to see much change in fund values, here is what we can tell you as of today. 
Our open-end fund PTELF has a EUR 400 million equity queue, its largest ever. We have closed EUR 70 million in new equity commitments in PTELF as planned on June 30, again, post-Brexit, from a Swiss capital source. Our open funds in Europe are approximately 30% levered, and our JVs are 0% levered, so we have plenty of capital to take advantage of the right opportunity, should they arise. 
On June 30, we had one secondary trade occur in our PEPF II vehicle. It was a EUR 16 million trade at par between a fund that was expiring and an existing PEPF II investor. The at-par trade validates our current fund valuations. 
To date, we have had no formal redemption requests but have heard some noise about 2 Sterling investors with investment totaling about EUR 45 million that may pursue secondary trades. 
So let me quickly summarize. Leasing volume and rent appear to be holding up well. On the development front, we are significantly ahead of our underwritten lease-up, new supply is generally in check and we expect to maintain a high build-to-suit percentage this year. 
While we can't speak to U.K. office or retail, which have their issues, high-quality logistic assets appear to be trading at valuation. And with respect to Prologis funds, we are in great shape with record queues and capacity to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tom to take us through the rest of the quarter."

For the second quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.60 per share, exceeding our forecast due to better-than-expected real estate operations and higher asset management fees. 
Global occupancy was 96.1% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year. We set another quarterly leasing record at 49 million square feet, including more than 9 million square feet of development leasing. 
Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was 17.8%, led by the U.S. at 23.5%. Our share of same-store NOI increased 6.1%, with U.S. leading the way at 7.5%. This is the last quarter that will be impacted by the burn-off of merger lease intangible amortization. Excluding this impact, our share same-store NOI growth for the quarter would have been 5%. 
For the first half of 2016, development stabilizations were $1.1 billion with an estimated weighted average margin of over 26%. Development starts totaled $658 million with an estimated weighted average margin of over 18%. Build-to-suits comprised almost half of our year-to-date starts. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.2 billion. 
In terms of total capital proceeds, we've already closed or have under hard contract about 70% of our original full year guidance. 
Turning to capital markets, our leverage at quarter end was 37% on a book basis and 30.6% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x. Our liquidity, which we defined as our undrawn line capacity and available consolidated cash, reached the highest level in our history this quarter. 
Turning to guidance now for 2016. I'll just cover the material changes so for compete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. 
Due to stronger operating fundamentals, we're increasing our share same-store NOI range to between 4.75% and 5.25%. In light of our progress year-to-date and investor interest, we're increasing our share of disposition and contribution volume to between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, an increase of $300 million at the midpoint. We will complete an additional ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures for a total of $200 million. This is on top of the $400 million we completed earlier this year. We're also raising the midpoint of our share development starts by $200 million for a range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. We expect our full year build-to-suit percentage to be higher than the 44% we did last year. 
The net result of our deployment changes is that we now expect to generate $1.3 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs, up $300 million from prior guidance. We will use a portion of the net proceeds to retire debt, with a balance further building up our cash reserves. We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion and booked leverage below 35%. 
Related to FX, our 2016 and 2017 estimated quarter earnings are fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar, and we have already hedged about half of 2018. 
Putting this all together, our 2016 core FFO, excluding promotes, is higher by $0.03 cents due to better-than-forecasted operations and fees, partially offset by the dilution from an increase and acceleration of the dispositions, contributions and fund rebalancing. In other words, core earnings are higher while, at the same time, significantly increasing our cash reserves. We expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.52 and $2.58 per share, maintaining our $2.55 midpoint. Our promote range is now $0.14 to $0.16 a share, down $0.03 at the midpoint. The decline in the promotes is primarily due to negative debt mark-to-market and FX movements from the pound weakening against the euro. The promote midpoint assumes that asset values remain unchanged with June 30 appraisals and FX rates remain at current levels. To be clear, asset values in Europe have not declined. In fact, the appraised value of our assets in our European ventures increased 70 basis points in the second quarter led by the U.K. at 100 basis points. 
To wrap up, we expect continued strong NOI growth as we harvest the GAAP between in-place and market rents. We're maintaining strong double-digit core FFO growth in 2016 while, at the same time, further strengthening our balance sheet and building liquidity. Our financial position has never been stronger, and it will continue to improve by year-end as we generate additional proceeds from net deployment. 
With that, I'll turn it to -- over to the operator for your questions."

Global trade, which used to run at the about 3X the sum of domestic GDP, has slowed down to about 1.2, 1.3x the size -- the pace of global domestic GDP. It's still going a little bit faster, but as global trade represents a larger and larger percentage of domestic GDP, the math just drives you there. Because when global trade was only 2% of total GDP, it had a lot of opportunity to grow. But once it's reached the saturation level, it's tough to have it grow at the same levels. So part of it is just math and nothing else. Part of it has to do with definitely protectionism and also some exchange rate considerations that affect that patterns of global trade. If global trade is curtailed, which we don't think is going to be the case, we think around every election, there's a lot of talk of protectionism but people know that the people that want protectionism are the very people that actually get hurt by it in the long term. We think notwithstanding the talk around the election season is going to be very little. In fact, we think that CPP is going to go forward and maybe great opportunities in the other direction. So -- but let's assume for a moment that we're all wrong in global and the politicians will get in the way of global trading. Well, you just have to carry more inventory because you're not sourcing to get it from as many places. The big driver is -- the big drivers of demand, though, are consumption fueled by e-commerce and reconfiguration of the supply chain.

We've got a good allocation, appropriate allocation to Europe. A lot of this stuff is based on long-term prospects for economic and population growth. If basically, the -- we are invested the way we are across the world for a reason. Over time, the only portfolio shift that we imagine has nothing to do with Brexit. We probably want to be a little heavier in Asia and a little lighter in Europe, but fundamentally, our allocations, regardless of Brexit, are where we want them to be. So the big dial that we use in terms of managing our own allocation is our share of our private capital vehicles. That's really the way we managed the business from our capital exposure. We like our scale in Europe because we're the dominant player there and have the best portfolio. And we really like that market position and what it means in terms of what we can do with customers.

It might take a pause in the short term, but the long-term dynamics of it are quite interesting. 
So we're good where we are. 
Now if opportunities arise and people start doing stupid things, we would be delighted to take advantage of those things. I don't think it will happen. I think by and large, European real estate is in strong institutional hands. There's not a lot of leverage in the system, notwithstanding the headlines that you hear about some of these open-end funds. And there may be pressure, by the way, on financial center-type office buildings in the U.K. But in our product type, we think there are more buyers than sellers of the quality of product that we have.

We're comfortable with where that is and we've obviously had extremely good dividend growth over the last several years. But we see the dividend holding where it is this year."

I would be surprised if the dividend rate doesn't grow by multiples of inflation going forward. I think we're -- we think our FFO growth is going to be pretty strong and we've got good leverage coming through G&A, which is not growing nearly as fast. It's actually flat compared to our operating earnings. So I think we've got good leverage to grow our dividend above industry rates, pretty clear about that. We are not planning to go to any new markets. In fact, we're in the process of completing our strategic plan vision 2020. And in it, it doesn't contemplate going into any new markets. It's totally based on deepening our presence in the markets we're already in. And with respect to land and replacement cost, I think land in the U.S. has appreciated quite a bit. And I think the constraints on land and its entitlements are significant. And we'll continue to put pressure on some of the most desirable markets in the U.S. like California in the Pacific Northwest and Miami and the like. The markets that are supply-constrained, I think, there's very little land and very tough to get it entitled. So I think replacement costs, rent numbers are going up and up in the U.S. I think land prices have recovered in Europe, but we don't see them zooming ahead because the rents are still relatively slow growing in Europe. They're growing, but they're much slower growing than the U.S. So land has recovered but it's not zooming ahead. In the U.S., land is pretty expensive."

Somebody asked the question earlier about our development volumes in China and, obviously, they're increasing. But each incremental piece of land that we buy in China, even if it's phase 2, is incrementally more expensive than the land that we just acquired right next door. And as a result, you're seeing market rent growth there continuing at 4% to 5% range depending on what submarket you're talking about. And in Japan, probably the most expressive land market in the world, and the other thing that's impacting replacement costs rents are construction costs. Then our teams expect that the back half of this year we're going to start to see construction cost rise again as we approach the 2020 Olympics and construction resources become scarce. So I think Asia is a pretty interesting place with respect to the land market."

One way to think about the -- kind of risking new development program is if you take all your vacant development, no matter what condition it's in, what percentage of your overall portfolio development and operating, what does that represent? And over the last couple of years, when we've really sort of ramp our development up, we've been between 4% and 5%. And as of this quarter, it's 3.5%. So we're -- I think fairly derisk on that front. And then if you look at -- you look at starts on the U.S. for example, and this gets to the customer dialogue, we're 89% pre-leased on the starts this quarter because we had effectively 6 build-to-suits or pre-leased deals. And that's a result of lots and lots of customer dialogue that's taking place over a couple of years at this point. But most of our customers, today their focus is on how do they plan for the future. Most of them are in the midst of a supply chain reconfiguration of some type. And the markets are so tight. They have to plan, they have to engage with us more in long-term planning. And so I think actually that the nature of that dialogue is shifted dramatically. It hasn't shifted just in the last quarter, it's taking some period of time but that's why you see lease terms are significantly longer than they were a couple of years ago. And we'd like to think these discussions are strategic versus transactional. So I think that actually is a pretty significant change that we've seen."

I mean, literally, they're asking us to build more spec product and they are coming ahead and telling us where their needs are. And they used to play their cards pretty close to their vest. Now part of this may be just that level of strategic dialogue that we've created with them I mean, with some of these customers we have 30, 40, 50, 60 leases. You can engage in meaningful dialogue when you have that kind of customer connectivity; whereas if you have a random portfolio and maybe the customer is sprinkled in 3 locations, they think of you more as a vendor than a partner. So I think the business is finally getting to the scale, not only because of its size, but also because of its focus on the key markets that the dialogue is becoming more and more strategic and that's what we work very hard to create. So we're very encouraged by all that. And look to take advantage of it. It manifests itself in very high volumes of build-to-suits, not because we want it to be that way, but because it turns out that way that people want to lock up spec capacity ahead of time. So a lot of these are spec-to-suit or buildings we're going to build anyway that get leased up on a build-to-suit basis before we start with very minor modifications. It's a good place to be."

So we've been surprised by that last 10%, we thought we're being pretty aggressive. You guys thought all of you -- we were crazy. The market it turned out to be much more -- we were all very conservative in retrospect and the market has blown past that because replacement cost that's blown past that. And we shouldn't really be surprised because nominal rent today are only a few percent higher than what they were in 2000. We had a dry period of 10 to 15 years of very little nominal rental growth and now we're finally getting back to nominal rents that we got in the early 2000. On a real basis, we're still 35% below where we should be. I'm not saying we're going to have 35% more rental growth, don't get me wrong, but I'm just saying nominally, where we were 15 years ago we shouldn't be this surprised.

Our portfolio is primarily Northwest and it's pretty built out, there isn't a lot of supply. But if you look at the raw numbers in Houston, it is in an overbuilt condition, it still has positive absorption, which probably surprises a lot of people. But it is overbuilt. Other markets that we've called out Columbus, again not a horrendous situation but they have excess of client and a forward pipeline that concerns us. And otherwise, we look at this all the time as you know, other markets just don't scream bad at this point. Dallas has a lot of construction going on and Dallas has a forward supply scenario that has us sort of cautious. But again, a lot of that's in South Dallas, most of our development, most of our portfolio is around the airport in the north now. So I could go on about other markets but the reality is that we're in pretty good shape in these markets in the U.S. And there's something else I'd point out, Eric, and this is worth noting and watching going forward. We've called out a couple of markets historically over the last several quarters Indianapolis is one of them, Central and Eastern Pennsylvania. And what's happened and frankly, I haven't seen this happen before in my career is we -- markets got closed doing over building situation or maybe a little over the line and they've corrected. So both of those markets are actually -- they've taken the foot of the gas, they'd lowered the supply level and they've made corrections. And there's a couple of other markets but New Jersey would also fall on that category, by the way, that's really, really good to see. And again we got to watch this every day.

Rent change on rollover was 15%, occupancy was up and core FFO grew 26%. Our disposition and contribution activities are tracking ahead of plan and we're developing in markets where there is scarcity of available Class-A product. Of our development projects this year, nearly half are build-to-suits. 
Favorable trends continue to support our operations. While e-commerce is a tailwind, we see broad-based strength in other industry categories such as automotive, consumer products and residential construction. Additionally, customers continue to consolidate operations to improve supply chain efficiencies and move closer to large population centers. Even though global trade growth is converging towards global GDP growth, activities robust in the top markets where our portfolio is focused. 
Market conditions remain very strong. As we survey our global markets, the supply/demand balance is just favorable -- is still favorable and vacancy is near all-time lows. In the U.S., we now forecast 250 million square feet of new demand in 2016 versus our prior view of 225 million square feet. This new demand is driving positive rent change, up 23% last quarter and high occupancies of 97%. 
While the headlines out of Europe this past summer were alarming, our experience on the ground was positive. In the region, occupancy was up and rents increased. Of the total 46 million square feet we leased during the period, a record 35% was in Europe. In the U.K. alone, we leased more than 2 million square feet, an exceptional quarter. Rent change in the U.S. was over 20% and we are 100% occupied. All in all, the U.K. was our second best-performing market globally [ph] after the U.S. 
Conditions in Japan are strong, but because of temporary excess supply, we expect a short-term bump and, traditionally, low vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka. In China. Economic headlines have improved and demand is healthy, especially in Tier 1 markets where our portfolio is focused. While most of our markets are in good shape, risks of oversupply remain in the same cities we called out last quarter, in particular, South Dallas and Houston. Separately, we continue to monitor Poland closely. Merchant builders there have used excessive concessions as a way to inflate headline rents before selling to investors. Recently, however, there have been instances where investors have shown better restraint and underlying -- underwriting. This is welcome news but more buyer discipline is required before the market normalizes. 
Looking ahead, we're ready for a world of rising interest rates. Eventually, this will happen. And when it does, it will likely signal improving macro and consumer demand, which is good for our business. Higher rates also mean higher financing costs for our new developments, which favor the larger institutional players. In our case, however, we have plenty of capital to fund growth on our own. 
Lastly, since spreads between the 10-year yield and GAAP rates are wider than normal, we don't believe modestly higher rates will affect cap rates materially in the long term. Still, we know rate hikes will hit REIT stocks in the short-term as a knee-jerk reaction. We see several years of strong earnings growth ahead. With our work on the balance sheet complete and our stronger than ever liquidity, we're now entirely focused on delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. 
Our leasing portfolio is 12% under rented. This will drive rental growth for several years even under a scenario of flattening market rents going forward. Also supporting our growth story, we own land in key strategic locations. So look for us to continue developing in the world's busiest consumption markets. In short, our team is doing a great job. We look forward to reporting to you more detail at our investor forum on November 9 in New York. Tom?"

For the third quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by outperformance in our real estate operations and $0.14 of net promotes from 2 of our European ventures. Global occupancy was 96.6% at quarter end, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Europe's occupancy was 96.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over the same time period. Quarterly leasing volume remained very good at 46 million square feet, with a record 41 million from our operating portfolio. Year-to-date, we've leased over 141 million square feet as our best-in-class portfolio is more critical than ever to our customer supply chain needs. 
Our share net effective rent change on rollover was 15% led by the U.S. at over 23% for the second consecutive quarter. However, we did see a sequential decrease in our share of rent change, driven by a higher mix of leasing in Europe and Asia this quarter. Our share of same-store NOI increased 5.6% with the U.S. leading the way at 6.9%. The pace of net deployment activity continues to be faster than our forecast. Year-to-date through the third quarter, development stabilizations totaled $1.5 billion with an estimated margin of 28%. Development starts totaled $1.1 billion with an estimated margin of over 18% and value creation of almost $200 million. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.7 billion at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.1%. 
Turning to capital markets. On a look-through basis, our leverage at quarter end was 28.8% on market capitalization and 37% on a book basis. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x and our liquidity was over $3.8 billion. We completed an opportunistic refinancing of 3 yen loans during the quarter, totaling $1.2 billion. The term for the new financing is just under 7 years with a current interest rate of 65 basis points. 
At quarter end, our share of debt had 5.2 years of average remaining term and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%, following a paydown over a multicurrency term loan post quarter end, 86% of our debt is fixed with nearly all of our floating rate debt being yen-denominated. Moving to 2016 guidance. I'll cover just the material changes on a Prologis share basis. So for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. 
Due to continued strong operating fundamentals, we're increasing same-store NOI growth to between 5.5% and 5.8%, up 65 basis points from our prior guidance. Development stabilizations have come in ahead of forecast given our strong leasing activity. And as a result, we're increasing the range to between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. We're increasing the low end and midpoint disposition and contribution volume, which we now expect to range between $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion. 
We're also raising development starts to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion with build-to-suits representing over 45% of this volume. And we're also increasing our development gains range to between $275 million and $300 million. The net results of our deployment changes is that we expect to generate $100 million more net proceeds than previously expected, resulting in a cash surplus of $1.4 billion. As a reminder, this includes over $800 million of cash from fund ownership rebalancings and a Facebook note proceeds, all of which have already been completed. 
We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion. Market leverage at about 27%, book leverage below 35% and debt-to-EBITDA with gains of about 5x. Related to FX. Our 2016 and 2017 estimated core FFO continues to be fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged about half of 2018. Net promotes for the full year are forecasted at $0.15, with the remaining $0.01 coming in the fourth quarter. Putting this altogether, we expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.56 and $2.57 a share. The increase of $0.015 from our prior guidance midpoint is due to stronger operations, offset by additional dilution from higher liquidity. 
To wrap up. We're delivering 15% core FFO growth this year, in line with our 3-year CAGR of 16%, while at the same time, improving our portfolio, building liquidity, and further strengthening our balance sheet. Our portfolio quality and financial strength have never been better. This puts us in a great position to continue to realize strong operating results, driven by the gap between in-place and market rents and to fund our growth. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

I think you'll get a pretty good view of what we think at the investor forum. But at a very general level, I am feeling better about our business than I did a year ago because demand exceeds certainly in the U.S. what we expected a year ago. If I were really looking for a potential negative, I would say that we are further along in capturing the spreads between in-place rents and market rents from the low levels of post-financial crisis. But I fully expect our same-store numbers to be very much in line with what we are seeing this year. We have less opportunity, obviously, on the occupancy side. But I think the rent side of the equation will be the same or may be a little bit better. So generally feel very good about the business. In terms of the sector issue, let me give you sort of an essay answer. This is more complicated in our sector than you would think because there are really 3 different things going on when you talk about customers. One is you're talking about what industry sector they're in. Let's take BMW as an example. You could have a manufacturing facility leased to BMW. You can have a parts facility or you could have sort of a wholesale operation, which is distribution of cars. Those all would show up as automotive, but there are definitely different functions. If you take that concept to a retailer, it gets even more complicated because they can be bricks and mortar retail or they can be e-commerce retail, but they're a retailer. So really, there are 3 things we track without over complicating this is the industry sector of the tenant, in the case of BMW automotive; the actual use of the space, whether it's manufacturing or distribution or whatever; and then the modality. Is it a 3PL? Is it a direct user facility, et cetera, et cetera. So as you can see, this is a complicated thing. And because of the 3PLs, we don't always have visibility through what the underlying businesses that they do because sometimes, it changes. So when we coach you for example statistics on e-commerce, that's really understating the contribution of e-commerce because we don't really know how much of that UPS building is e-commerce. And we classify UPS as an integrated logistic company. So again, it's complicated. But I will tell you, looking through all of that, the things that stand out is that housing is really picking up by a couple of 100,000 units. And that's adding incremental demand, which is really what took occupancies from 96% to 97% in the U.S. I mean that -- if we're ever going to call out one thing in addition to e-commerce, it will be that. Automotive is also very strong but not as strong as the change on the margin of residential. Anyway, that's how we see it."

You saw -- in the early stages of the recovery, we saw a lot of big-box development and a lot of absorption by Amazon and others with very, very big floor plates. What happened during the last 5 or 6 years is that the vacancy rates in smaller size increments have really tightened up. So you see more deliveries in sort of medium- to small-size ranges. And frankly, we're doing the same. So are you going to see an odd deal that is misplaced? You probably will. But I think by and large, most of these projects are well suited.

[Audio Gap]
I don't think Amazon -- first of all, you're going to have to ask them. I don't have any insight into their long-range plan. Secondly, if you look at their multiple, and the expected growth that's associated with that, if they tie up a bunch of their balance sheet and warehouses or other facilities, that's not exactly what the market is giving them. That capital has a very high multiple for us. So I think what they said publicly is that they are doing the investments in logistics and airplanes and all that kind of stuff by the way, which they're all leasing to supplement the volume that they get out of UPS and FedEx. And particularly, over a very busy holiday season because a couple of years ago, you remember there were some complications with some of the deliveries that they felt hurt their brand. So that's what they are saying at least publicly from there point of your Capital Markets point of you would be a really terrible use of capital for them, I would think.

She did a pretty good job on your name [indiscernible]. Look, land is all over the place and the reasons for it is that rents are already over the place and essentially, the way to think about it and you know this as a real estate developer. The building cuts are not that different between different regions. They're a little different because of the union and all that, but maybe they vary 20% in the U.S. But rents vary by a lot more than that. And all of the difference falls to the residual, which is the land. So rents are higher and building costs are -- rents are higher by 10%, 20% and building costs are the same. Land could be 50%, 70% higher from 1 location compared to the other. And then when you get into Bay Area and some of the anomalies, obviously the differences can really magnify. Secondly, as you pointed out, there's a big difference between land that is improved versus land that is still in raw condition. We have very little on entitled land, I mean, like tiny, tiny on entitled land it. So all of it is entitled, but not all of it is actually [indiscernible] because it would be to put in the improvement far ahead on larger parks. So I think at the end of the day, what you need to look at -- and we're not providing that because that's a pro forma number. I get to do a lot of assumptions.

And I think you've heard me talk about this before. If you really think about the market being sort of in the long-term, 1.5% to 2% inflation and bonds are 200% -- 200 basis point premium, that's argues for 3.5% to 4% treasury in the long-term, which is quite a ways from where we are here. And that, consistent with 5.5-ish type cap rates in our sector, makes sense in the historical context and probably 6.5%, 7% IRRs. I mean that's an appropriate spread over 10 years treasury. So I think nobody's paying for real estate as if, 10-year treasuries are going to be 1.8% or whatever they are today into the future. And I think the way to think about it is that investors in the short-term are getting a windfall because they're really pricing against much higher treasuries and collecting the bones that's in the short-term.

I think the world has become such a big macro things and they're like 28 zillion [ph] people watching the same screen, and what some Fed governors says at lunch one day. I mean, I just don't know. I don't borrow. We don't borrow at the Feds fund rate, so whether it goes up or down 25 basis points, I don't really know. All I can tell you is that the last time they increased the Fed funds rate, the 10-year treasury went down. So what we care about actually got cheaper. But I'm not a market psychologist. So I'll leave that to others to explain the knee-jerk reaction. But that's what happens. REITs selloff and then 6 months later because of the stronger economy, which is beyond the underlying cause of rates going up, it starts showing up in rents and they recover. And that's what historical fact has said. In terms of fund demand. I would tell you that we have infinite fund demand in Europe. And in the U.S., funded demand is good. But I would say, it's a little bit less than it was a year ago or 2 years ago. But it's still pretty solid.

And the stabilization is the earlier achievement of 90% occupancy for a development project or a year from certain certificate of occupancy, right? So whether it's leases or not, it goes into the operating pool after a year, and then it goes to the operating pool sooner than that when it hits 90%. So their occupancies we report are the occupancies for the operating portfolio. And separately, we report occupancy for the development portfolio. So our same-store numbers are not boosted artificially by simply the lease up of the development business. I know some other companies do with a different way. I'm not going to pass judgment on that.

I wish that we would talk about more strategic things like that in these calls. I would say, if I were thinking about it then the 3 objectives that we have for the Analyst Meeting is to show you how after massive work, following the merger back in 2011, the business has been really simplified and there's lots of big moving pieces that have now all settled down and you can really tell what's going on with Prologis based on good old real estate metrics so cap rates and same-store growth and so I think there's a perception out there that Prologis is overly complicated. And I think we'd like people to appreciate how simplified we've made the business. So that's objective number one. Objective number 2 is to show people that what the real drivers of supply demand our. How they are different and why we have a good business with strong prospects for earning growth in the long-term, and thank you a couple of players under the surface on those concept and actually bring some third-party resources that can talk a -- speak about the market, financing market as well as real estate markets. And really, how customers think and behave. So that's the second thing. And the third thing is that we get a lot of questions on why global and why development then why all this kind of stuff. And they're all related. And we want people to walk away with a better appreciation of the different components of our business and how they all fit together and how they energize one another. So if we can get those 3 key concepts across, I think we would call it a successful meeting."

Rent change on rollover was 15%, occupancy was up and core FFO grew 26%. Our disposition and contribution activities are tracking ahead of plan and we're developing in markets where there is scarcity of available Class-A product. Of our development projects this year, nearly half are build-to-suits. 
Favorable trends continue to support our operations. While e-commerce is a tailwind, we see broad-based strength in other industry categories such as automotive, consumer products and residential construction. Additionally, customers continue to consolidate operations to improve supply chain efficiencies and move closer to large population centers. Even though global trade growth is converging towards global GDP growth, activities robust in the top markets where our portfolio is focused. 
Market conditions remain very strong. As we survey our global markets, the supply/demand balance is just favorable -- is still favorable and vacancy is near all-time lows. In the U.S., we now forecast 250 million square feet of new demand in 2016 versus our prior view of 225 million square feet. This new demand is driving positive rent change, up 23% last quarter and high occupancies of 97%. 
While the headlines out of Europe this past summer were alarming, our experience on the ground was positive. In the region, occupancy was up and rents increased. Of the total 46 million square feet we leased during the period, a record 35% was in Europe. In the U.K. alone, we leased more than 2 million square feet, an exceptional quarter. Rent change in the U.S. was over 20% and we are 100% occupied. All in all, the U.K. was our second best-performing market globally after the U.S. 
Conditions in Japan are strong, but because of temporary excess supply, we expect a short-term bump and, traditionally, low vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka. In China. Economic headlines have improved and demand is healthy, especially in Tier 1 markets where our portfolio is focused. While most of our markets are in good shape, risks of oversupply remain in the same cities we called out last quarter, in particular, South Dallas and Houston. Separately, we continue to monitor Poland closely. Merchant builders there have used excessive concessions as a way to inflate headline rents before selling to investors. Recently, however, there have been instances where investors have shown better restraint and underlying -- underwriting. This is welcome news but more buyer discipline is required before the market normalizes. 
Looking ahead, we're ready for a world of rising interest rates. Eventually, this will happen. And when it does, it will likely signal improving macro and consumer demand, which is good for our business. Higher rates also mean higher financing costs for our new developments, which favor the larger institutional players. In our case, however, we have plenty of capital to fund growth on our own. 
Lastly, since spreads between the 10-year yield and GAAP rates are wider than normal, we don't believe modestly higher rates will affect cap rates materially in the long term. Still, we know rate hikes will hit REIT stocks in the short-term as a knee-jerk reaction. We see several years of strong earnings growth ahead. With our work on the balance sheet complete and our stronger than ever liquidity, we're now entirely focused on delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. 
Our leasing portfolio is 12% under rented. This will drive rental growth for several years even under a scenario of flattening market rents going forward. Also supporting our growth story, we own land in key strategic locations. So look for us to continue developing in the world's busiest consumption markets. In short, our team is doing a great job. We look forward to reporting to you more detail at our investor forum on November 9 in New York. Tom?"

For the third quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by outperformance in our real estate operations and $0.14 of net promotes from 2 of our European ventures. Global occupancy was 96.6% at quarter end, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Europe's occupancy was 96.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over the same time period. Quarterly leasing volume remained very good at 46 million square feet, with a record 41 million from our operating portfolio. Year-to-date, we've leased over 141 million square feet as our best-in-class portfolio is more critical than ever to our customer supply chain needs. 
Our share net effective rent change on rollover was 15% led by the U.S. at over 23% for the second consecutive quarter. However, we did see a sequential decrease in our share of rent change, driven by a higher mix of leasing in Europe and Asia this quarter. Our share of same-store NOI increased 5.6% with the U.S. leading the way at 6.9%. The pace of net deployment activity continues to be faster than our forecast. Year-to-date through the third quarter, development stabilizations totaled $1.5 billion with an estimated margin of 28%. Development starts totaled $1.1 billion with an estimated margin of over 18% and value creation of almost $200 million. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.7 billion at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.1%. 
Turning to capital markets. On a look-through basis, our leverage at quarter end was 28.8% on market capitalization and 37% on a book basis. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x and our liquidity was over $3.8 billion. We completed an opportunistic refinancing of 3 yen loans during the quarter, totaling $1.2 billion. The term for the new financing is just under 7 years with a current interest rate of 65 basis points. 
At quarter end, our share of debt had 5.2 years of average remaining term and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%, following a paydown over a multicurrency term loan post quarter end, 86% of our debt is fixed with nearly all of our floating rate debt being yen-denominated. Moving to 2016 guidance. I'll cover just the material changes on a Prologis share basis. So for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. 
Due to continued strong operating fundamentals, we're increasing same-store NOI growth to between 5.5% and 5.8%, up 65 basis points from our prior guidance. Development stabilizations have come in ahead of forecast given our strong leasing activity. And as a result, we're increasing the range to between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. We're increasing the low end and midpoint disposition and contribution volume, which we now expect to range between $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion. 
We're also raising development starts to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion with build-to-suits representing over 45% of this volume. And we're also increasing our development gains range to between $275 million and $300 million. The net results of our deployment changes is that we expect to generate $100 million more net proceeds than previously expected, resulting in a cash surplus of $1.4 billion. As a reminder, this includes over $800 million of cash from fund ownership rebalancings and a Facebook note proceeds, all of which have already been completed. 
We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion. Market leverage at about 27%, book leverage below 35% and debt-to-EBITDA with gains of about 5x. Related to FX. Our 2016 and 2017 estimated core FFO continues to be fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged about half of 2018. Net promotes for the full year are forecasted at $0.15, with the remaining $0.01 coming in the fourth quarter. Putting this altogether, we expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.56 and $2.57 a share. The increase of $0.015 from our prior guidance midpoint is due to stronger operations, offset by additional dilution from higher liquidity. 
To wrap up. We're delivering 15% core FFO growth this year, in line with our 3-year CAGR of 16%, while at the same time, improving our portfolio, building liquidity, and further strengthening our balance sheet. Our portfolio quality and financial strength have never been better. This puts us in a great position to continue to realize strong operating results, driven by the gap between in-place and market rents and to fund our growth. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

I think you'll get a pretty good view of what we think at the investor forum. But at a very general level, I am feeling better about our business than I did a year ago because demand exceeds certainly in the U.S. what we expected a year ago. If I were really looking for a potential negative, I would say that we are further along in capturing the spreads between in-place rents and market rents from the low levels of post-financial crisis. But I fully expect our same-store numbers to be very much in line with what we are seeing this year. We have less opportunity, obviously, on the occupancy side. But I think the rent side of the equation will be the same or may be a little bit better. So generally feel very good about the business. In terms of the sector issue, let me give you sort of an essay answer. This is more complicated in our sector than you would think because there are really 3 different things going on when you talk about customers. One is you're talking about what industry sector they're in. Let's take BMW as an example. You could have a manufacturing facility leased to BMW. You can have a parts facility or you could have sort of a wholesale operation, which is distribution of cars. Those all would show up as automotive, but there are definitely different functions. If you take that concept to a retailer, it gets even more complicated because they can be bricks and mortar retail or they can be e-commerce retail, but they're a retailer. So really, there are 3 things we track without over complicating this is the industry sector of the tenant, in the case of BMW automotive; the actual use of the space, whether it's manufacturing or distribution or whatever; and then the modality. Is it a 3PL? Is it a direct user facility, et cetera, et cetera. So as you can see, this is a complicated thing. And because of the 3PLs, we don't always have visibility through what the underlying businesses that they do because sometimes, it changes. So when we coach you for example statistics on e-commerce, that's really understating the contribution of e-commerce because we don't really know how much of that UPS building is e-commerce. And we classify UPS as an integrated logistic company. So again, it's complicated. But I will tell you, looking through all of that, the things that stand out is that housing is really picking up by a couple of 100,000 units. And that's adding incremental demand, which is really what took occupancies from 96% to 97% in the U.S. I mean that -- if we're ever going to call out one thing in addition to e-commerce, it will be that. Automotive is also very strong but not as strong as the change on the margin of residential. Anyway, that's how we see it."

What happened during the last 5 or 6 years is that the vacancy rates in smaller size increments have really tightened up. So you see more deliveries in sort of medium- to small-size ranges. And frankly, we're doing the same. So are you going to see an odd deal that is misplaced? You probably will. But I think by and large, most of these projects are well suited. And overall, of course, there's still tremendous excess demand in the system."

So look, land varies all over the place and the reasons for it is that rents vary all over the place. And essentially, the way to think about it, and you know this as a real estate developer, the building cuts are not that different between different regions. They're a little different because of the union and all that, but maybe they vary 20% in the U.S. But rents vary by a lot more than that. And all of the difference falls to the residual, which is the land. So if rents are higher and building costs are -- rents are higher by 10%, 20% and building costs are the same, land could be 50%, 70% higher from one location compared to the other. And then when you get into Bay Area and some of the anomalies, obviously the differences get really magnified. Secondly, as you pointed out, there's a big difference between land that is improved versus land that is still in raw condition. We have very little on entitled land, I mean, like tiny, tiny on entitled land.

I think the world has become such a big macro things and there are like 28 zillion people watching the same screen, and what some Fed governor says at lunch one day. I mean I just don't know. I don't borrow. We don't borrow at the Feds fund rate, so whether it goes up or down 25 basis points, I don't really know. All I can tell you is that the last time they increased the Fed funds rate, the 10-year treasury went down. So what we care about actually got cheaper. But I'm not a market psychologist, so I'll leave that to others to explain the knee-jerk reaction. But that's what happens. REITs fell off and then 6 months later, because of the stronger economy, which is the underlying cause of rates going up, it starts showing up in rents and they recover. And that's what historical facts has said. In terms of fund demand. I would tell you that we have infinite fund demand in Europe. And in the U.S., fund demand is good. But I would say, it's a little bit less than it was a year ago or 2 years ago. But it's still pretty solid. I think the numbers will end up being smaller in terms of new money allocated this year than last year when it's all over."

I know some companies, when they report occupancies, they report overall occupancy, including their underdevelopment stuff that is not fully leased or stabilized. We don't do that. When we operate, we have a definition of stabilization. And the stabilization is the earlier achievement of 90% occupancy for a development project or a year from certificate of occupancy, right? So whether it leases or not, it goes into the operating pool after a year, and it goes into the operating pool sooner than that when it hits 90%. So the occupancies we report are the occupancies for the operating portfolio. And separately, we report the occupancy for the development portfolio. So our same-store numbers are not boosted artificially by simply the lease up of the development business. I know some other companies do it a different way. I'm not going to pass judgment on that. But I don't think it reflects as accurately the same-store concept of stabilized properties."

Yes, we do have a lot going on in the fourth quarter. But it's definitely ahead of our forecast. And that is also a slight drag on earnings.

I wish that we would talk about more strategic things like that in these calls. I would say, if I were thinking about it, the 3 objectives that we have for the Analyst Meeting is to show you how after massive work, following the merger back in 2011, the business has been really simplified and there are lots of big moving pieces that have now all settled down and you can really tell what's going on with Prologis based on good old real estate metrics of cap rates and same-store growth. And so I think there's a perception out there that Prologis is overly complicated, and I think we'd like people to appreciate how simplified we've made the business. So that's objective #1. Objective #2 is to show people that what the real drivers of supply and demand are. How they are different and why we have a good business with strong prospects for earning growth in the long term, and take you a couple of layers under the surface on those concepts and actually bring some third-party resources that can talk -- speak about the market, financing market as well as real estate markets. And really, how customers think and behave. So that's the second thing. And the third thing is that we get a lot of questions on why global and why development and why all this kind of stuff. And they're all related. And we want people to walk away with a better appreciation of the different components of our business and how they all fit together and how they energize one another.

Rent change on rollover was 15%, occupancy was up and core FFO grew 26%. Our disposition and contribution activities are tracking ahead of plan and we're developing in markets where there is scarcity of available Class-A product. Of our development projects this year, nearly half are build-to-suits. 
Favorable trends continue to support our operations. While e-commerce is a tailwind, we see broad-based strength in other industry categories such as automotive, consumer products and residential construction. Additionally, customers continue to consolidate operations to improve supply chain efficiencies and move closer to large population centers. Even though global trade growth is converging towards global GDP growth, activity is robust in the top markets where our portfolio is focused. 
Market conditions remain very strong. As we survey our global markets, the supply/demand balance is just favorable -- is still favorable and vacancy is near all-time lows. In the U.S., we now forecast 250 million square feet of new demand in 2016 versus our prior view of 225 million square feet. This new demand is driving positive rent change, up 23% last quarter and high occupancies of 97%. 
While the headlines out of Europe this past summer were alarming, our experience on the ground was positive. In the region, occupancy was up and rents increased. Of the total 46 million square feet we leased during the period, a record 35% was in Europe. In the U.K. alone, we leased more than 2 million square feet, an exceptional quarter. Rent change in the U.K. was over 20% and we are 100% occupied. All in all, the U.K. was our second best-performing market globally after the U.S. 
Conditions in Japan are strong, but because of temporary excess supply, we expect a short-term bump in traditionally low vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka. In China. Economic headlines have improved and demand is healthy, especially in Tier 1 markets where our portfolio is focused. While most of our markets are in good shape, risks of oversupply remain in the same cities we called out last quarter, in particular, South Dallas and Houston. Separately, we continue to monitor Poland closely. Merchant builders there have used excessive concessions as a way to inflate headline rents before selling to investors. Recently, however, there have been instances where investors have shown better restraint in underlying -- underwriting. This is welcome news but more buyer discipline is required before the market normalizes. 
Looking ahead, we're ready for a world of rising interest rates. Eventually this will happen, and when it does, it will likely signal improving macro and consumer demand, which is good for our business. Higher rates also mean higher financing costs for our new developments, which favor the larger institutional players. In our case, however, we have plenty of capital to fund growth on our own. 
Lastly, since spreads between the 10-year yield and GAAP rates are wider than normal, we don't believe modestly higher rates will affect cap rates materially in the long term. Still, we know rate hikes will hit REIT stocks in the short-term as a knee-jerk reaction. We see several years of strong earnings growth ahead. With our work on the balance sheet complete and our stronger than ever liquidity, we're now entirely focused on delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. 
Our leasing portfolio is 12% under rented. This will drive rental growth for several years even under a scenario of flattening market rents going forward. Also supporting our growth story, we own land in key strategic locations. So look for us to continue developing in the world's busiest consumption markets. In short, our team is doing a great job. We look forward to reporting to you in more detail at our investor forum on November 9 in New York. Tom?"

For the third quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by outperformance in our real estate operations and $0.14 of net promotes from 2 of our European ventures. Global occupancy was 96.6% at quarter end, up 60 basis points",739,"Thanks, Hamid. For the third quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by outperformance in our real estate operations and $0.14 of net promotes from 2 of our European ventures. Global occupancy was 96.6% at quarter end, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Europe's occupancy was 96.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over the same time period. Quarterly leasing volume remained very good at 46 million square feet, with a record 41 million from our operating portfolio. Year-to-date, we've leased over 141 million square feet, as our best-in-class portfolio is more critical than ever to our customer supply chain needs. 
Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was 15% led by the U.S. at over 23% for the second consecutive quarter. However, we did see a sequential decrease in our share of rent change, driven by a higher mix of leasing in Europe and Asia this quarter. Our share of same-store NOI increased 5.6% with the U.S. leading the way at 6.9%. The pace of net deployment activity continues to be faster than our forecast. Year-to-date through the third quarter, development stabilizations totaled $1.5 billion with an estimated margin of 28%. Development starts totaled $1.1 billion with an estimated margin of over 18% and value creation of almost $200 million. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.7 billion at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.1%. 
Turning to capital markets. On a look-through basis, our leverage at quarter end was 28.8% on market capitalization and 37% on a book basis. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x and our liquidity was over $3.8 billion. We completed an opportunistic refinancing of 3 yen loans during the quarter, totaling $1.2 billion. The term for the new financing is just under 7 years with a current interest rate of 65 basis points. 
At quarter end, our share of debt had 5.2 years of average remaining term and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. Following a paydown over a multicurrency term loan post quarter end, 86% of our debt is fixed with nearly all of our floating rate debt being yen-denominated. Moving to 2016 guidance. I'll cover just the material changes on a Prologis share basis. So for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. 
Due to continued strong operating fundamentals, we're increasing same-store NOI growth to between 5.5% and 5.8%, up 65 basis points from our prior guidance. Development stabilizations have come in ahead of forecast given our strong leasing activity, and, as a result, we're increasing the range to between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. We're increasing the low end and midpoint disposition and contribution volume, which we now expect to range between $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion. 
We're also raising development starts to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion with build-to-suits representing over 45% of this volume. And we're also increasing our development gains range to between $275 million and $300 million. The net results of our deployment changes is that we expect to generate $100 million more net proceeds than previously expected, resulting in a cash surplus of $1.4 billion. As a reminder, this includes over $800 million of cash from fund ownership rebalancings and the Facebook note proceeds, all of which have already been completed. 
We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion, market leverage at about 27%, book leverage below 35% and debt-to-EBITDA with gains of about 5x. Related to FX. Our 2016 and 2017 estimated core FFO continues to be fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged about half of 2018. Net promotes for the full year are forecasted at $0.15, with the remaining $0.01 coming in the fourth quarter. Putting this altogether, we expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.56 and $2.57 a share. The increase of $0.015 from our prior guidance midpoint is due to stronger operations, offset by additional dilution from higher liquidity. 
To wrap up. We're delivering 15% core FFO growth this year, in line with our 3-year CAGR of 16%, while at the same time improving our portfolio, building liquidity and further strengthening our balance sheet. Our portfolio quality and financial strength have never been better. This puts us in a great position to continue to realize strong operating results driven by the gap between in-place and market rents and to fund our growth. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

In terms of 2017, I think you'll get a pretty good view of what we think at the investor forum. But at a very general level, I am feeling better about our business than I did 1 year ago because demand exceeds certainly in the U.S. what we expected 1 year ago. If I were really looking for a potential negative, I would say that we are further along in capturing the spreads between in-place rents and market rents from the low levels of post-financial crisis. But I fully expect our same-store numbers to be very much in line with what we are seeing this year. We have less opportunity, obviously, on the occupancy side. But I think the rent side of the equation will be the same or maybe a little bit better. So I generally feel very good about the business. In terms of the sector issue, let me give you sort of an essay answer. This is more complicated in our sector than you would think because there are really 3 different things going on when you talk about customers. One is you're talking about what industry sector they're in. Let's take BMW as an example. You could have a manufacturing facility leased to BMW. You can have a parts facility or you could have sort of a wholesale operation, which is distribution of cars. Those all would show up as automotive, but there are definitely different functions. If you take that concept to a retailer, it gets even more complicated because they can be bricks and mortar retail or they can be e-commerce retail, but they're a retailer. So really, the 3 things we track, without over complicating this, is the industry sector of the tenant, in the case of BMW automotive; the actual use of the space, whether it's manufacturing or distribution or whatever; and then the modality. Is it a 3PL? Is it a direct user facility, et cetera, et cetera. So as you can see, this is a complicated thing. And because of the 3PLs, we don't always have visibility through what the underlying businesses that they do, because sometimes it changes. So when we quote you for example statistics on e-commerce, that's really understating the contribution of e-commerce because we don't really know how much of that UPS building is e-commerce. And we classify UPS as an integrated logistic company. So again, it's complicated. But I will tell you, looking through all of that, the things that stand out is that housing is really picking up by a couple of 100,000 units, and that's adding incremental demand, which is really what took occupancies from 96% to 97% in the U.S. I mean that -- if I were going to call out one thing in addition to e-commerce, it would be that. Automotive is also very strong but not as strong as the change on the margin of residential. Anyway, that's how we see it."

What happened during the last 5 or 6 years is that the vacancy rates in smaller size increments have really tightened up. So you see more deliveries in sort of medium- to small-size ranges. And frankly, we're doing the same. So are you going to see an odd deal that is misplaced? You probably will. But I think by and large, most of these projects are well suited. And overall, of course, there's still tremendous excess demand in the system."

So I think what they've said publicly is that they are doing the investments in logistics and airplanes and all that kind of stuff, by the way which they're all leasing, to supplement the volume that they get out of UPS and FedEx. And particularly, over a very busy holiday season because a couple of years ago, you remember that there were some complications with some of the deliveries that they felt hurt their brand. So that's what they're saying, at least publicly. But from a financing point of view and a capital markets point of view, it would be a really terrible use of capital for them, I would think. So let's leave it at that."

So look, land varies all over the place and the reasons for it is that rents vary all over the place. And essentially, the way to think about it, and you know this as a real estate developer, the building costs are not that different between different regions. They're a little different because of the unions and all that, but maybe they vary 20% in the U.S. But rents vary by a lot more than that. And all of the difference falls to the residual, which is the land. So if rents are higher and building costs are -- rents are higher by 10%, 20% and building costs are the same, land could be 50%, 70% higher from one location compared to the other. And then when you get into Bay Area and some of the anomalies, obviously the differences get really magnified. Secondly, as you pointed out, there's a big difference between land that is improved versus land that is still in raw condition. We have very little on unentitled land, I mean, like tiny, tiny on unentitled land. So all of it is entitled, but not all of it is actually improved because it would imprudent to put in the improvement too far ahead on larger parks. So I think at the end of the day, what you need to look at -- and we're not providing that because that's a pro forma number that gets into a lot of assumptions. You want to really look at finished land per FAR. And that's really the true measure that we look at. And I think that's really correlated with rents less development costs. As to any of those specific markets, Gene, do you want to comment?"

Well, the spreads, as I talked about, between cap rates and probably more accurately, IRRs, projected IRRs and the 10-year treasury are the widest they've ever been. And if you -- I think you've heard me talk about this before. If you really think about the market being sort of in the long-term, 1.5% to 2% inflation and bonds are 200% -- 200 basis point premium, that sort of argues for a 3.5% to 4% treasury in the long term, which is quite a ways from where we are here. And that, consistent with 5.5-ish type cap rates in our sector, makes sense in a historical context and probably 6.5%, 7% IRRs. I mean that's an appropriate spread over a 10-year treasury. So I think nobody's paying for real estate as if 10-year treasuries are going to be 1.8% or whatever they are today into the future. And I think the way to think about it is that investors in the short-term are getting a windfall because they're really pricing against much higher treasuries and collecting the bonus in the short term. I don't know why there's so much focus on the Feds fund rate. I think the world has become such a big macro things and there are like 28 zillion people watching the same screen, and what some Fed governor says at lunch one day. I mean I just don't know. I don't borrow. We don't borrow at the Feds fund rate, so whether it goes up or down 25 basis points, I don't really know. All I can tell you is that the last time they increased the Fed funds rate, the 10-year treasury went down. So what we care about actually got cheaper. But I'm not a market psychologist, so I'll leave that to others to explain the knee-jerk reaction. But that's what happens. REITs fell off and then 6 months later, because of the stronger economy, which is the underlying cause of rates going up, it starts showing up in rents and they recover. And that's what historical facts have said. In terms of fund demand. I would tell you that we have infinite fund demand in Europe. And in the U.S., fund demand is good. But I would say it's a little bit less than it was 1 year ago or 2 years ago. But it's still pretty solid. I think the numbers will end up being smaller in terms of new money allocated this year than last year when it's all over."

I know some companies, when they report occupancies, they report overall occupancy, including their underdevelopment stuff that is not fully leased or stabilized. We don't do that. When we operate, we have a definition of stabilization. And the stabilization is the earlier achievement of 90% occupancy for a development project or 1 year from certificate of occupancy, right? So whether it leases or not, it goes into the operating pool after 1 year, and it goes into the operating pool sooner than that when it hits 90%. So the occupancies we report are the occupancies for the operating portfolio, and separately we report the occupancy for the development portfolio. So our same-store numbers are not boosted artificially by simply the lease up of the development business. I know some other companies do it a different way. I'm not going to pass judgment on that. But I don't think it reflects as accurately the same-store concept of stabilized properties."

Rent change on rollover was 15%, occupancy was up and core FFO grew 26%. Our disposition and contribution activities are tracking ahead of plan and we're developing in markets where there is scarcity of available Class-A product. Of our development projects this year, nearly half are build-to-suits. 
Favorable trends continue to support our operations. While e-commerce is a tailwind, we see broad-based strength in other industry categories such as automotive, consumer products and residential construction. Additionally, customers continue to consolidate operations to improve supply chain efficiencies and move closer to large population centers. Even though global trade growth is converging towards global GDP growth, activity is robust in the top markets where our portfolio is focused. 
Market conditions remain very strong. As we survey our global markets, the supply/demand balance is just favorable -- is still favorable and vacancy is near all-time lows. In the U.S., we now forecast 250 million square feet of new demand in 2016 versus our prior view of 225 million square feet. This new demand is driving positive rent change, up 23% last quarter and high occupancies of 97%. 
While the headlines out of Europe this past summer were alarming, our experience on the ground was positive. In the region, occupancy was up and rents increased. Of the total 46 million square feet we leased during the period, a record 35% was in Europe. In the U.K. alone, we leased more than 2 million square feet, an exceptional quarter. Rent change in the U.K. was over 20% and we are 100% occupied. All in all, the U.K. was our second best-performing market globally after the U.S. 
Conditions in Japan are strong, but because of temporary excess supply, we expect a short-term bump in traditionally low vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka. In China. Economic headlines have improved and demand is healthy, especially in Tier 1 markets where our portfolio is focused. While most of our markets are in good shape, risks of oversupply remain in the same cities we called out last quarter, in particular, South Dallas and Houston. Separately, we continue to monitor Poland closely. Merchant builders there have used excessive concessions as a way to inflate headline rents before selling to investors. Recently, however, there have been instances where investors have shown better restraint in underlying -- underwriting. This is welcome news but more buyer discipline is required before the market normalizes. 
Looking ahead, we're ready for a world of rising interest rates. Eventually this will happen, and when it does, it will likely signal improving macro and consumer demand, which is good for our business. Higher rates also mean higher financing costs for our new developments, which favor the larger institutional players. In our case, however, we have plenty of capital to fund growth on our own. 
Lastly, since spreads between the 10-year yield and GAAP rates are wider than normal, we don't believe modestly higher rates will affect cap rates materially in the long term. Still, we know rate hikes will hit REIT stocks in the short-term as a knee-jerk reaction. We see several years of strong earnings growth ahead. With our work on the balance sheet complete and our stronger than ever liquidity, we're now entirely focused on delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. 
Our leasing portfolio is 12% under rented. This will drive rental growth for several years even under a scenario of flattening market rents going forward. Also supporting our growth story, we own land in key strategic locations. So look for us to continue developing in the world's busiest consumption markets. In short, our team is doing a great job. We look forward to reporting to you in more detail at our investor forum on November 9 in New York. Tom?"

For the third quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by outperformance in our real estate operations and $0.14 of net promotes from 2 of our European ventures. Global occupancy was 96.6% at quarter end, up 60 basis points",739,"Thanks, Hamid. For the third quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by outperformance in our real estate operations and $0.14 of net promotes from 2 of our European ventures. Global occupancy was 96.6% at quarter end, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Europe's occupancy was 96.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over the same time period. Quarterly leasing volume remained very good at 46 million square feet, with a record 41 million from our operating portfolio. Year-to-date, we've leased over 141 million square feet, as our best-in-class portfolio is more critical than ever to our customer supply chain needs. 
Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was 15% led by the U.S. at over 23% for the second consecutive quarter. However, we did see a sequential decrease in our share of rent change, driven by a higher mix of leasing in Europe and Asia this quarter. Our share of same-store NOI increased 5.6% with the U.S. leading the way at 6.9%. The pace of net deployment activity continues to be faster than our forecast. Year-to-date through the third quarter, development stabilizations totaled $1.5 billion with an estimated margin of 28%. Development starts totaled $1.1 billion with an estimated margin of over 18% and value creation of almost $200 million. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.7 billion at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.1%. 
Turning to capital markets. On a look-through basis, our leverage at quarter end was 28.8% on market capitalization and 37% on a book basis. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, was 5.6x and our liquidity was over $3.8 billion. We completed an opportunistic refinancing of 3 yen loans during the quarter, totaling $1.2 billion. The term for the new financing is just under 7 years with a current interest rate of 65 basis points. 
At quarter end, our share of debt had 5.2 years of average remaining term and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. Following a paydown over a multicurrency term loan post quarter end, 86% of our debt is fixed with nearly all of our floating rate debt being yen-denominated. Moving to 2016 guidance. I'll cover just the material changes on a Prologis share basis. So for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. 
Due to continued strong operating fundamentals, we're increasing same-store NOI growth to between 5.5% and 5.8%, up 65 basis points from our prior guidance. Development stabilizations have come in ahead of forecast given our strong leasing activity, and, as a result, we're increasing the range to between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. We're increasing the low end and midpoint disposition and contribution volume, which we now expect to range between $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion. 
We're also raising development starts to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion with build-to-suits representing over 45% of this volume. And we're also increasing our development gains range to between $275 million and $300 million. The net results of our deployment changes is that we expect to generate $100 million more net proceeds than previously expected, resulting in a cash surplus of $1.4 billion. As a reminder, this includes over $800 million of cash from fund ownership rebalancings and the Facebook note proceeds, all of which have already been completed. 
We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion, market leverage at about 27%, book leverage below 35% and debt-to-EBITDA with gains of about 5x. Related to FX. Our 2016 and 2017 estimated core FFO continues to be fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged about half of 2018. Net promotes for the full year are forecasted at $0.15, with the remaining $0.01 coming in the fourth quarter. Putting this altogether, we expect 2016 core FFO, including promotes, to range between $2.56 and $2.57 a share. The increase of $0.015 from our prior guidance midpoint is due to stronger operations, offset by additional dilution from higher liquidity. 
To wrap up. We're delivering 15% core FFO growth this year, in line with our 3-year CAGR of 16%, while at the same time improving our portfolio, building liquidity and further strengthening our balance sheet. Our portfolio quality and financial strength have never been better. This puts us in a great position to continue to realize strong operating results driven by the gap between in-place and market rents and to fund our growth. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

In terms of 2017, I think you'll get a pretty good view of what we think at the investor forum. But at a very general level, I am feeling better about our business than I did a year ago because demand exceeds certainly in the U.S. what we expected a year ago. If I were really looking for a potential negative, I would say that we are further along in capturing the spreads between in-place rents and market rents from the low levels of post-financial crisis. But I fully expect our same-store numbers to be very much in line with what we are seeing this year. We have less opportunity, obviously, on the occupancy side. But I think the rent side of the equation will be the same or maybe a little bit better. So I generally feel very good about the business. In terms of the sector issue, let me give you sort of an essay answer. This is more complicated in our sector than you would think because there are really 3 different things going on when you talk about customers. One is you're talking about what industry sector they're in. Let's take BMW as an example. You could have a manufacturing facility leased to BMW. You can have a parts facility or you could have sort of a wholesale operation, which is distribution of cars. Those all would show up as automotive, but there are definitely different functions. If you take that concept to a retailer, it gets even more complicated because they can be bricks and mortar retail or they can be e-commerce retail, but they're a retailer. So really, the 3 things we track, without over complicating this, is the industry sector of the tenant, in the case of BMW automotive; the actual use of the space, whether it's manufacturing or distribution or whatever; and then the modality. Is it a 3PL? Is it a direct user facility, et cetera, et cetera. So as you can see, this is a complicated thing. And because of the 3PLs, we don't always have visibility through what the underlying businesses that they do, because sometimes it changes. So when we quote you for example statistics on e-commerce, that's really understating the contribution of e-commerce because we don't really know how much of that UPS building is e-commerce. And we classify UPS as an integrated logistic company. So again, it's complicated. But I will tell you, looking through all of that, the things that stand out is that housing is really picking up by a couple of 100,000 units, and that's adding incremental demand, which is really what took occupancies from 96% to 97% in the U.S. I mean that -- if I were going to call out one thing in addition to e-commerce, it would be that. Automotive is also very strong but not as strong as the change on the margin of residential. Anyway, that's how we see it."

What happened during the last 5 or 6 years is that the vacancy rates in smaller size increments have really tightened up. So you see more deliveries in sort of medium- to small-size ranges. And frankly, we're doing the same. So are you going to see an odd deal that is misplaced? You probably will. But I think by and large, most of these projects are well suited. And overall, of course, there's still tremendous excess demand in the system."

And we moved demand up to 250 million, as you heard in my comments. And supply, we think, is going to come in actually at 185 million, lower than we thought.

That capital has a very high multiple force. So I think what they've said publicly is that they are doing the investments in logistics and airplanes and all that kind of stuff, by the way which they're all leasing, to supplement the volume that they get out of UPS and FedEx. And particularly, over a very busy holiday season because a couple of years ago, you remember that there were some complications with some of the deliveries that they felt hurt their brand.

So look, land varies all over the place and the reasons for it is that rents vary all over the place. And essentially, the way to think about it, and you know this as a real estate developer, the building costs are not that different between different regions. They're a little different because of the unions and all that, but maybe they vary 20% in the U.S. But rents vary by a lot more than that. And all of the difference falls to the residual, which is the land. So if rents are higher and building costs are -- rents are higher by 10%, 20% and building costs are the same, land could be 50%, 70% higher from one location compared to the other. And then when you get into Bay Area and some of the anomalies, obviously the differences get really magnified. Secondly, as you pointed out, there's a big difference between land that is improved versus land that is still in raw condition. We have very little on unentitled land, I mean, like tiny, tiny on unentitled land. So all of it is entitled, but not all of it is actually improved because it would imprudent to put in the improvement too far ahead on larger parks. So I think at the end of the day, what you need to look at -- and we're not providing that because that's a pro forma number that gets into a lot of assumptions. You want to really look at finished land per FAR. And that's really the true measure that we look at. And I think that's really correlated with rents less development costs.

And if you -- I think you've heard me talk about this before. If you really think about the market being sort of in the long-term, 1.5% to 2% inflation and bonds are 200% -- 200 basis point premium, that sort of argues for a 3.5% to 4% treasury in the long term, which is quite a ways from where we are here. And that, consistent with 5.5-ish type cap rates in our sector, makes sense in a historical context and probably 6.5%, 7% IRRs. I mean that's an appropriate spread over a 10-year treasury. So I think nobody's paying for real estate as if 10-year treasuries are going to be 1.8% or whatever they are today into the future. And I think the way to think about it is that investors in the short-term are getting a windfall because they're really pricing against much higher treasuries and collecting the bonus in the short term. I don't know why there's so much focus on the Feds fund rate. I think the world has become such a big macro things and there are like 28 zillion people watching the same screen, and what some Fed governor says at lunch one day. I mean I just don't know. I don't borrow. We don't borrow at the Feds fund rate, so whether it goes up or down 25 basis points, I don't really know. All I can tell you is that the last time they increased the Fed funds rate, the 10-year treasury went down. So what we care about actually got cheaper. But I'm not a market psychologist, so I'll leave that to others to explain the knee-jerk reaction. But that's what happens. REITs fell off and then 6 months later, because of the stronger economy, which is the underlying cause of rates going up, it starts showing up in rents and they recover. And that's what historical facts have said. In terms of fund demand. I would tell you that we have infinite fund demand in Europe. And in the U.S., fund demand is good. But I would say it's a little bit less than it was a year ago or 2 years ago. But it's still pretty solid.

I know some companies, when they report occupancies, they report overall occupancy, including their underdevelopment stuff that is not fully leased or stabilized. We don't do that. When we operate, we have a definition of stabilization. And the stabilization is the earlier achievement of 90% occupancy for a development project or a year from certificate of occupancy, right? So whether it leases or not, it goes into the operating pool after a year, and it goes into the operating pool sooner than that when it hits 90%. So the occupancies we report are the occupancies for the operating portfolio, and separately we report the occupancy for the development portfolio. So our same-store numbers are not boosted artificially by simply the lease up of the development business. I know some other companies do it a different way. I'm not going to pass judgment on that.

And really, how customers think and behave. So that's the second thing. And the third thing is that we get a lot of questions on why global and why development and why all this kind of stuff. And they're all related. And we want people to walk away with a better appreciation of the different components of our business and how they all fit together and how they energize one another. So if we can get those 3 key concepts across, I think we would call it a successful meeting."

Typical years would have us doing 35% or more in the fourth quarter. This year, it's called about 40%. 100% of that activity is completely identified. In fact, we've had a handful of starts already underway in October. And all of this work is taking place within our existing parks on sites that we own, so we can really control the timing of those starts. So we're highly confident in our ability to fulfill the rest of this activity yet in this quarter. And in terms of build-to-suit mix, it's approaching 50%. It's hovered in the high 30s and 40s over the last 3 or 4 years. We've been very active in the build-to-suit business. Had a record number of build-to-suits in the last 12 months. And so our build-to-suit percentage is growing also while development volume is growing. And that's a fairly big statement."

And let me also take this opportunity to point out a difference in how we calculate retention and same-store and all that. We don't make judgments about whether the tenant could've, would've, should've, did stay or go or whatever. We report actual retention. So if the tenant actually leaves the portfolio and goes into a bigger building, it's not retained in our -- the way that we calculate it. I don't think our -- as a result, I don't think our numbers are directly comparable with how other people may report it because they apply judgment to it, and they filter a bunch of things out.
