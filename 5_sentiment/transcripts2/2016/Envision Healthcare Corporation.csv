387568,325375180,939875,"AmSurg Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Envision Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Claire.

We have a lot to cover today, so I'm just going to jump right into the overview. As everyone can see, 2015 was a year of great transformation, execution and positive momentum for AmSurg and Sheridan Healthcare. Let me review a few of the highlights for the full fiscal year. Our net revenue increased 58%, and our EPS increased 35%. Adjusted EBITDA was $492 million. We generated cash flows of $323 million. Our same-store growth was 11.5% in Physician Services and 6% for Ambulatory Surgery Services. As you're all well aware, we raised about $440 million in new equity in Q4 of 2015 and reduced our leverage from 5.3x to 4.1x. 
I'm pleased to say that we were -- in light of all this growth, we have maintained and stayed true to our physician-centric culture that resulted in a very powerful year of M&A growth and expansion, yielding 16 transactions. We were able to deploy nearly $1 billion in growth capital, and since the acquisition of Sheridan, have invested in every vertical in our portfolio. We also successfully executed, through the first full year of combination and integration with Sheridan Healthcare. Amongst the many highlights there, we expanded our health system partnerships. We now have 18 different health systems partnered in 29 of our ASC across our platform. And also now, we have Sheridan anesthesia covering nearly 25% of our multispecialty ASCs. 
With that, I'm going to move to the technical highlights for the quarter. Our adjusted EPS
was $1.07, ahead of guidance for the quarter. Revenues were up 21% versus prior year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, up 24% versus prior year, same period. We did complete 2 ASC acquisitions and acquired 2 -- including 2 additional multispecialty ASCs that were acquired subsequent to quarter end. We've entered into 3 health system joint ventures, which involved the contribution of 6 ASCs and the addition of 2 new surgery centers contributed by our hospital partners. Physician Services division acquired 3 practices during the quarter, 2 anesthesia and 1 emergency services. Our new relationship with Northside Anesthesia Consultants in Atlanta marks our first entry into the state of Georgia. We also added Premier Emergency Medical Specialists to our increasingly significant presence in the Phoenix market. 
Overall, the M&A pipeline remains very robust, and we will continue to pursue strategic opportunities on all fronts. And I'll ask Claire in just a moment to provide additional color on the quarter and the full overview of 2016 guidance in her comments. Specifically, for the quarter in the ASC division, net revenues increased by 10%, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 22% and margins increased 180 basis points. Same-center revenue for the ASC division was 6.9 and contributed about 48% of our total revenues for the quarter. And we ended the quarter with 257 centers and 1 surgical hospital. Included in that portfolio are 151 GI centers, 39 ophthalmology centers and 67 orthopedic and multi specialty centers. We also ended the quarter with 5 centers under LOI and 1 center under development. For the Physician Services Division in the quarter, our net revenue increased 32% and adjusted EBITDA increased 25%. Contract revenue growth was 9.6% for the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, Physician Services contributed 52% of AmSurg's total revenue. Within that, the Anesthesia Service contributed 37% of the total consolidated AmSurg revenue. And again, here, we have very active pipelines and remain very active in all Physician Services verticals. 
As you can see, it was a tremendous year, 2015, solid fourth quarter and I'm pleased that we're also off to a solid start in 2016 in all -- in both Physician Services and the Ambulatory Surgery division, and are pleased with our continued momentum. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Claire to discuss results for Q4 and guidance for 2016."

For the fourth quarter, our revenues increased 21% to $704 million. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $1.07. This positive variance was again driven by our strong organic growth in both Ambulatory and Physician Services and by acquisitions. It also includes an approximately $0.02 negative impact from dilution related to our December equity offering. During the quarter, we recorded a $31 million noncash net gain comprised of a $32 million gain on the deconsolidation of 6 surgery centers netted against a $1 million loss on the deconsolidation of a physician services contract that was contributed to our HCA joint venture. We also recorded a $500,000 charge for a change in contingent purchase price valuation for a prior year Physician Services acquisition. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $137 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.5%. Acquisition and development capital expenditures totaled $730 million for the quarter and maintenance Capex was $13 million. For the full year, total acquisition and development CapEx was $963 million. Our net operating cash flow led distributions to noncontrolling interest with $54 million for the quarter and $323 million for the full year. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 35.5%, lower than we've experienced in the prior 3 quarters. Due to tax planning efforts, we were able to release a previously established state tax valuation allowance, and we expect our tax rate to return to 40% in 2016. For purposes of recording fourth quarter adjusted EPS, we have used a 40% tax rate. 
Our cash balance at quarter-end was $106.7 million, total debt was $2.4 billion and our pro forma debt to leverage was 4.1x. In the ambulatory services operations, ASC revenue increased 10% to $326 million and same-center revenues increased 6.9% during the quarter. Same-center volume growth was 2.2% and revenue per procedure increased 4.7%. This revenue per procedure increase was driven by Medicare and managed care reimbursement improvement of approximately 3.4% and 1.3% by the addition of anesthesia services in 6 of our GI centers over the prior year. Adjusted net EBITDA was $63.3 million, a 22% increase over the prior year and our EBITDA margin was 19.4%. In the Physician Services operation, net revenue for the quarter was $378 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter. Acquisitions contributed 24.3%, same contract revenue contributed 6.2% and new contracts contributed 1.7%. Direct practice expenses were $279 million.  Adjusted EBITDA was $74.1 million, an increase of 25% over Sheridan's prior-year quarter and the EBITDA margin was 19.6%. Same contract revenue was 8.3% for the quarter. Patient encounters were up 6.6% and net revenue per encounter was up 1.7%. This strong volume growth was again positively impacted by volume from the exchanges and by improving employment rates. In addition, we are seeing a positive impact from the expansion in the number of operating rooms in some of our larger hospital clients.  Revenue per encounter growth was smaller than prior quarters and as we saw new exchange players enter the market which increased our volumes, they came in at rates lower than some of our existing exchange payers. In addition, we saw some increased volumes at contracts with subsidies, which positively impacted volume but reduced our subsidy revenue. 
Today, we are providing full year 2016 guidance and establishing first quarter guidance as follows: Revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion; same center revenue increase of 3% to 5% in Ambulatory Services and same contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services. New contract growth is expected to be in the range of 1% to 2%. Adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $600 million; adjusted EPS in the range of $4.26 to $4.35 -- $4.34; and adjusted EPS in the first quarter in the range of $0.77 to $0.80. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 to be 57.4 million. 
At this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

You also mentioned something about some contracts without subsidy, and I just want to understand that a little bit better. I guess, just conceptually, we thought in contracts with subsidy, that got physicians to market rates and contracts about subsidies, the payer mix was supporting revenue at market rates. So can you elaborate on that a little bit?"

We look at that as a really hurdle pipeline for M&A in the remaining centers that we have in the pipeline, and also for new acquisitions to bring the anesthesia along at the time of acquisitions in the surgery centers. The truth is that we probably couldn't move that quickly because the anesthesia groups that are currently supporting many of our centers are very large and nice regional groups. So our focus has been to build relationships with them, try to introduce them to the Sheridan opportunity and see at some point if they would join forces with us, either through acquisition or coming onboard.

387568,325375180,940091,"AmSurg Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Envision Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Claire. We have a lot to cover today, so I'm just going to jump right into the overview. As everyone can see, 2015 was a year of great transformation, execution and positive momentum for AmSurg and Sheridan Healthcare. Let me review a few of the h",640,"Thanks, Claire. We have a lot to cover today, so I'm just going to jump right into the overview. As everyone can see, 2015 was a year of great transformation, execution and positive momentum for AmSurg and Sheridan Healthcare. Let me review a few of the highlights for the full fiscal year. Our net revenue increased 58%, and our EPS increased 35%. Adjusted EBITDA was $492 million. We generated cash flows of $323 million. Our same-store growth was 11.5% in Physician Services and 6% for Ambulatory Surgery Services. As you're all well aware, we raised about $440 million in new equity in Q4 of 2015 and reduced our leverage from 5.3x to 4.1x.
I'm pleased to say that we were -- in light of all this growth, we have maintained and stayed true to our physician-centric culture that resulted in a very powerful year of M&A growth and expansion, yielding 16 transactions. We were able to deploy nearly $1 billion in growth capital, and since the acquisition of Sheridan, have invested in every vertical in our portfolio. We also successfully executed, through the first full year of combination and integration with Sheridan Healthcare. Amongst the many highlights there, we expanded our health system partnerships. We now have 18 different health systems partnered in 29 of our ASC across our platform. And also now, we have Sheridan anesthesia covering nearly 25% of our multispecialty ASCs.
With that, I'm going to move to the technical highlights for the quarter. Our adjusted EPS
was $1.07, ahead of guidance for the quarter. Revenues were up 21% versus prior year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, up 24% versus prior year same period. We did complete 2 ASC acquisitions and acquired 2 -- including 2 additional multispecialty ASCs that were acquired subsequent to quarter end. We've entered into 3 health system joint ventures, which involved the contribution of 6 ASCs and the addition of 2 new surgery centers contributed by our hospital partners. Physician Services Division acquired 3 practices during the quarter, 2 anesthesia and 1 emergency services. Our new relationship with Northside Anesthesia Consultants in Atlanta marks our first entry into the state of Georgia. We also added Premier Emergency Medical Specialists to our increasingly significant presence in the Phoenix market.
Overall, the M&A pipeline remains very robust, and we will continue to pursue strategic opportunities on all fronts. And I'll ask Claire in just a moment to provide additional color on the quarter and the full overview of 2016 guidance in her comments.
Specifically for the quarter in the ASC division, net revenues increased by 10%, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 22% and margins increased 180 basis points. Same-center revenue for the ASC division was 6.9%. It contributed about 48% of our total revenues for the quarter. And we ended the quarter with 257 centers and 1 surgical hospital. Included in that portfolio are 151 GI centers, 39 ophthalmology centers and 67 orthopedic and multispecialty centers. We also ended the quarter with 5 centers under LOI and 1 center under development.
For the Physician Services Division in the quarter, our net revenue increased 32% and adjusted EBITDA increased 25%, and contract revenue growth was 9.6% for the quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, Physician Services contributed 52% of AmSurg's total revenue. Within that, the anesthesia service contributed 37% of the total consolidated AmSurg revenue. And again, here, we have very active pipelines and remain very active in all Physician Services verticals.
As you can see, it was a tremendous year, 2015, solid fourth quarter. And I'm pleased to also add, we're off to a solid start in 2016 in all -- in both Physician Services and the Ambulatory Surgery Division and are pleased with our continued momentum.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Claire to discuss results for Q4 and guidance for 2016."

For the fourth quarter, our revenues increased 21% to $704 million. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $1.07.

For the fourth quarter, our revenues increased 21% to $704 million. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $1.07. This positive variance was again driven by our strong organic growth in both Ambulatory and Physician Services and by acquisitions. It also includes an approximately $0.02 negative impact from dilution related to our December equity offering.
During the quarter, we recorded a $31 million noncash net gain comprised of a $32 million gain on the deconsolidation of 6 surgery centers netted against a $1 million loss on the deconsolidation of a physician services contract that was contributed to our HCA joint venture. We also recorded a $500,000 charge for a change in contingent purchase price valuation for a prior period -- prior year Physician Services acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA was $137 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.5%. Acquisition and development capital expenditures totaled $730 million for the quarter, and maintenance Capex was $13 million. For the full year, total acquisition and development CapEx was $963 million.
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interests was $54 million for the quarter and $323 million for the full year. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 35.5% lower than we've experienced in the prior 3 quarters. Due to tax planning efforts, we were able to release a previously established state tax valuation allowance, and we expect our tax rate to return to 40% in 2016. For purposes of recording fourth quarter adjusted EPS, we have used a 40% tax rate. Our cash balance at quarter-end was $106.7 million, total debt was $2.4 billion and our pro forma debt to EBITDA leverage was 4.1x.
In the Ambulatory Services operations, ASC revenue increased 10% to $326 million and same-center revenues increased 6.9% during the quarter. Same-center volume growth was 2.2% and revenue per procedure increased 4.7%. This revenue per procedure increase was driven by Medicare and managed care reimbursement improvement of approximately 3.4% and 1.3% by the addition of anesthesia services in 6 of our GI centers over the prior year. Adjusted net EBITDA was $63.3 million, a 22% increase over the prior year, and our EBITDA margin was 19.4%.
In the Physician Services operation, net revenue for the quarter was $378 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter. Acquisitions contributed 24.3%, same contract revenue contributed 6.2% and new contracts contributed 1.7%. Direct practice expenses were $279 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $74.1 million, an increase of 25% over Sheridan's prior year quarter, and the EBITDA margin was 19.6%. Same contract revenue was 8.3% for the quarter. Patient encounters were up 6.6% and net revenue per encounter was up 1.7%. This strong volume growth was again positively impacted by volume from the exchanges and by improving employment rates. In addition, we are seeing a positive impact from the expansion in the number of operating rooms at some of our larger hospital clients.
Revenue per encounter growth was smaller than prior quarters as we saw new exchange payers enter the market, which increased our volumes, but came in at rates lower than some of our existing exchange payers. In addition, we saw some increased volumes at contracts with subsidies, which positively impacted volume but reduced our subsidy revenue.
Today, we are providing full year 2016 guidance and establishing first quarter guidance as follows: Revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion; same-center revenue increase of 3% to 5% for Ambulatory Services and same contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services. New contract growth is expected to be in the range of 1% to 2%. Adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $600 million; adjusted EPS in the range of $4.26 to $4.35 -- $4.34; and adjusted EPS for the first quarter in the range of $0.77 to $0.80. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 to be 57.4 million.
At this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

The truth is that we probably couldn't move that quickly because the anesthesia groups that are currently supporting many of our centers are very large and nice regional groups. So our focus has been to build relationships with them, try to introduce them to the Sheridan opportunity and see at some point if they would join forces with us, either through acquisition or coming onboard.

387568,325375180,940128,"AmSurg Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Envision Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Claire. We have a lot to cover today, so I'm just going to jump right into the overview. As everyone can see, 2015 was a year of great transformation, execution and positive momentum for AmSurg and Sheridan Healthcare. Let me review a few of the h",643,"Thanks, Claire. We have a lot to cover today, so I'm just going to jump right into the overview. As everyone can see, 2015 was a year of great transformation, execution and positive momentum for AmSurg and Sheridan Healthcare. Let me review a few of the highlights for the full fiscal year. Our net revenue increased 58%, and our EPS increased 35%. Adjusted EBITDA was $492 million. We generated cash flows of $323 million. Our same-store growth was 11.5% in Physician Services and 6% for ambulatory surgery services. As you're all well aware, we raised about $440 million in new equity in Q4 of 2015 and reduced our leverage from 5.3x to 4.1x.
I'm pleased to say that we were -- in light of all this growth, we have maintained and stayed true to our physician-centric culture that resulted in a very powerful year of M&A growth and expansion, yielding 16 transactions. We were able to deploy nearly $1 billion in growth capital, and since the acquisition of Sheridan, have invested in every vertical in our portfolio. We also successfully executed through the first full year of combination and integration with Sheridan Healthcare. Amongst the many highlights there, we expanded our health system partnerships. We now have 18 different health systems partnered in 29 of our ASCs across our platform. And also now, we have Sheridan anesthesia covering nearly 25% of our multispecialty ASCs.
With that, I'm going to move to the technical highlights for the quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.07, ahead of guidance for the quarter. Revenues were up 21% versus prior year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, up 24% versus prior year same period. We did complete 2 ASC acquisitions and acquired 2 -- including 2 additional multispecialty ASCs that were acquired subsequent to quarter-end. We've entered into 3 health system joint ventures, which involved the contribution of 6 ASCs and the addition of 2 new surgery centers contributed by our hospital partners. Physician Services Division acquired 3 practices during the quarter: 2 anesthesia and 1 emergency services. Our new relationship with Northside Anesthesia Consultants (sic) [Northside Anesthesiology Consultants] in Atlanta marks our first entry into the state of Georgia. We also added Premier Emergency Medical Specialists to our increasingly significant presence in the Phoenix market.
Overall, the M&A pipeline remains very robust, and we will continue to pursue strategic opportunities on all fronts. And I'll ask Claire in just a moment to provide additional color on the quarter and the full overview of 2016 guidance in her comments.
Specifically for the quarter in the ASC division, net revenues increased by 10%, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 22% and margins increased 180 basis points. Same-center revenue for the ASC division was 6.9%. It contributed about 48% of our total revenues for the quarter. And we ended the quarter with 257 centers and 1 surgical hospital. Included in that portfolio are 151 GI centers, 39 ophthalmology centers and 67 orthopedic and multispecialty centers. We also ended the quarter with 5 centers under LOI and 1 center under development.
For the Physician Services Division in the quarter, our net revenue increased 32% and adjusted EBITDA increased 25%, and contract revenue growth was 9.6% for the quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, Physician Services contributed 52% of AmSurg's total revenue. Within that, the anesthesia service contributed 37% of the total consolidated AmSurg revenue. And again, here, we have very active pipelines and remain very active in all Physician Services verticals.
As you can see, it was a tremendous year, 2015, solid fourth quarter. And I'm pleased to also add, we're off to a solid start in 2016 in all -- in both Physician Services and the ambulatory surgery division and are pleased with our continued momentum.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Claire to discuss results for Q4 and guidance for 2016."

For the fourth quarter, our revenues increased 21% to $704 million. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 39% to $1.07. This positive variance was again driven by our strong organic growth in both Ambulatory and Physician Services and by acquisitions. It also includes an approximately $0.02 negative impact from dilution related to our December equity offering.
During the quarter, we recorded a $31 million noncash net gain, comprised of a $32 million gain on the deconsolidation of 6 surgery centers netted against a $1 million loss on the deconsolidation of a physician services contract that was contributed to our HCA joint venture. We also recorded a $500,000 charge for a change in contingent purchase price valuation for a prior period -- prior year Physician Services acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA was $137 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.5%. Acquisition and development capital expenditures totaled $730 million for the quarter, and maintenance CapEx was $13 million. For the full year, total acquisition and development CapEx was $963 million.
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interests was $54 million for the quarter and $323 million for the full year. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations, less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, was 35.5%, lower than we've experienced in the prior 3 quarters. Due to tax planning efforts, we were able to release a previously established state tax valuation allowance, and we expect our tax rate to return to 40% in 2016. For purposes of reporting fourth quarter adjusted EPS, we have used a 40% tax rate. Our cash balance at quarter-end was $106.7 million, total debt was $2.4 billion and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.1x.
In the Ambulatory Services operations, ASC revenue increased 10% to $326 million and same-center revenues increased 6.9% during the quarter. Same-center volume growth was 2.2% and revenue per procedure increased 4.7%. This revenue-per-procedure increase was driven by Medicare and managed care reimbursement improvement of approximately 3.4% and 1.3% by the addition of anesthesia services in 6 of our GI centers over the prior year. Adjusted net EBITDA was $63.3 million, a 22% increase over the prior year, and our EBITDA margin was 19.4%.
In the Physician Services operation, net revenue for the quarter was $378 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions contributed 24.3%, same-contract revenue contributed 6.2% and new contracts contributed 1.7%. Direct practice expenses were $279 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $74.1 million, an increase of 25% over Sheridan's prior-year quarter, and the EBITDA margin was 19.6%. Same-contract revenue was 8.3% for the quarter. Patient encounters were up 6.6% and net revenue per encounter was up 1.7%. This strong volume growth was again positively impacted by volume from the exchanges and by improving employment rates. In addition, we are seeing a positive impact from the expansion in the number of operating rooms at some of our larger hospital clients.
Revenue-per-encounter growth was smaller than prior quarters as we saw new exchange payers enter the market, which increased our volumes, but came in at rates lower than some of our existing exchange payers. In addition, we saw some increased volumes at contracts with subsidies, which positively impacted volume but reduced our subsidy revenue.
Today, we are providing full year 2016 guidance and establishing first quarter guidance as follows: Revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion, same-center revenue increase of 3% to 5% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services. New contract growth is expected to be in the range of 1% to 2%. Adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $600 million; adjusted EPS in the range of $4.26 to $4.35 -- $4.34; and adjusted EPS for the first quarter in the range of $0.77 to $0.80. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 to be 57.4 million.
At this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

You also mentioned something about some contracts without subsidy, and just wanted to understand that a little bit better.

So can you elaborate on that a little bit?"

We look at that as a really fertile pipeline for M&A, in the remaining centers that we have in the pipeline, and also for new acquisitions, to bring the anesthesia along at the time of acquisition in the surgery centers. The truth is that we probably couldn't move that quickly because the anesthesia groups that are currently supporting many of our centers are very large and nice regional groups. So our focus has been to build relationships with them, try to introduce them to the Sheridan opportunity and see at some point if they would join forces with us, either through acquisition or coming onboard.

I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum from 2015 is carried over into the first quarter of 2016, which is driving 27% growth in our net revenues, now totaling $725 million, with same -- strong same-center and same-contract rev",534,"Thank you, Claire. I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum from 2015 is carried over into the first quarter of 2016, which is driving 27% growth in our net revenues, now totaling $725 million, with same -- strong same-center and same-contract revenue growth for the Ambulatory Surgery and Physician Services divisions. We are modifying our guidance to reflect that strength in Q1, and Claire will have more on that shortly. 
Let's now move to the performance highlights for the quarter. Overall, our adjusted EPS increased by 32% at $0.82 a share and $0.02 above the top end of our previous guidance. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $120 million, up 28% over the prior-year prior quarter. For that same period, adjusted net earnings increased 47% to $47 million. And we completed 2 additional Physician Services transaction and 1 additional ASC transaction this year. One of those in the first quarter. Our focus since the fourth quarter of last year and into the first quarter of this year has really been in large part on the integration of the large acquisitions that we completed late last year, but I'm pleased to report that the pipelines remain very solid in both service lines, and we believe our projections for growth are very achievable. Claire is going to provide additional color on the quarter and the full overview of our guidance in her comments. 
Now speaking directly on specifically to the Ambulatory Services division, again, on a prior year prior quarter basis, our same-center revenue growth for the division was 8.8%; our net revenues increased 8% to $307 million, and keeping in mind that this now includes the impact of non-centers that were deconsolidated in 2015. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $54 million. Our margins increased 80 basis points. The ASC division contributed 42% of our total revenue in the quarter, which is down from the 50% in the same quarter of '15, representing a significant shift in our mix of business towards Physician Services. We still are strongly very bullish on the ASC division. We just had a really strong year in development last year, which has now tipped the scale in the favor of Physician Services. The division also ended the quarter with 256 centers and 1 surgical hospital. The count there are 151 GI centers, 38 ophthalmology centers and 67 multispecialty centers. We ended the quarter with 6 centers under LOI and 1 center in development. 
For Physician Services, net revenues increased 46% to $418 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 43% to $66.5 million. Our same-contract revenue growth for the division was 12%, and the division contributed 58% of the company's total revenue. And within that, our anesthesia service contributed 42% of the total consolidated AmSurg revenue. There's a very active pipeline in the Physician Services verticals, and during the quarter, as I mentioned, we added 1 group to our children services network in the Phoenix, Arizona market, and subsequent to the quarter, we added a significant anesthesia group in Northeast Florida. 
We are off to a solid start again in Q2, and now with that, I'll turn the call over to Claire to discuss the results for Q1 and to present revised guidance for 2016."

As Chris stated, we are pleased to report a strong start to 2016. Our revenues increased 27% to $725 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $0.82, driven by our strong organic growth in both Ambulatory and Physician Services and by acquisitions completed primarily in the fourth quarter of '15. The growth in our adjusted earnings per share is inclusive of the 12% increase in our diluted shares outstanding due to our December 2015 equity offering. 
Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to $6.579 million [ph] for the quarter compared to $2.651 million [ph] in the prior year due to the deconsolidation of non-additional ASPs in '15. Adjusted EBITDA grew 28% to $120 million for the quarter and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.6%. As anticipated, our adjusted EBITDA margin is negatively impacted in the first quarter each year due to higher salary-related costs primarily in the Physician Services Division. 
Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $3 million for the quarter and maintenance CapEx was $13 million. Our net operating cash flow led distributions to noncontrolling interest of $26 million for the quarter, below our first quarter '15 operating cash flow of $52 million due to several items. We had incentive comp payouts for this year of approximately $16 million more than the prior year. We had higher tax payments of $9 million more than last year as we were in a tax receivable position in the first quarter of '15. In addition, we had an increase in our accounts receivable of $15 million during the quarter. This increase was driven by 2 factors: First, temporary to light billing from cash collections at recent acquisitions as we go through the change of ownership process. And secondly, by delayed collections from our implementation of ITD 10 which caused a backlog in billings in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations, earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest is 40%. Our cash balance at quarter end was $86 million, and our total debt was $2.4 billion, and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage remained at 4.1x at quarter-end. 
In our Ambulatory Services operations, ASC revenue increased 8% to $307 million and same-center revenues increased 8.8% during the quarter. Procedures per day increased 5%. The extra day in the quarter contributed 1.7%, and we had a 2.1% increase in net revenue per procedure. The revenue per procedure growth is due primarily to the remaining tail on Anesthesia Services initiated at 6 of our GI centers in 2015, as well as normal rate increases. We will begin to anniversary the impact of these new Anesthesia Services in the second quarter. 
Adjusted net EBITDA was $54 million, a 13% increase over the prior year and our EBITDA margin was 17.5%. Revenue was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 5.5% of the revenue in the first quarter of '15. In Physician Services operations, net revenues for the quarter was $418 million, an increase of 46% over the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions contributed 34.4% and contract revenue contributed 10.1% and net new contracts contributed 1.2%. Direct practice expenses were $320 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $66.5 million, an increase of 43% over the prior-year quarter and the EBITDA margin was 15.9%. Same-contract revenue growth was 12% for the quarter. Patient encounters per day were up 7.3%. The extra day contributed 1.7% and net revenue-per-encounter increased 3%. This strong volume growth was again positively impacted by volume from the exchanges, improving employment rates and the expansion in the number of ORs at some of our larger hospital clients. A large portion of this revenue-per-encounter increase resulted from a delay in the recognition of exchange revenue between Q1 and Q2 of 2015. 
Today, we are reiterating and adjusting certain metrics of our full year 2016 guidance range and establishing second quarter guidance as follows: Annual revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion unchanged; [indiscernible] to the revenue increase of 4% to 6% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services; new contract growth continues to be expected in the range of 1% to 2%; adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $601 million; adjusted EPS in the range of $4.28 to $4.35; and adjusted EPS for the second quarter in the range of $1.06 to $1.09. 
And at this time, operator, I'll open it up to questions."

Obviously, the rate increases for the ASC division, which were 2.1% this quarter, will -- approximately half of that will begin to anniversary in the second quarter of this year as we started those programs in the second quarter of last year. On the Physician Services side, I think it's really hard on the volume number to really parse out anything else other than the extra day. But on the rate side, I think probably half of the rate increase was driven by some of the adjustments that we made to revenue recognition last year between Q1 and Q2."

Fortunately, I think the company, strategically, has always operated mostly in in-network fashion. So today, that is still predominantly, the manner in which we're operating within Physician Services. From time to time, in a certain market, we may be out-of-network with a payer, but that is typically just a part of a negotiation or a renegotiation process of our contract. So we haven't yet seen any fundamental change in the payer environment and have been successful within the division renewing some significant contracts in the last 3 to 4 months there over multi-years and continue to be on favorable terms. So certainly the legislative environment is changing to give consumers a better position in dealing with out-of-network situations. But for us, I think we've been fortunate that we've been effective in negotiating good rates to be in an out-of-network basis."

One is the materiality of the acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter. Those acquisitions are still being integrated, which includes realizing the synergies within those acquisitions both on rates and a few costs in the context of the overhead embedded in those practices. So that's a driver. And there has been a couple of markets, particularly the California market, where we have invested in recruiting additional physicians to handle the growth because we have significant growth opportunities, a little bit behind the 8 ball and having the physician staff to meet those growth opportunities. So did a pretty aggressive push during the first quarter to bring on more physician resources in the California market. Probably those are probably my 2 biggest drivers.

I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum from 2015 is carried over into the first quarter of 2016, and it's driving 27% growth in our net revenues, now totaling $725 million with same -- strong same-center and same-contract reve",532,"Thank you, Claire. I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum from 2015 is carried over into the first quarter of 2016, and it's driving 27% growth in our net revenues, now totaling $725 million with same -- strong same-center and same-contract revenue growth for the Ambulatory Surgery and Physician Services division. We are modifying our guidance to reflect that strength in Q1, and Claire will have more on that shortly.
Let's now move to the performance highlights for the quarter. Overall, our adjusted EPS increased by 32% at $0.82 a share and $0.02 above the top end of our previous guidance. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $120 million, up 28% over prior year prior quarter. For that same period, adjusted net earnings increased 47% to $47 million. And we completed 2 additional Physician Services transaction and 1 additional ASC transaction this year, one of those in the first quarter. Our focus, since the fourth quarter of last year and into the first quarter of this year, has really been in large part on the integration of the large acquisitions that we completed late last year, but I'm pleased to report that the pipelines remain very solid in both service lines, and we believe our projections for growth are very achievable. Claire is going to provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our guidance in her comments.
Now speaking directly on specifically to the Ambulatory Services division, again, on a prior-year prior-quarter basis, our same-center revenue growth for the division was 8.8%; our net revenues increased 8% to $307 million, and keeping in mind that this now includes the impact of noncenters that were deconsolidated in 2015. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $54 million. Our margins increased 80 basis points. The ASC division contributed 42% of our total revenue in the quarter, which is down from the 50% in the same quarter of '15, representing a significant shift in our mix of business towards Physician Services. We still are strongly very bullish on the ASC division. We just had a really strong year in development last year, which has now tipped the scale in the favor of Physician Services. The division also ended the quarter with 256 centers and 1 surgical hospital. The count there are 151 GI centers, 38 ophthalmology centers and 67 multispecialty centers. We ended the quarter with 6 centers under LOI and 1 center in development.
For Physician Services, net revenues increased 46% to $418 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 43% to $66.5 million. Our same-contract revenue growth for the division was 12%, and the division contributed 58% of the company's total revenue. And within that, our anesthesia service contributed 42% of the total consolidated AmSurg revenue. There's a very active pipeline in the Physician Services verticals, and during the quarter, as I mentioned, we added 1 group to our children services network in the Phoenix, Arizona market, and subsequent to the quarter, we added a significant anesthesia group in Northeast Florida.
We are off to a solid start again in Q2, and now with that, I'll turn the call over to Claire to discuss the results for Q1 and to present revised guidance for 2016."

As Chris stated, we are pleased to report a strong start to 2016. Our revenues increased 27% to $725 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $0.82, driven by our strong organic growth in both Ambulatory and Physician Services and by acquisitions completed primarily in the fourth quarter of '15. The growth in our adjusted earnings per share is inclusive of the 12% increase in our diluted shares outstanding due to our December 2015 equity offering.
Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to $6.579 million for the quarter compared to $2.651 million in the prior year due to the deconsolidation of nonadditional ASPs in '15. Adjusted EBITDA grew 28% to $120 million for the quarter and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.6%. As anticipated, our adjusted EBITDA margin is negatively impacted in the first quarter each year due to higher salary-related costs, primarily in the Physician Services Division.
Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $3 million for the quarter and maintenance CapEx was $13 million. Our net operating cash flow led distributions to noncontrolling interest of $26 million for the quarter, below our first quarter '15 operating cash flow of $52 million due to several items. We had incentive comp payouts this year of approximately $16 million more than prior year. We had higher tax payments of $9 million more than last year as we were in a tax receivable position in the first quarter of '15. In addition, we had an increase in our accounts receivable of $15 million during the quarter. This increase was driven by 2 factors: first, temporary to light billing from cash collections at recent acquisitions as we go through the change of ownership process. And secondly, by delayed collections from our implementation of ICD-10, which caused a backlog in billings in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations, earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest is 40%. Our cash balance at quarter-end was $86 million, and our total debt was $2.4 billion, and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage remained at 4.1x at quarter-end.
In our Ambulatory Services operations, ASC revenue increased 8% to $307 million and same-center revenues increased 8.8% during the quarter. Procedures per day increased 5%. The extra day in the quarter contributed 1.7%, and we had a 2.1% increase in net revenue per procedure. The revenue per procedure growth is due primarily to the remaining tail on Anesthesia Services initiated at 6 of our GI centers in 2015 as well as normal rate increases. We will begin to anniversary the impact of these new Anesthesia Services in the second quarter.
Adjusted net EBITDA was $54 million, a 13% increase over the prior year and our EBITDA margin was 17.5%. Revenue was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 5.5% of the revenue in the first quarter of '15. In Physician Services operations, net revenues for the quarter was $418 million, an increase of 46% over the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions contributed 34.4% and contract revenue contributed 10.1% and net new contracts contributed 1.2%. Direct practice expenses were $320 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $66.5 million, an increase of 43% over the prior year quarter and the EBITDA margin was 15.9%. Same-contract revenue growth was 12% for the quarter. Patient encounters per day were up 7.3%. The extra day contributed 1.7% and net revenue-per-encounter increased 3%. This strong volume growth was again positively impacted by volume from the exchanges, improving employment rates and the expansion in the number of ORs at some of our larger hospital clients. A large portion of this revenue-per-encounter increase resulted from a delay in the recognition of exchange revenue between Q1 and Q2 of 2015. 
Today, we are reiterating and adjusting certain metrics of our full year 2016 guidance range and establishing second quarter guidance as follows: annual revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion unchanged; same-center revenue increase of 4% to 6% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services; new contract growth continues to be expected in a range of 1% to 2%; adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $601 million; adjusted EPS in the range of $4.28 to $4.35; and adjusted EPS for the second quarter in the range of $1.06 to $1.09.

On the Physician Services side, I think it's really hard on the volume number to really parse out anything else other than the extra day.

Fortunately, I think the company, strategically, has always operated mostly in in-network fashion, so today, that is still predominantly the manner in which we're operating within Physician Services. From time to time, in a certain market, we may be out-of-network with a payer, but that is typically just as part of a negotiation or renegotiation process of our contract. So we haven't yet seen any fundamental change in the payer environment and have been successful within the division renewing some significant contracts in the last 3 to 4 months there over multi-years and continue to be on favorable terms. So certainly the legislative environment is changing to give consumers a better position in dealing with out-of-network situations.

Good management, and I agree with him on that, but I'll let him add detail. But in all candor, it's stronger than expected.

It has sustained that for some period of time and couple that with the expanded coverage. We obviously can explain part of the utilization that's all been going on, but I think there's a couple of other factors, and Phillip is the expert on the consumerism piece. He studies that more than anybody else, but I would add one wildcard, I think that fuel prices have been lower for some time now, and that discretionary income has influenced healthcare spending for the lower ticket items. And I think we see that. And you couple that with consumerism. And I think more awareness now about the price point, the value proposition of the freestanding surgery centers. And what we hear, and I'll hand it over to Phillip, we have a physician leadership group from each of our service lines, and they tell us what they see in the field.

I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum from 2015 has carried over into the first quarter of 2016, and it's driving 27% growth in our net revenues, now totaling $725 million with same -- strong same-center and same-contract rev",531,"Thank you, Claire. I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum from 2015 has carried over into the first quarter of 2016, and it's driving 27% growth in our net revenues, now totaling $725 million with same -- strong same-center and same-contract revenue growth for the Ambulatory Surgery and Physician Services divisions. We are modifying our guidance to reflect that strength in Q1, and Claire will have more on that shortly.
Let's now move to the performance highlights for the quarter. Overall, our adjusted EPS increased by 32% at $0.82 a share and $0.02 above the top end of our previous guidance. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $120 million, up 28% over prior-year prior-quarter. For that same period, adjusted net earnings increased 47% to $47 million. And we completed 2 additional Physician Services transaction and 1 additional ASC transaction this year, one of those in the first quarter. Our focus, since the fourth quarter of last year and into the first quarter of this year, has really been in large part on the integration of the large acquisitions that we completed late last year, but I'm pleased to report that the pipelines remain very solid in both service lines, and we believe our projections for growth are very achievable. Claire is going to provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our guidance in her comments.
Now speaking directly on -- specifically to the Ambulatory Services division, again, on a prior-year prior-quarter basis, our same-center revenue growth for the division was 8.8%; our net revenues increased 8% to $307 million, and keeping in mind that this now includes the impact of noncenters that were deconsolidated in 2015. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $54 million. Our margins increased 80 basis points. The ASC division contributed 42% of our total revenue in the quarter, which is down from the 50% in the same quarter of '15, representing a significant shift in our mix of business towards Physician Services. We still are strongly very bullish on the ASC division. We just had a really strong year in development last year, which has now tipped the scale in the favor of Physician Services. The division also ended the quarter with 256 centers and 1 surgical hospital. The count there are 151 GI centers, 38 ophthalmology centers and 67 multispecialty centers. We ended the quarter with 6 centers under LOI and 1 center in development.
For Physician Services, net revenues increased 46% to $418 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 43% to $66.5 million. Our same-contract revenue growth for the division was 12%, and the division contributed 58% of the company's total revenue. And within that, our anesthesia service contributed 42% of the total consolidated AmSurg revenue. There's a very active pipeline in the Physician Services verticals, and during the quarter, as I mentioned, we added 1 group to our children services network in the Phoenix, Arizona market, and subsequent to the quarter, we added a significant anesthesia group in Northeast Florida.
We are off to a solid start again in Q2, and now with that, I'll turn the call over to Claire to discuss the results for Q1 and to present revised guidance for 2016."

As Chris stated, we are pleased to report a strong start to 2016. Our revenues increased 27% to $725 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $0.82, driven by our strong organic growth in both Ambulatory and Physician Services and by acquisitions completed primarily in the fourth quarter of '15. The growth in our adjusted earnings per share is inclusive of the 12% increase in our diluted shares outstanding due to our December 2015 equity offering.
Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to $6.579 million for the quarter compared to $2.651 million in the prior year due to the deconsolidation of nonadditional ASCs in '15. Adjusted EBITDA grew 28% to $120 million for the quarter and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.6%. As anticipated, our adjusted EBITDA margin is negatively impacted in the first quarter each year due to higher salary-related costs, primarily in the Physician Services Division.
Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $3 million for the quarter and maintenance CapEx was $13 million. Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interest was $26 million for the quarter, below our first quarter '15 operating cash flow of $52 million due to several items. We had incentive comp payouts this year of approximately $16 million more than prior year. We had higher tax payments of $9 million more than last year as we were in a tax receivable position in the first quarter of '15. In addition, we had an increase in our accounts receivable of $15 million during the quarter. This increase was driven by 2 factors: first, temporary delayed billing from cash collections at recent acquisitions as we go through the change of ownership process. And secondly, by delayed collections from our implementation of ICD-10, which caused a backlog in billings in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was 40%. Our cash balance at quarter-end was $86 million, and our total debt was $2.4 billion, and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage remained at 4.1x at quarter-end.
In our Ambulatory Services operations, ASC revenue increased 8% to $307 million and same-center revenues increased 8.8% during the quarter. Procedures per day increased 5%. The extra day in the quarter contributed 1.7%, and we had a 2.1% increase in net revenue per procedure. The revenue per procedure growth is due primarily to the remaining tail on Anesthesia Services initiated at 6 of our GI centers in 2015 as well as normal rate increases. We will begin to anniversary the impact of these new Anesthesia Services in the second quarter.
Adjusted net EBITDA was $54 million, a 13% increase over the prior year and our EBITDA margin was 17.5%. Revenue was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 5.5% of the revenue in the first quarter of '15. In Physician Services operations, net revenues for the quarter was $418 million, an increase of 46% over the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions contributed 34.4% and contract revenue contributed 10.1% and net new contracts contributed 1.2%. Direct practice expenses were $320 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $66.5 million, an increase of 43% over the prior year quarter and the EBITDA margin was 15.9%. Same-contract revenue growth was 12% for the quarter. Patient encounters per day were up 7.3%. The extra day contributed 1.7% and net revenue-per-encounter increased 3%. This strong volume growth was again positively impacted by volume from the exchanges, improving employment rates and the expansion in the number of ORs at some of our larger hospital clients. A large portion of this revenue-per-encounter increase resulted from a delay in the recognition of exchange revenue between Q1 and Q2 of 2015. 
Today, we are reiterating and adjusting certain metrics of our full year 2016 guidance range and establishing second quarter guidance as follows: annual revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion unchanged; same-center revenue increase of 4% to 6% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services; new contract growth continues to be expected in a range of 1% to 2%; adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $601 million; adjusted EPS in the range of $4.28 to $4.35; and adjusted EPS for the second quarter in the range of $1.06 to $1.09.

It's really hard for us to tell you what that number might be. It could be as much as 1%, but I doubt it would be more than that. Obviously, the rate increases for the ASC division, which were 2.1% this quarter, will -- approximately half of that will begin to anniversary in the second quarter of this year, as we started those programs in the second quarter of last year. On the Physician Services side, I think it's really hard on the volume number to really parse out anything else other than that extra day. But on the rate side, I think probably half of the rate increase was driven by some of the adjustments that we made to revenue recognition last year between Q1 and Q2."

Fortunately, I think the company, strategically, has always operated mostly in in-network fashion, so today, that is still predominantly the manner in which we're operating within Physician Services. From time to time, in a certain market, we may be out-of-network with a payer, but that is typically just as part of a negotiation or renegotiation process of our contract. So we haven't yet seen any fundamental change in the payer environment and have been successful within the division renewing some significant contracts in the last 3 to 4 months there over multi-years and continue to be on favorable terms. So certainly the legislative environment is changing to give consumers a better position in dealing with out-of-network situations.

A positive momentum for AmSurg continued in Q2 2016, driving 18% growth in net revenues totaling $759 million, with solid same-center and same-contract revenue growth in both the ambulatory surgery and Physician Services divisions. We had a particularly busy quarter for acquisitions, again, in both Physician Services and ambulatory surgery. Now let me move to the performance highlights for the quarter. In total, consolidated, our adjusted EPS increased by 13% at $1.10 per share, which was $0.01 above the top end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA totaled $149 million, up 17%. Adjusted net earnings increased 39% versus prior year to $44 million and we have completed 5 additional Physician Services transaction and acquired 4 additional ASCs to the first half of 2016 and we have deployed nearly $300 million of our capital for acquisitions. We expect to achieve our M&A targets for the year as the pipeline remains very solid in both services. Claire's going to provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our guidance in her comments. But let me give a little more color on the Ambulatory Surgery services division. On a prior year basis, our same-center revenue growth for the division was 4.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4% to $62 million. The division contributed over 42% of our total revenue in the quarter and it ended the quarter with 258 centers and 1 surgical hospital. Included in that count are 154 GI centers, 38 eye centers and 66 multispecialty centers. We also ended the quarter with 4 centers under letter of intent and 1 center under development. Three of those centers under LOI have closed subsequent to quarter end. So over the past 2 years, we have increased the number of centers joint venture with health systems from 10 to 32. Today, we have ASC equity relationships with over 20 health systems and a strong pipeline for additional relationships. And most recently, in the transactions completed subsequent to quarter end included 2 ASCs that were centers and leads that were generated through an existing Sheridan Physician Services relationship. Now the Physician Services. There, revenue increased 33% to $439 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% to $88 million. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter and the division contributed 58% of AmSurg's total revenue. Our anesthesia service contributed 42% of the total consolidated AmSurg revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, we added 5 practices to our platform including 1 radiology practice and 4 anesthesia practices. So with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Claire Gulmi to discuss the results for Q2."

Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $7.3 million for t",1001,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris said, for the quarter, our revenues increased 18%, $759 million and our adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.10. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $7.3 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year due to the deconsolidation of non-ASC in 2015. We disposed of 2 multispecialty centers and deconsolidated 1 GI Center during the quarter and recorded a gain on those transaction of $2.6 million. This said gain is not included in our adjusted EBITDA. We also reported a change in the valuation of the contingent purchase price payable generating income of $2.6 million and again, this item is not included on our adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to $149.2 million for the quarter and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.7%. Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $281 million for the quarter as we completed none [ph] acquisitions during the quarter. We have now completed 75% of our budgeted acquisition spend for the year and are well on our way to meeting this annual target. However, the timing late in the quarter for these acquisitions did impact our revenue for the quarter and will impact our revenue guidance for the year. Maintenance CapEx was $21 million, higher than past quarters due to build out of our new Sheridan office space. Our net operating cash flow, less distributions to noncontrolling interest, was $54 million, lower than the priory year due to several items, most of which are timing issues that will turn around in the third quarter. Tax payments were higher by $30 million in the quarter and we are now in the receivable position so there will not be material tax payments in the third quarter. We continue to see an increase in accounts receivable, about $7 million in the quarter due to a backlog in days into charges and our Physician Services segment. This backlog has been substantially reduced and we should see better cash collections in the third quarter. Our July cash collections were much higher than our second quarter runway. We had an extra payroll in the quarter compared to prior year which impacted cash by $15 million and finally, we made a refund to a payer who have been overpaying us over a 2-year period of $15 million. Our cash flow in the third and fourth quarter should be our strongest and we continue to project approximately $350 million in operating cash flow for the year. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was 41%, higher than our projected 40% due to a discrete valuation allowance on the capital loss incurred from our 2 dispositions during the quarter. Our tax rate is projected to be 40% for the remainder of the year. Our cash balance at quarter-end was $74 million and our total debt was $2.6 billion. Our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x at quarter-end. In our Ambulatory Services operation, ASC revenue increased three percent to $320 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015 which represented approximately 5.9% of revenue in the second quarter of '15. Same-center revenues increased 4.2% during the quarter. Procedures increased to 3.3% and net revenue per procedure increased 1.1%. Adjusted net EBITDA was $62 million, a 2.4% increase over the prior year and our EBITDA margin was 19.3%. This EBITDA growth rate was impacted by the higher corporate incentive comp as we continue to exceed our budget and by some lower margins during the quarter and a few of our multispecialty centers. Three of our centers were closed during the portion of the quarter due to what her intrusion and several of our centers were impacted by payroll issue where new contracts were loaded with an incorrect payment rate. Both of these should be resolved over the next quarter. In July, CMS announced the proposed updates to the ASC rates for 2017 due to proposed reduction in several GI codes, we were expecting a 1.8% reduction in Medicare revenue or $5 million in 2017 if those rates are enacted as proposed. In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $439 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 27.5%. Same-contract revenue contributed 4.5% and net new contract contributed 0.6%. Direct practice expenses were $322 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.5 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year quarter and the EBITDA margin was 19.9%. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter. Patient encounters per day were up 5.1% and net revenue-per-encounter increased 0.4%. Included in this 0.4% revenue increase is a 2.2% increase in rate, a 0.2% increase in acuity, offset by negative 2% shift in payer mix. New contract revenue was 0.4% for the quarter. We had a strong quarter for new contract wins and are on target to meet or exceed our expected wins for the year. However, the timing of the start of this new contract is later in the year than anticipated and will impact our revenue projection for the year. Because new contract goes through a ramp-up period, these later starts will have little impact on our projected net earnings for the year. Today, we are adjusting our full year 2016 revenue guidance range to reflect the timing difference in our acquisitions and new contracts starts and we are reiterating the remaining guidance and establishing third quarter guidance as follows: Annual revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.09 billion; same-store revenue increase of 4% to 6% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services. Adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $601 million. Adjusted EPS in the range of $4.28 to $4.35 and adjusted EPS for the third quarter in a range of $1.10 to $1.13. Our third quarter guidance reflects expected seasonality with a projected return to higher growth in the fourth quarter. At this time, operator, I'll open it up to questions."

As you're all aware, we announced our pending merger with Envision in mid-June of this year, and we expect to satisfy all relevant conditions and approvals necessary to complete that merger in Q4 of 2016. Both management teams continue",524,"Thank you, Claire. As you're all aware, we announced our pending merger with Envision in mid-June of this year, and we expect to satisfy all relevant conditions and approvals necessary to complete that merger in Q4 of 2016. Both management teams continue to collaborate effectively on the integration planning efforts. The reaction from all of our internal and external stakeholders continues to be very positive, and we are looking forward to the launch of this transformative combination. And we remain very confident in our strategic direction and our opportunities for growth. 
A positive momentum for AMSURG continued in Q2 2016, driving 18% growth in net revenues totaling $759 million, with solid same-center and same-contract revenue growth in both the Ambulatory Surgery and Physician Services divisions. We had a particularly busy quarter for acquisitions, again, in both Physician Services and Ambulatory Surgery. 
Now let me move to the performance highlights for the quarter. In total -- consolidated, our adjusted EPS increased by 13% at $1.10 per share, which was $0.01 above the top end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA totaled $149 million, up 17%. Adjusted net earnings increased 39% versus prior year to $44 million, and we have completed 5 additional Physician Services transaction and acquired 4 additional ASCs through the first half of 2016, and we have deployed nearly $300 million of our capital for acquisitions. We expect to achieve our M&A targets for the year as the pipeline remains very solid in both services. 
Claire's going to provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our guidance in her comments, but let me give a little more color on the Ambulatory Surgery Services division. On a prior year basis, our same-center revenue growth for the division was 4.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4% to $62 million. The division contributed over 42% of our total revenue in the quarter, and it ended the quarter with 258 centers and 1 surgical hospital. Included in that count are 154 GI centers, 38 eye centers and 66 multi-specialty centers. We also ended the quarter with 4 centers under letter of intent and 1 center under development. Three of those centers under LOI have closed subsequent to quarter end. So over the past 2 years, we have increased the number of centers' joint venture with health systems from 10 to 32. Today, we have ASC equity relationships with over 20 health systems and a strong pipeline for additional relationships. And most recently, in the transactions completed subsequent to quarter end included 2 ASCs that were centers and leads that were generated through an existing Sheridan Physician Services relationship. 
Now the Physician Services. There, the net revenue increased 33% to $439 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% to $88 million. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter, and the division contributed 58% of AMSURG's total revenue. Our anesthesia service contributed 42% of the total consolidated AMSURG revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, we added 5 practices to our platform, including 1 radiology practice and 4 anesthesia practices. 
So with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Claire Gulmi to discuss the results for Q2."

As Chris said, for the quarter, our revenues increased 18% to $759 million, and our adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.10. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $7.3 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year due to the deconsolidation of non-ASCs in 2015. We disposed of 2 multi-specialty centers and deconsolidated 1 GI center during the quarter and recorded a gain on those transactions of $2.6 million. This net gain is not included in our adjusted EBITDA. We also reported a change in the valuation of a contingent purchase price payable, generating income of $2.6 million, and again, this item is not included in our adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to $149.2 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.7%. 
Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $281 million for the quarter as we completed 9 acquisitions during the quarter. We have now completed 75% of our budgeted acquisition spend for the year and are well on our way to meeting this annual target. However, the timing late in the quarter for these acquisitions did impact our revenue for the quarter and will impact our revenue guidance for the year. Maintenance CapEx was $21 million higher than past quarters due to build-out of our new Sheridan office space. 
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interest was $54 million lower than the priory year due to several items, most of which are timing issues that will turn around in the third quarter. Tax payments were higher by $30 million in the quarter, and we are now in a receivable position so there will not be material tax payments in the third quarter. We continue to see an increase in accounts receivable of about $7 million in the quarter due to a backlog in days to inter-charges in our Physician Services segment. This backlog has been substantially reduced, and we should see better cash collections in the third quarter. Our July cash collections were much higher than our second quarter runway. We had an extra payroll in the quarter compared to prior year, which impacted cash by $15 million. And finally, we made a refund to a payer who has been overpaying us over a 2-year period of $15 million. 
Our cash flow in the third and fourth quarter should be our strongest, and we continue to project approximately $350 million in operating cash flow for the year. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was 41%, higher than our projected 40% due to a discrete valuation allowance on the capital loss incurred from our 2 dispositions during the quarter. Our tax rate is projected to be 40% for the remainder of the year. Our cash balance at quarter end was $74 million, and our total debt was $2.6 billion. Our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x at quarter end. 
In our Ambulatory Services operation, ASC revenue increased 3% to $320 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 5.9% of revenue in the second quarter of '15. Same-center revenues increased 4.2% during the quarter. Procedures increased to 3.3%, and net revenue per procedure increased 1.1%. Adjusted net EBITDA was $62 million, a 2.4% increase over the prior year; and our EBITDA margin was 19.3%. This EBITDA growth rate was impacted by the higher corporate incentive comp as -- by higher corporate incentive comp as we continue to exceed our budget and by some lower margins during the quarter in a few of our multi-specialty centers. 
Three of our centers were closed during the portion of the quarter due to water intrusion, and several of our centers were impacted by payer issue where new contracts were loaded with an incorrect payment rate. Both of these should be resolved over the next quarter. 
In July, CMS announced the proposed updates to the ASC rates for 2017 due to proposed reductions in several GI codes. We are expecting a 1.8% reduction in Medicare revenue or $5 million in 2017 if those rates are enacted as proposed. 
In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $439 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 27.5%. Same-contract revenue contributed 4.5%, and net new contracts contributed 0.6%. Direct practice expenses were $322 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.5 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter; and the EBITDA margin was 19.9%. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter. Patient encounters per day were up 5.1%, and net revenue per encounter increased 0.4%. Included in this 0.4% revenue increase is a 2.2% increase in rate, a 0.2% increase in acuity, offset by negative 2% shift in payer mix. 
New contract revenue was 0.4% for the quarter. We had a strong quarter for new contract wins and are on target to meet or exceed our expected wins for the year. However, the timing of the start of this new contract is later in the year than anticipated and will impact our revenue projection for the year. Because new contract goes through a ramp-up period, these later starts will have little impact on our projected net earnings for the year. 
Today, we are adjusting our full year 2016 revenue guidance range to reflect the timing difference in our acquisitions and new contracts starts, and we are reiterating the remaining guidance and establishing third quarter guidance as follows: Annual revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.09 billion, same-center revenue increase of 4% to 6% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services, adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $601 million, adjusted EPS in a range of $4.28 to $4.35 and adjusted EPS for the third quarter in a range of $1.10 to $1.13. Our third quarter guidance reflects expected seasonality with a projected return to higher growth in the fourth quarter.

As you're all aware, we announced our pending merger with Envision in mid-June of this year, and we expect to satisfy all relevant conditions and approvals necessary to complete that merger in Q4 of 2016. Both management teams continue",524,"Thank you, Claire. As you're all aware, we announced our pending merger with Envision in mid-June of this year, and we expect to satisfy all relevant conditions and approvals necessary to complete that merger in Q4 of 2016. Both management teams continue to collaborate effectively on the integration planning efforts. The reaction from all of our internal and external stakeholders continues to be very positive, and we are looking forward to the launch of this transformative combination. And we remain very confident in our strategic direction and our opportunities for growth. 
A positive momentum for AMSURG continued in Q2 2016, driving 18% growth in net revenues totaling $759 million, with solid same-center and same-contract revenue growth in both the Ambulatory Surgery and Physician Services divisions. We had a particularly busy quarter for acquisitions, again, in both Physician Services and Ambulatory Surgery. 
Now let me move to the performance highlights for the quarter. In total -- consolidated, our adjusted EPS increased by 13% at $1.10 per share, which was $0.01 above the top end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA totaled $149 million, up 17%. Adjusted net earnings increased 39% versus prior year to $44 million, and we have completed 5 additional Physician Services transactions and acquired 4 additional ASCs through the first half of 2016, and we have deployed nearly $300 million of our capital for acquisitions. We expect to achieve our M&A targets for the year as the pipeline remains very solid in both services. 
Claire's going to provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our guidance in her comments, but let me give a little more color on the Ambulatory Surgery Services division. On a prior year basis, our same-center revenue growth for the division was 4.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4% to $62 million. The division contributed over 42% of our total revenue in the quarter, and it ended the quarter with 258 centers and 1 surgical hospital. Included in that count are 154 GI centers, 38 eye centers and 66 multi-specialty centers. We also ended the quarter with 4 centers under letter of intent and 1 center under development. Three of those centers under LOI have closed subsequent to quarter end. So over the past 2 years, we have increased the number of centers' joint venture with health systems from 10 to 32. Today, we have ASC equity relationships with over 20 health systems and a strong pipeline for additional relationships. And most recently, in the transactions completed subsequent to quarter end included 2 ASCs that were centers and leads that were generated through an existing Sheridan Physician Services relationship. 
Now to Physician Services. There, the net revenue increased 33% to $439 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% to $88 million. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter, and the division contributed 58% of AMSURG's total revenue. Our anesthesia service contributed 42% of the total consolidated AMSURG revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, we added 5 practices to our platform, including 1 radiology practice and 4 anesthesia practices. 
So with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Claire Gulmi to discuss the results for Q2."

As Chris said, for the quarter, our revenues increased 18% to $759 million, and our adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.10. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $7.3 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year due to the deconsolidation of non-ASCs in 2015. We disposed of 2 multi-specialty centers and deconsolidated 1 GI center during the quarter and recorded a gain on those transactions of $2.6 million. This net gain is not included in our adjusted EBITDA. We also reported a change in the valuation of a contingent purchase price payable, generating income of $2.6 million, and again, this item is not included in our adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to $149.2 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.7%. 
Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $281 million for the quarter as we completed 9 acquisitions during the quarter. We have now completed 75% of our budgeted acquisition spend for the year and are well on our way to meeting this annual target. However, the timing late in the quarter for these acquisitions did impact our revenue for the quarter and will impact our revenue guidance for the year. Maintenance CapEx was $21 million higher than past quarters due to build-out of our new Sheridan office space. 
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interest was $54 million lower than the prior year due to several items, most of which are timing issues that will turn around in the third quarter. Tax payments were higher by $30 million in the quarter, and we are now in a receivable position so there will not be material tax payments in the third quarter. We continue to see an increase in accounts receivable of about $7 million in the quarter due to a backlog in days to entered charges in our Physician Services segment. This backlog has been substantially reduced, and we should see better cash collections in the third quarter. Our July cash collections were much higher than our second quarter runway. We had an extra payroll in the quarter compared to prior year, which impacted cash by $15 million. And finally, we made a refund to a payer who has been overpaying us over a 2-year period of $15 million. 
Our cash flow in the third and fourth quarter should be our strongest, and we continue to project approximately $350 million in operating cash flow for the year. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was 41%, higher than our projected 40% due to a discrete valuation allowance on the capital loss incurred from our 2 dispositions during the quarter. Our tax rate is projected to be 40% for the remainder of the year. Our cash balance at quarter end was $74 million, and our total debt was $2.6 billion. Our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x at quarter end. 
In our Ambulatory Services operation, ASC revenue increased 3% to $320 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 5.9% of revenue in the second quarter of '15. Same-center revenues increased 4.2% during the quarter. Procedures increased 3.3%, and net revenue per procedure increased 1.1%. Adjusted net EBITDA was $62 million, a 2.4% increase over the prior year; and our EBITDA margin was 19.3%. This EBITDA growth rate was impacted by the higher corporate incentive comp as -- by higher corporate incentive comp as we continue to exceed our budget and by some lower margins during the quarter in a few of our multi-specialty centers. 
Three of our centers were closed during a portion of the quarter due to water intrusion, and several of our centers were impacted by a payer issue where new contracts were loaded with an incorrect payment rate. Both of these should be resolved over the next quarter. 
In July, CMS announced the proposed updates to the ASC rates for 2017. Due to proposed reductions in several GI codes, we are expecting a 1.8% reduction in Medicare revenue or $5 million in 2017 if those rates are enacted as proposed. 
In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $439 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 27.5%. Same-contract revenue contributed 4.5%, and net new contracts contributed 0.6%. Direct practice expenses were $322 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.5 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter; and the EBITDA margin was 19.9%. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter. Patient encounters per day were up 5.1%, and net revenue per encounter increased 0.4%. Included in this 0.4% revenue increase is a 2.2% increase in rate, a 0.2% increase in acuity, offset by a negative 2% shift in payer mix. 
New contract revenue was 0.4% for the quarter. We had a strong quarter for new contract wins and are on target to meet or exceed our expected wins for the year. However, the timing of the start of this new contract is later in the year than anticipated and will impact our revenue projection for the year. Because new contracts go through a ramp-up period, these later starts will have little impact on our projected net earnings for the year. 
Today, we are adjusting our full year 2016 revenue guidance range to reflect the timing difference in our acquisitions and new contract starts, and we are reiterating the remaining guidance and establishing third quarter guidance as follows: Annual revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.09 billion, same-center revenue increase of 4% to 6% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services, adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $601 million, adjusted EPS in a range of $4.28 to $4.35 and adjusted EPS for the third quarter in a range of $1.10 to $1.13. Our third quarter guidance reflects expected seasonality with a projected return to higher growth in the fourth quarter. 
At this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

As you're all aware, we announced our pending merger with Envision in mid-June of this year, and we expect to satisfy all relevant conditions and approvals necessary to complete that merger in Q4 of 2016. Both management teams continue",524,"Thank you, Claire. As you're all aware, we announced our pending merger with Envision in mid-June of this year, and we expect to satisfy all relevant conditions and approvals necessary to complete that merger in Q4 of 2016. Both management teams continue to collaborate effectively on the integration planning efforts. The reaction from all of our internal and external stakeholders continues to be very positive, and we are looking forward to the launch of this transformative combination. And we remain very confident in our strategic direction and our opportunities for growth. 
A positive momentum for AMSURG continued in Q2 2016, driving 18% growth in net revenues totaling $759 million, with solid same-center and same-contract revenue growth in both the Ambulatory Surgery and Physician Services divisions. We had a particularly busy quarter for acquisitions, again, in both Physician Services and Ambulatory Surgery. 
Now let me move to the performance highlights for the quarter. In total -- consolidated, our adjusted EPS increased by 13% at $1.10 per share, which was $0.01 above the top end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA totaled $149 million, up 17%. Adjusted net earnings increased 39% versus prior year to $44 million, and we have completed 5 additional Physician Services transactions and acquired 4 additional ASCs through the first half of 2016, and we have deployed nearly $300 million of our capital for acquisitions. We expect to achieve our M&A targets for the year as the pipeline remains very solid in both services. 
Claire's going to provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our guidance in her comments, but let me give a little more color on the Ambulatory Surgery Services division. On a prior year basis, our same-center revenue growth for the division was 4.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4% to $62 million. The division contributed over 42% of our total revenue in the quarter, and it ended the quarter with 258 centers and 1 surgical hospital. Included in that count are 154 GI centers, 38 eye centers and 66 multi-specialty centers. We also ended the quarter with 4 centers under letter of intent and 1 center under development. Three of those centers under LOI have closed subsequent to quarter end. So over the past 2 years, we have increased the number of centers' joint venture with health systems from 10 to 32. Today, we have ASC equity relationships with over 20 health systems and a strong pipeline for additional relationships. And most recently, in the transactions completed subsequent to quarter end included 2 ASCs that were centers and leads that were generated through an existing Sheridan Physician Services relationship. 
Now to Physician Services. There, the net revenue increased 33% to $439 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% to $88 million. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter, and the division contributed 58% of AMSURG's total revenue. Our anesthesia service contributed 42% of the total consolidated AMSURG revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, we added 5 practices to our platform, including 1 radiology practice and 4 anesthesia practices. 
So with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Claire Gulmi to discuss the results for Q2."

As Chris said, for the quarter, our revenues increased 18% to $759 million, and our adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.10. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $7.3 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year due to the deconsolidation of non-ASCs in 2015. We disposed of 2 multi-specialty centers and deconsolidated 1 GI center during the quarter and recorded a gain on those transactions of $2.6 million. This net gain is not included in our adjusted EBITDA. We also reported a change in the valuation of a contingent purchase price payable, generating income of $2.6 million, and again, this item is not included in our adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to $149.2 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.7%. 
Acquisition and development capital expenditures were $281 million for the quarter as we completed 9 acquisitions during the quarter. We have now completed 75% of our budgeted acquisition spend for the year and are well on our way to meeting this annual target. However, the timing late in the quarter for these acquisitions did impact our revenue for the quarter and will impact our revenue guidance for the year. Maintenance CapEx was $21 million higher than past quarters due to build-out of our new Sheridan office space. 
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interest was $54 million lower than the prior year due to several items, most of which are timing issues that will turn around in the third quarter. Tax payments were higher by $30 million in the quarter, and we are now in a receivable position so there will not be material tax payments in the third quarter. We continue to see an increase in accounts receivable of about $7 million in the quarter due to a backlog in days to entered charges in our Physician Services segment. This backlog has been substantially reduced, and we should see better cash collections in the third quarter. Our July cash collections were much higher than our second quarter runway. We had an extra payroll in the quarter compared to prior year, which impacted cash by $15 million. And finally, we made a refund to a payer who has been overpaying us over a 2-year period of $15 million. 
Our cash flow in the third and fourth quarter should be our strongest, and we continue to project approximately $350 million in operating cash flow for the year. Our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was 41%, higher than our projected 40% due to a discrete valuation allowance on the capital loss incurred from our 2 dispositions during the quarter. Our tax rate is projected to be 40% for the remainder of the year. Our cash balance at quarter end was $74 million, and our total debt was $2.6 billion. Our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x at quarter end. 
In our Ambulatory Services operation, ASC revenue increased 3% to $320 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 5.9% of revenue in the second quarter of '15. Same-center revenues increased 4.2% during the quarter. Procedures increased 3.3%, and net revenue per procedure increased 1.1%. Adjusted net EBITDA was $62 million, a 2.4% increase over the prior year; and our EBITDA margin was 19.3%. This EBITDA growth rate was impacted by the higher corporate incentive comp as -- by higher corporate incentive comp as we continue to exceed our budget and by some lower margins during the quarter in a few of our multi-specialty centers. 
Three of our centers were closed during a portion of the quarter due to water intrusion, and several of our centers were impacted by a payer issue where new contracts were loaded with an incorrect payment rate. Both of these should be resolved over the next quarter. 
In July, CMS announced the proposed updates to the ASC rates for 2017. Due to proposed reductions in several GI codes, we are expecting a 1.8% reduction in Medicare revenue or $5 million in 2017 if those rates are enacted as proposed. 
In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $439 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 27.5%. Same-contract revenue contributed 4.5%, and net new contracts contributed 0.6%. Direct practice expenses were $322 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.5 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter; and the EBITDA margin was 19.9%. Same-contract revenue growth was 5.5% for the quarter. Patient encounters per day were up 5.1%, and net revenue per encounter increased 0.4%. Included in this 0.4% revenue increase is a 2.2% increase in rate, a 0.2% increase in acuity, offset by a negative 2% shift in payer mix. 
New contract revenue was 0.4% for the quarter. We had a strong quarter for new contract wins and are on target to meet or exceed our expected wins for the year. However, the timing of the start of this new contract is later in the year than anticipated and will impact our revenue projection for the year. Because new contracts go through a ramp-up period, these later starts will have little impact on our projected net earnings for the year. 
Today, we are adjusting our full year 2016 revenue guidance range to reflect the timing difference in our acquisitions and new contract starts, and we are reiterating the remaining guidance and establishing third quarter guidance as follows: Annual revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.09 billion, same-center revenue increase of 4% to 6% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 4% to 6% for Physician Services, adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $601 million, adjusted EPS in a range of $4.28 to $4.35 and adjusted EPS for the third quarter in a range of $1.10 to $1.13. Our third quarter guidance reflects expected seasonality with a projected return to higher growth in the fourth quarter. 
At this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

Let me begin by saying that we're pleased to report that we're making great progress on -- towards our transformational merger with Envision Healthcare. We have received the required regulatory approvals including those from the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The special meeting of our shareholders is now scheduled for November 28, and we do expect to close the merger by the end of 2016.
Over the past month, you may have noticed that we announced our new board and also our C-suite executive team. We continue to refine our integration plan with the goal of blending the best talent and best practices from both organizations and solidifying our pathway to the $35 million in cost synergies planned for 2017. The process has been collaborative and collegial since we began, and there's a remarkable positive enthusiasm and a culture of high energy, which is fueling what's an extraordinary amount of work that's going on behind the scenes as we prepare to launch our new organization. Our team recognizes that this merger creates a highly differentiated health care services company, offering a unique and important combination of solutions, including outsourced physician services, ambulatory surgery, post-acute care and medical transportation, with the mission to help build high-performing networks by focusing on service excellence, scale and enhanced coordination of care and with the vision of becoming the most trusted partner to our health system, payer, community and physician customers and colleagues.
We're very excited about our positioning and our future prospects. And before we dive into the specific results for the quarter, I want to make sure that the audience is aware that our Q3 results reflect the consolidation of an existing joint venture, and this -- the impact of this change increases our revenues and operating expenses but does not affect the presentation of our profitability. And Claire is going to address the impact of that in her comments and normalize the results accordingly.
Now let me shift my comments to the results for Q3. Overall, all operating performance -- our operating performance reflected continued positive momentum and strong operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% year-over-year. Same-contract growth increased by 7.5% in Physician Services and 2.3% for the ASC division. Year-to-date, we've deployed over $350 million in capital for acquisitions and expect to reach our goal of $400 million for the full year, and pipelines remain solid in both divisions. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.13 per share at the top end of our guidance. Adjusted net earnings increased 22% versus prior year Q3 to a total of $65 million. And Claire will, again, provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our 2016 guidance in her comments. 
For Q3, on a prior year quarter comparison basis, adjusted for the Ambulatory Services division, adjusted EBITDA increased 10.4%. It -- the division contributed 33% of our total net revenue, and we ended the quarter with 260 centers and 1 surgical hospital. That is comprised of 155 GI centers, 38 ophthalmology centers and 67 orthopedic and multi-specialty centers. We acquired 3 centers and divested 1 center in the quarter and ended the quarter with 2 centers under LOI and 1 center under development. 
For Physician Services, adjusted EBITDA increased 18%. Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, and the division contributed 62% of the total net revenue for the quarter for the company. We added 2 anesthesia physician practices to our platform during the quarter. 
So with those details, I'll now turn the call over to Claire to discuss the results for Q3."
387568,403746055,1068929,"AmSurg Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Envision Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated Physician Services joint venture. This consolidation increased the third quarter revenues by $35 million and impact",830,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated Physician Services joint venture. This consolidation increased the third quarter revenues by $35 million and impacted our margin. For comparative purposes, I will try to highlight various metrics before and after the consolidation throughout my remarks. 
Our revenues increased 26% to $822 million, with the new consolidated revenue contributing 5% to this growth. Transaction costs increased to $16.9 million, related primarily to the Envision merger, and during the quarter, we recorded a $4 million gain on the sale of a surgery center. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $4.4 million for the quarter, lower than the second quarter of this year due to this JV consolidation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.13, and our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was 42.4%, higher than projected -- our projected 40% due to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the contingent earnout related to an acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $153 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.6%. This EBITDA margin would have been 19.4%, excluding the JV consolidation. 
Acquisition and development CapEx was $70 million for the quarter as we completed 5 acquisitions during the quarter. Maintenance CapEx was $27 million, which included the continuing costs related to the buildout of our new Sheridan office space.
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interests and transaction costs was $110 million. Our cash balance at quarter end was $106 million. And total debt was $2.65 billion, and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x.
In our Ambulatory Services operation, revenue increased 1.8% to $315 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 3.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Same-center revenues increased 2.3% during the quarter, procedures increased 1%, and net revenue per procedure increased 1.3%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $61.1 million, a 10.4% increase over the prior year, and our EBITDA margin was 19.4%. Typically, in the third quarter, we expected decline in EBITDA margin compared to the second quarter, but we had sequential margin improvement due to the improved performance of the centers that were impacted in the second quarter by water intrusion and payer issues and also by lower corporate overhead expenses during the quarter. The EBITDA margin improved year-over-year due to a positive 70 basis points impact from the 2015 synergy [ph] deconsolidations and by lower corporate overhead expenses.
In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $508 million, an increase of 48.8% over the prior year. Excluding the joint venture consolidation, net revenue would have increased 38.5%. Acquisitions contributed 31.6%, same-contract revenue contributed 5.9%, and net new contracts contributed 1%.
Bad debt expense was $146 million or 22.4% of Physician Services revenue. This was higher than the previous quarter due to the fact that the programs and the joint venture that are now consolidated have a higher concentration of emergency department programs, which inherently have higher bad debt expense. Excluding the JV consolidation, bad debt expense would have been 19.2% of revenue.
Direct practice expenses were $383 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $91.9 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter; and the EBITDA margin was 18.1%. Excluding the JV consolidation, the EBITDA margin would have been 19.5%. The EBITDA margin, excluding the consolidation was 330 basis points lower than the prior year, driven primarily by the margin of the acquisitions that have been completed since this time last year. The recent acquisitions have an initial lower margin than our base business, which is driving the year-over-year reduction in margin. The EBITDA margin for the same-contract group decreased by 80 basis points over the prior year due to the increase of labor costs that we have experienced throughout 2016, but they improved by 30 basis points over the second quarter of this year. 
Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, patient encounters per day were up 2.9%, and net revenue per encounter increased 4.6%. Included in this 4.6% revenue increase is a 5.4% increase in rate, offset by 0.3% decrease in acuity and a negative 0.5% shift in payer mix.

And there's still a lot of legislative activity to build out the adjudication of appropriate payment rates for out-of-network providers. So in our 2017 expectations, we do not see a material impact on our business in the state of California and the majority of our anesthesia business, the majority of payers in California, we are currently in network with only a few select PPO payers, which would be outside of the legislation. We're not in network or contract with at this time. So that's really what we're seeing as it relates to  the California legislation and I think there is a lot of active legislation in many states across the country, but again, our position is being in, in network provider and our ability to successfully renew contracts in the state of California despite legislation that has to there. I think it still speaks to -- this is a tool to adjudicate fairly what payment should be, when services are provided unexpectedly out-of-network. But the payer still want to have a dialogue with companies with our scope and our scale and what we're doing for the patients. That is a reasonable discussion about being in network."

Let me begin by saying that we're pleased to report that we're making great progress on -- towards our transformational merger with Envision Healthcare. We have received the required regulatory approvals including those from the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The special meeting of our shareholders is now scheduled for November 28, and we do expect to close the merger by the end of 2016.
Over the past month, you may have noticed that we announced our new board and also our C-suite executive team. We continue to refine our integration plan with the goal of blending the best talent and best practices from both organizations and solidifying our pathway to the $35 million in cost synergies planned for 2017. The process has been collaborative and collegial since we began, and there's a remarkable positive enthusiasm and a culture of high energy, which is fueling what's an extraordinary amount of work that's going on behind the scenes as we prepare to launch our new organization. Our team recognizes that this merger creates a highly differentiated health care services company, offering a unique and important combination of solutions, including outsourced physician services, ambulatory surgery, post-acute care and medical transportation, with the mission to help build high-performing networks by focusing on service excellence, scale and enhanced coordination of care and with the vision of becoming the most trusted partner to our health system, payer, community and physician customers and colleagues.
We're very excited about our positioning and our future prospects. And before we dive into the specific results for the quarter, I want to make sure that the audience is aware that our Q3 results reflect the consolidation of an existing joint venture, and this -- the impact of this change increases our revenues and operating expenses but does not affect the presentation of our profitability. And Claire is going to address the impact of that in her comments and normalize the results accordingly.
Now let me shift my comments to the results for Q3. Overall, all operating performance -- our operating performance reflected continued positive momentum and strong operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% year-over-year. Same-contract growth increased by 7.5% in Physician Services and 2.3% for the ASC division. Year-to-date, we've deployed over $350 million in capital for acquisitions and expect to reach our goal of $400 million for the full year, and pipelines remain solid in both divisions. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.13 per share at the top end of our guidance. Adjusted net earnings increased 22% versus prior year Q3 to a total of $65 million. And Claire will, again, provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our 2016 guidance in her comments. 
For Q3, on a prior year quarter comparison basis, adjusted for the Ambulatory Services division, adjusted EBITDA increased 10.4%. It -- the division contributed 33% of our total net revenue, and we ended the quarter with 260 centers and 1 surgical hospital. That is comprised of 155 GI centers, 38 ophthalmology centers and 67 orthopedic and multi-specialty centers. We acquired 3 centers and divested 1 center in the quarter and ended the quarter with 2 centers under LOI and 1 center under development. 
For Physician Services, adjusted EBITDA increased 18%. Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, and the division contributed 62% of the total net revenue for the quarter for the company. We added 2 anesthesia physician practices to our platform during the quarter. 
So with those details, I'll now turn the call over to Claire to discuss the results for Q3."

For comparative purposes, I will try to highlight various metrics before and after the consolidation throughout my remarks. 
Our revenues increased 26% to $822 million, with the new consolidated revenue contributing 5% to this growth. Transaction costs increased to $16.9 million, related primarily to the Envision merger, and during the quarter, we recorded a $4 million gain on the sale of a surgery center. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $4.4 million for the quarter, lower than the second quarter of this year due to this JV consolidation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.13, and our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was 42.4%, higher than projected -- our projected 40% due to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the contingent earnout related to an acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $153 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.6%. This EBITDA margin would have been 19.4%, excluding the JV consolidation. 
Acquisition and development CapEx was $70 million for the quarter as we completed 5 acquisitions during the quarter. Maintenance CapEx was $27 million, which included the continuing costs related to the buildout of our new Sheridan office space.
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interests and transaction costs was $110 million. Our cash balance at quarter end was $106 million. And total debt was $2.65 billion, and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x.
In our Ambulatory Services operation, revenue increased 1.8% to $315 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 3.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Same-center revenues increased 2.3% during the quarter, procedures increased 1%, and net revenue per procedure increased 1.3%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $61.1 million, a 10.4% increase over the prior year, and our EBITDA margin was 19.4%. Typically, in the third quarter, we expected decline in EBITDA margin compared to the second quarter, but we had sequential margin improvement due to the improved performance of the centers that were impacted in the second quarter by water intrusion and payer issues and also by lower corporate overhead expenses during the quarter. The EBITDA margin improved year-over-year due to a positive 70 basis points impact from the 2015 synergy deconsolidations and by lower corporate overhead expenses.
In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $508 million, an increase of 48.8% over the prior year. Excluding the joint venture consolidation, net revenue would have increased 38.5%. Acquisitions contributed 31.6%, same-contract revenue contributed 5.9%, and net new contracts contributed 1%.
Bad debt expense was $146 million or 22.4% of Physician Services revenue. This was higher than the previous quarter due to the fact that the programs and the joint venture that are now consolidated have a higher concentration of emergency department programs, which inherently have higher bad debt expense. Excluding the JV consolidation, bad debt expense would have been 19.2% of revenue.
Direct practice expenses were $383 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $91.9 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter; and the EBITDA margin was 18.1%. Excluding the JV consolidation, the EBITDA margin would have been 19.5%. The EBITDA margin, excluding the consolidation was 330 basis points lower than the prior year, driven primarily by the margin of the acquisitions that have been completed since this time last year. The recent acquisitions have an initial lower margin than our base business, which is driving the year-over-year reduction in margin. The EBITDA margin for the same-contract group decreased by 80 basis points over the prior year due to the increase of labor costs that we have experienced throughout 2016, but they improved by 30 basis points over the second quarter of this year. 
Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, patient encounters per day were up 2.9%, and net revenue per encounter increased 4.6%. Included in this 4.6% revenue increase is a 5.4% increase in rate, offset by 0.3% decrease in acuity and a negative 0.5% shift in payer mix. 
Today, we are increasing our full year 2016 revenue guidance range to reflect the joint venture consolidation, narrowing our full year guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and establishing fourth quarter guidance as follows: annual revenues of $3.15 billion to $3.17 billion, same-center revenue increase of 3% to 5% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 6% to 8% for Physician Services; new contract growth will be approximately 1%; adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $598 million, adjusted EPS in the range of $4.28 to $4.33 and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter in the range of $1.23 to $1.28. 
And at this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

And there is still a lot of legislative activity to build out the adjudication of appropriate payment rates for out-of-network providers. So in our 2017 expectations, we do not see a material impact on our business in the state of California and the majority of our anesthesia business and the majority of payers in California we are currently in network with. Only a few select PPO payers, which would be outside of the legislation, are -- we're not in network or contract with at this time. So that's really what we're seeing as it relates to the California legislation, and I think there is a lot of active legislation in many states across the country. But again, our position is being a network provider and our ability to successfully renew contracts in the state of Florida despite some legislation that passed there, I think, still speaks to -- this is a tool to adjudicate fairly what payment should be when services are provided unexpectedly out of network. But the payer still want to have a dialogue with companies with our scope and our scale and what we're doing for the patients. That is a reasonable discussion about being in network."

So I think that has impacted us this year. We also -- with the number of acquisitions that we've completed, a lot of those have to go through change of ownership where you have to hold bills, and so our AR has gone up, probably $15 million or $20 million because of that.

Let me begin by saying that we're pleased to report that we're making great progress on -- towards our transformational merger with Envision Healthcare. We have received the required regulatory approvals including those from the Federal",601,"Thank you, Claire. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased to report that we're making great progress on -- towards our transformational merger with Envision Healthcare. We have received the required regulatory approvals including those from the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The special meeting of our shareholders is now scheduled for November 28, and we do expect to close the merger by the end of 2016.
Over the past month, you may have noticed that we announced our new board and also our C-suite executive team. We continue to refine our integration plan with the goal of blending the best talent and best practices from both organizations and solidifying our pathway to the $35 million in cost synergies planned for 2017. The process has been collaborative and collegial since we began, and there's a remarkable positive enthusiasm and a culture of high energy, which is fueling what's an extraordinary amount of work that's going on behind the scenes as we prepare to launch our new organization. Our team recognizes that this merger creates a highly differentiated health care services company, offering a unique and important combination of solutions, including outsourced physician services, ambulatory surgery, post-acute care and medical transportation, with the mission to help build high-performing networks by focusing on service excellence, scale and enhanced coordination of care and with the vision of becoming the most trusted partner to our health system, payer, community and physician customers and colleagues.
We're very excited about our positioning and our future prospects. And before we dive into the specific results for the quarter, I want to make sure that the audience is aware that our Q3 results reflect the consolidation of an existing joint venture, and this -- the impact of this change increases our revenues and operating expenses but does not affect the presentation of our profitability. And Claire is going to address the impact of that in her comments and normalize the results accordingly.
Now let me shift my comments to the results for Q3. Overall, all operating performance -- our operating performance reflected continued positive momentum and strong operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% year-over-year. Same-contract growth increased by 7.5% in Physician Services and 2.3% for the ASC division. Year-to-date, we've deployed over $350 million in capital for acquisitions and expect to reach our goal of $400 million for the full year, and pipelines remain solid in both divisions. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.13 per share at the top end of our guidance. Adjusted net earnings increased 22% versus prior year Q3 to a total of $65 million. And Claire will, again, provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our 2016 guidance in her comments. 
For Q3, on a prior year quarter comparison basis, adjusted for the Ambulatory Services division, adjusted EBITDA increased 10.4%. It -- the division contributed 33% of our total net revenue, and we ended the quarter with 260 centers and 1 surgical hospital. That is comprised of 155 GI centers, 38 ophthalmology centers and 67 orthopedic and multi-specialty centers. We acquired 3 centers and divested 1 center in the quarter and ended the quarter with 2 centers under LOI and 1 center under development. 
For Physician Services, adjusted EBITDA increased 18%. Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, and the division contributed 62% of the total net revenue for the quarter for the company. We added 2 anesthesia physician practices to our platform during the quarter. 
So with those details, I'll now turn the call over to Claire to discuss the results for Q3."
387568,403746055,1069261,"AmSurg Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Envision Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated Physician Services joint venture. This consolidation increased the third quarter revenues by $35 million and impact",829,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated Physician Services joint venture. This consolidation increased the third quarter revenues by $35 million and impacted our margin. For comparative purposes, I will try to highlight various metrics before and after the consolidation throughout my remarks. 
Our revenues increased 26% to $822 million, with the new consolidated revenue contributing 5% to this growth. Transaction costs increased to $16.9 million, related primarily to the Envision merger, and during the quarter, we recorded a $4 million gain on the sale of a surgery center. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $4.4 million for the quarter, lower than the second quarter of this year due to this JV consolidation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.13, and our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was 42.4%, higher than projected -- our projected 40% due to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the contingent earnout related to an acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $153 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.6%. This EBITDA margin would have been 19.4%, excluding the JV consolidation. 
Acquisition and development CapEx was $70 million for the quarter as we completed 5 acquisitions during the quarter. Maintenance CapEx was $27 million, which included the continuing costs related to the buildout of our new Sheridan office space.
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interests and transaction costs was $110 million. Our cash balance at quarter end was $106 million. And total debt was $2.65 billion, and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x.
In our Ambulatory Services operation, revenue increased 1.8% to $315 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 3.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Same-center revenues increased 2.3% during the quarter, procedures increased 1%, and net revenue per procedure increased 1.3%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $61.1 million, a 10.4% increase over the prior year, and our EBITDA margin was 19.4%. Typically, in the third quarter, we expected decline in EBITDA margin compared to the second quarter, but we had sequential margin improvement due to the improved performance of the centers that were impacted in the second quarter by water intrusion and payer issues and also by lower corporate overhead expenses during the quarter. The EBITDA margin improved year-over-year due to a positive 70 basis points impact from the 2015 synergy deconsolidations and by lower corporate overhead expenses.
In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $508 million, an increase of 48.8% over the prior year. Excluding the joint venture consolidation, net revenue would have increased 38.5%. Acquisitions contributed 31.6%, same-contract revenue contributed 5.9%, and net new contracts contributed 1%.
Bad debt expense was $146 million or 22.4% of Physician Services revenue. This was higher than the previous quarter due to the fact that the programs and the joint venture that are now consolidated have a higher concentration of emergency department programs, which inherently have higher bad debt expense. Excluding the JV consolidation, bad debt expense would have been 19.2% of revenue.
Direct practice expenses were $383 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $91.9 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter; and the EBITDA margin was 18.1%. Excluding the JV consolidation, the EBITDA margin would have been 19.5%. The EBITDA margin, excluding the consolidation was 330 basis points lower than the prior year, driven primarily by the margin of the acquisitions that have been completed since this time last year. The recent acquisitions have an initial lower margin than our base business, which is driving the year-over-year reduction in margin. The EBITDA margin for the same-contract group decreased by 80 basis points over the prior year due to the increase of labor costs that we have experienced throughout 2016, but they improved by 30 basis points over the second quarter of this year. 
Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, patient encounters per day were up 2.9%, and net revenue per encounter increased 4.6%. Included in this 4.6% revenue increase is a 5.4% increase in rate, offset by 0.3% decrease in acuity and a negative 0.5% shift in payer mix. 
Today, we are increasing our full year 2016 revenue guidance range to reflect the joint venture consolidation, narrowing our full year guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and establishing fourth quarter guidance as follows: annual revenues of $3.15 billion to $3.17 billion, same-center revenue increase of 3% to 5% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 6% to 8% for Physician Services; new contract growth will be approximately 1%; adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $598 million, adjusted EPS in the range of $4.28 to $4.33 and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter in the range of $1.23 to $1.28. 
And at this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

So in our 2017 expectations, we do not see a material impact on our business in the state of California and the majority of our anesthesia business and the majority of payers in California we are currently in network with. Only a few select PPO payers, which would be outside of the legislation, are -- we're not in network or contract with at this time. So that's really what we're seeing as it relates to the California legislation, and I think there is a lot of active legislation in many states across the country. But again, our position is being a network provider and our ability to successfully renew contracts in the state of Florida despite some legislation that passed there, I think, still speaks to -- this is a tool to adjudicate fairly what payment should be when services are provided unexpectedly out of network.

Let me begin by saying that we're pleased to report that we're making great progress on -- towards our transformational merger with Envision Healthcare. We have received the required regulatory approvals including those from the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The special meeting of our shareholders is now scheduled for November 28, and we do expect to close the merger by the end of 2016.
Over the past month, you may have noticed that we announced our new board and also our C-suite executive team. We continue to refine our integration plan with the goal of blending the best talent and best practices from both organizations and solidifying our pathway to the $35 million in cost synergies planned for 2017. The process has been collaborative and collegial since we began, and there's a remarkable positive enthusiasm and a culture of high energy, which is fueling what's an extraordinary amount of work that's going on behind the scenes as we prepare to launch our new organization. Our team recognizes that this merger creates a highly differentiated health care services company, offering a unique and important combination of solutions, including outsourced physician services, ambulatory surgery, post-acute care and medical transportation, with the mission to help build high-performing networks by focusing on service excellence, scale and enhanced coordination of care and with the vision of becoming the most trusted partner to our health system, payer, community and physician customers and colleagues.
We're very excited about our positioning and our future prospects. And before we dive into the specific results for the quarter, I want to make sure that the audience is aware that our Q3 results reflect the consolidation of an existing joint venture, and this -- the impact of this change increases our revenues and operating expenses but does not affect the presentation of our profitability. And Claire is going to address the impact of that in her comments and normalize the results accordingly.
Now let me shift my comments to the results for Q3. Overall, all operating performance -- our operating performance reflected continued positive momentum and strong operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% year-over-year. Same-contract growth increased by 7.5% in Physician Services and 2.3% for the ASC division. Year-to-date, we've deployed over $350 million in capital for acquisitions and expect to reach our goal of $400 million for the full year, and pipelines remain solid in both divisions. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.13 per share at the top end of our guidance. Adjusted net earnings increased 22% versus prior year Q3 to a total of $65 million. And Claire will, again, provide additional color on the quarter and a full overview of our 2016 guidance in her comments. 
For Q3, on a prior year quarter comparison basis, adjusted for the Ambulatory Services division, adjusted EBITDA increased 10.4%. It -- the division contributed 33% of our total net revenue, and we ended the quarter with 260 centers and 1 surgical hospital. That is comprised of 155 GI centers, 38 ophthalmology centers and 67 orthopedic and multi-specialty centers. We acquired 3 centers and divested 1 center in the quarter and ended the quarter with 2 centers under LOI and 1 center under development. 
For Physician Services, adjusted EBITDA increased 18%. Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, and the division contributed 62% of the total net revenue for the quarter for the company. We added 2 anesthesia physician practices to our platform during the quarter. 
So with those details, I'll now turn the call over to Claire to discuss the results for Q3."
387568,403746055,1070469,"AmSurg Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Envision Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated Physician Services joint venture. This consolidation increased the third quarter revenues by $35 million and impact",829,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated Physician Services joint venture. This consolidation increased the third quarter revenues by $35 million and impacted our margin. For comparative purposes, I will try to highlight various metrics before and after the consolidation throughout my remarks. 
Our revenues increased 26% to $822 million, with the new consolidated revenue contributing 5% to this growth. Transaction costs increased to $16.9 million, related primarily to the Envision merger, and during the quarter, we recorded a $4 million gain on the sale of a surgery center. Equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $4.4 million for the quarter, lower than the second quarter of this year due to this JV consolidation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.13, and our tax rate on our earnings from continuing operations less earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was 42.4%, higher than projected -- our projected 40% due to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the contingent earnout related to an acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $153 million for the quarter, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.6%. This EBITDA margin would have been 19.4%, excluding the JV consolidation. 
Acquisition and development CapEx was $70 million for the quarter as we completed 5 acquisitions during the quarter. Maintenance CapEx was $27 million, which included the continuing costs related to the buildout of our new Sheridan office space.
Our net operating cash flow less distributions to noncontrolling interests and transaction costs was $110 million. Our cash balance at quarter end was $106 million. And total debt was $2.65 billion, and our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 4.2x.
In our Ambulatory Services operation, revenue increased 1.8% to $315 million. Revenue growth was impacted by the 9 centers that were deconsolidated in 2015, which represented approximately 3.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Same-center revenues increased 2.3% during the quarter, procedures increased 1%, and net revenue per procedure increased 1.3%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $61.1 million, a 10.4% increase over the prior year, and our EBITDA margin was 19.4%. Typically, in the third quarter, we expected decline in EBITDA margin compared to the second quarter, but we had sequential margin improvement due to the improved performance of the centers that were impacted in the second quarter by water intrusion and payer issues and also by lower corporate overhead expenses during the quarter. The EBITDA margin improved year-over-year due to a positive 70 basis points impact from the 2015 synergy deconsolidations and by lower corporate overhead expenses.
In our Physician Services operations, net revenue for the quarter was $508 million, an increase of 48.8% over the prior year. Excluding the joint venture consolidation, net revenue would have increased 38.5%. Acquisitions contributed 31.6%, same-contract revenue contributed 5.9%, and net new contracts contributed 1%.
Bad debt expense was $146 million or 22.4% of Physician Services revenue. This was higher than the previous quarter due to the fact that the programs and the joint venture that are now consolidated have a higher concentration of emergency department programs, which inherently have higher bad debt expense. Excluding the JV consolidation, bad debt expense would have been 19.2% of revenue.
Direct practice expenses were $383 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $91.9 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter; and the EBITDA margin was 18.1%. Excluding the JV consolidation, the EBITDA margin would have been 19.5%. The EBITDA margin, excluding the consolidation was 330 basis points lower than the prior year, driven primarily by the margin of the acquisitions that have been completed since this time last year. The recent acquisitions have an initial lower margin than our base business, which is driving the year-over-year reduction in margin. The EBITDA margin for the same-contract group decreased by 80 basis points over the prior year due to the increase of labor costs that we have experienced throughout 2016, but they improved by 30 basis points over the second quarter of this year. 
Same-contract revenue growth was 7.5% for the quarter, patient encounters per day were up 2.9%, and net revenue per encounter increased 4.6%. Included in this 4.6% revenue increase is a 5.4% increase in rate, offset by 0.3% decrease in acuity and a negative 0.5% shift in payer mix. 
Today, we are increasing our full year 2016 revenue guidance range to reflect the joint venture consolidation, narrowing our full year guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and establishing fourth quarter guidance as follows: annual revenues of $3.15 billion to $3.17 billion, same-center revenue increase of 3% to 5% for Ambulatory Services and same-contract revenue growth of 6% to 8% for Physician Services; new contract growth will be approximately 1%; adjusted EBITDA of $592 million to $598 million, adjusted EPS in the range of $4.28 to $4.33 and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter in the range of $1.23 to $1.28. 
And at this time, operator, I'll open it up for questions."

So in our 2017 expectations, we do not see a material impact on our business in the state of California and the majority of our anesthesia business and the majority of payers in California we are currently in network with. Only a few select PPO payers, which would be outside of the legislation, are -- we're not in network or contract with at this time. So that's really what we're seeing as it relates to the California legislation, and I think there is a lot of active legislation in many states across the country. But again, our position is being a network provider and our ability to successfully renew contracts in the state of Florida despite some legislation that passed there, I think, still speaks to -- this is a tool to adjudicate fairly what payment should be when services are provided unexpectedly out of network.
