I'll turn the call over to Terry who will provide additional details on results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
I'd characterize 2015 as a good year. We delivered after-tax operating earnings of nearly $1.3 billion despite challenging conditions such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and under performance of U.S. equity markets, and we returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the benefit of our broad diversification by business, by geography, by investment platform and by asset class. In 2015, Principal continues to build momentum through outstanding investment performance and expansion of distribution and our solutions-based products set. Full year 2015 total company net cash flows of $23 billion were 4% of beginning of year assets under management. As we continue to attract retain retail, retirement and institutional investors, this help drive assets under management to $527 billion at year end, despite a $28 billion drag from foreign exchange. Another major growth highlights for 2015, 5.2 [ph] Principal International's 29th consecutive quarter with positive net cash flows were $9 billion of flows for the year, plus another $21 billion of positive flows from our joint venture with China Construction Bank. On a constant-currency basis, Principal International grew reported assets under management by 20% in 2015. Double-digit earnings growth for Principal Global Investors had nearly $16 billion in positive net cash flows, record earnings for Specialty Benefits on record sales and 9% growth in premium in fees, continued traction delivering mutual funds, separately managed accounts and annuity-based income solutions, strong underlying growth in plans, participants and reoccurring deposits for our U.S. retirement businesses and strong Individual Life full year results as claims return to expected levels. As I've said, outstanding investment performance continues to be a differentiator, and these of foundation for future growth. For example, 44 of our rated mutual funds or 76% have a 4 or 5 star MorningStar rating. Additionally, as Slide 5 shows, 88%, 89% and 93% of our investment options were in the top 2 MorningStar quartiles on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. And 100% of our target date funds remain in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods and year end, driving sales and retention in this key asset class and enabling us to help more individuals achieve financial success. 
From the strong competitive position, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in 2016 and beyond. 
Next I'll provide some examples of how we continue to execute on our strategy and further position ourselves for a long term growth. The U.S. remains the largest retirement market in the world, and Principal's has maintained its leadership position for decades through exceptional service, product innovation and strong multichannel distribution. With retail mutual funds business now reporting through Principal Global Investors, Full Service Accumulation is now the majority of Retirement and Income Solutions feed or RISP. To be clear, the underlying fundamentals of this business remains strong. We continue to grow plan count across plan sizes, adding nearly 1,300 net new plans in 2015. And we continue to be a leader in start-up plans as we focus on expanding employee coverage. The Principal's core target market of small and medium-size businesses is underserved creating an ongoing opportunity for us to uniquely serve this market through our network of local offices and drive consistent growth in this segment. Full year reoccurring deposits grew $1.1 billion, up 7% versus 2014. These growth trends highlight the power of the payroll deduction component of this business. But more importantly, the work we're doing to advocate best practice plan design with employers and advisers to increase participation and savings rate to better prepare their employees for retirement. Strong alliance for relationships continue to be a key driver of sales for Retirement and Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors as well as U.S. Insurance Solutions. In 2015, 7 different advisory firms sold more than $1 billion across our offerings, with those firms averaging more than 6 products per platform. In 2015, we continue to do business with more advisors and investment added to recommended list, platforms and model portfolios. In 2015, we had good traction of plan sponsors adopting our retirement rating as plan design. The primary features of these plans are automatic enrollment and automatic savings rate increases. Additionally, we launched an innovative income option in the fourth quarter, which offers an in-plan guaranteed annuity to provide more income security for plan participants. While this business remains under pressure from volatile markets, we expect good growth in sales and flows in 2016 giving meaningful growth in the pipeline. 
Two other points I'd like to emphasize, our U.S. retirement business continues to be one of the highest performing businesses in the industry and continues to create tremendous value for the enterprise overall. Slide 6 provides an update on the fiduciary relations with the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations advancing to the Office of Management and Budget last week, final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. Though Principal remains fully engaged to help ensure the final regulation work in favor of individuals trying to save for retirement, we also remain focused on scenario planning and potential changes to business models with a particular focus on education and guidance, compliance and oversight, provision of investment information, distribution and asset retention. Absent clarity around the final rule, we're not providing a cost estimate at this time. But based on what we know today, we do not expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. The Principal has a long history of successfully adapting to complex regulations, our track record reflects the benefits of scale, products and service breadth and top tier investments, all critical to meeting the needs of the market and diversifying the business models. As with prior regulatory developments, we're well positioned and confident we'll emerge among the winners. 
Despite volatility emerging markets, Principal International continues to demonstrate that we are in the right target markets with more  key distribution partners. As an example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides our joint venture, Brasilprev, access to more than 61 million costumers. Customers, confidence and Banco do Brasil and our tax-advantaged individual retirement products help drive Brasilprev's full year net cash flow to $7 billion. This growth further strengthens Brasilprev's position as the #1 private retirement provider in Brazil in terms of net cash flow and assets. 
Additionally, we continue to gain traction in the voluntary savings market. For example, on a constant-currency basis with Chile, volunteer assets under management increased 17%, and voluntary fee income increased 25% in 2015. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of our international operations. 
Principal Global Investors, which now include retail and institutional asset management, ended 2015 with $361 billion in assets under management. Institutional sales were strong in 2015, and the pipeline is robust. The counter to broader shift in demand to more passive or low cost investment options, Principal Global Investors launched solutions in area where demand for active strategies remain strong, including multiple new real estate offerings and fixed income strategies. We'll continue to add to our ETF suite in 2016 and beyond as well as our portfolio of income solutions, which will include both funds and guaranteed income options. 
In December, The Principal earned the top spot in the category in pension and investment annual survey of Best Places to Work in Money Management. For the fourth consecutive year, this award highlights The Principal strong investment management culture and teams that successfully work to meet client's needs every day and position us to attract, retain top investment talent. 
Moving now to our insurance business, our focus on small and medium-sized business market remain a key differentiator, and we continue to find ways to improve the customer experience. In 2015, we've piloted our easy elect group benefits enrollment tool in 7 markets with meaningful improvement in voluntary participation. And we continue to help individuals understand the importance of protection to broader financial security. 
In closing, I'm optimisitc about 2016 and our long-term future despite the continued global macroeconomic volatility. Strong business fundamentals and our ability to focus on thing we can control continue to drive momentum in the generate long-term profitable growth. Terri?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a solid end",1305,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
The fourth quarter was a solid end to a good year. On a reported basis, total company after-tax operating earnings were $303 million, a 6% decrease from the prior year period reflecting macroeconomic volatility. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share were $1.02 to compared to a normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.07, down 5%. However, on a constant-currency basis, earnings per share increased 1% quarter-over-quarter. For full year 2015, reported total company after-tax earnings were nearly $1.3 billion, a 4% decrease from a record 2014. The lower reported earnings in 2015 where primarily driven by a lower variable investment income and the impact of currency translation. Year end 2015 return on equity, excluding AOCI other than the foreign-currency translation adjustment, was 14.2%. The daily average change in equity markets is an important driver of the revenue for our fee businesses. In fourth quarter 2015, despite a 6.5% point-to-point increase in the S&P 500, the daily average change for the quarter was slightly higher than 1% compared to third quarter 2015. On a full year basis, S&P 500 daily average increased approximately 7% in 2015 compared to a 17.5% increase 2014. 
As we look ahead to 2016, if the macroeconomic volatility continues as it has in January, we anticipate a slow down in revenues in our fee-based businesses. Therefore, we'll focus on things we can control and continue to manage expenses to ensure revenue and expense are aligned. With that said, we will continue to make the necessary investments to keep our competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and our teams remain focused on execution regardless of the macroeconomic environment. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results starting on Slide 8 with RISP businesses. Fourth quarter pretax operating earnings of $125 million were down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue decreased 2% from the prior year quarter primarily due to flat average account values and a decline in variable investment income. Full year 2015 net revenue increased 1% over 2014. Net investment income decreased due to lower variable investment income in 2015 compared to the higher-than-expected levels in 2014. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 31%. After normalizing for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, it was 34%. RISP had net outflows of $1.6 billion in fourth quarter 2015 despite strong sales of $3.1 billion. Fourth quarter net cash flows reflect exit of a few large cases due to M&A activity and continued pricing discipline as well as the timing of funding for new sales. As a result, we anticipate strong net cash flow as of first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 net cash flows to be 1% to 3% of beginning of period account values as we maintain our focus on balancing growth and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $62 million, a 4% increase over the year-ago quarter, primarily due to growth in account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 56%. The pension close our business had record full year sales of $1.8 billion, which are double 2014 sales. The pipeline remains strong, and opportunities in 2016 look promising. 
Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors fourth quarter pretax operating earnings were $102 million, a 2% increase over the prior year quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion, and pretax operating earnings grew 11% compared to the prior year period. Pretax return on adjusted revenue increased to 34%. Despite the industry's bias towards passive investment strategies, Principal Global Investors generated full year net cash flows of nearly $16 billion with $8 billion coming from institutional clients. This is a result of outstanding investment performance and outcome-oriented solutions that are in demand. Additionally, full year management fees increased 9% over 2014, above the 6% growth in average assets under management, demonstrating client preference for higher fee capabilities that, combined with increased scale, led to margin improvements. 
Slide 11 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $67 million. On a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to drive mid-teens earnings growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International's pretax return on net revenue was 38% after normalizing for the third quarter of 2015 impairment of intangine assets in Claritas. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $57 million, a 29% increase over the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter premium fees grew 8% compared to the prior year quarter, and the overall loss ratio remains favorable at 62%. These are very strong results even in seasonally high fourth quarter due to our focus on the small and medium-sized business market and disciplined profitable growth. 
And as shown on Slide 13, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Despite claims experience that was in line with expectations, this is at the low end of our expected range for the quarter, partially due to lower variable revenue. However, full year pretax operating earnings growth was strong year-over-year. For the quarter, total company net income was $254 million, which includes realized capital losses of $48 million. After-tax net credit related losses of $5 million were slightly better than expected. The losses related to the hedging activities were predominantly due to interest rate and equity market changes. Full year credit-related losses were $20 million, a 65% improvement over 2014 results. Unrealized gains were $1.9 billion, and the portfolio ended the year with a net gain of $1.1 billion. Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. In addition, we have always had a disciplined approach to asset/liability management, and therefore, we're not forced sellers during stressed times. At year end 2015, our energy portfolio carrying value was 95% of our value. Our overall exposure to the energy sector represents 5.7% of our total fixed maturity portfolio and 4.2% of our total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2015. Our market value exposure in high-yield energy companies as of year end 2015 was $280 million, or less than 1/2 of 1% of total U.S. invested assets. Despite the continued market volatility in the beginning of 2016, we remain confident about the strength of our investment portfolio. As outlined on Slide 14, our capital management the strategy remains balanced and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Our fee-based businesses drove nearly 70% of 2015 normalized range, which generates higher levels of deployable capital and provides greater financial flexibility.  In 2015, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, which represented nearly 90% of net income. Our balance capital deployment include: $441 million in common stock dividends; $355 million in strategic acquisitions; and $275 million in share repurchases. The full year common stock dividend was $1.50 per share. This is a 17% increase over full year 2014 as we continue to increase our payout ratio. Additionally, last night, we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in first quarter 2016. While we continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities, the current equity market volatility is also providing an opportunity to enhance shareholder value through execution of the remainder of our share buyback authorization. In 2016, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders. In closing, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth. This concludes our prepared remarks.

That said, we think that we need to have a balanced approach. We have our -- on track to increase our dividend as a percent of that total net income percentage or closer to 40% over the longer period here. But as you look at share buybacks and you look at M&A opportunities, the M&A opportunities is still very important to us. We want to have an active pipeline, we want to continue to look at that. But as you say, with the valuations as low as they currently are, it makes sense for us to actually deploy capital in terms of buying back our shares because we do believe that they are undervalued at this point in time. It's a very volatile market so we have to have that disciplined approach. But again, we're going to continue to look at capital deployment strategies and we set it at $800 million to $1 billion this year. We expect to be having a very balanced approach as we've done in the past. But as you said, the opportunities right now are very enticing for the buyback program.

The first is that decline in net flows in the second half of the year was really around some of the large cap equity strategies, particularly at Columbus Circle and Principal Global Equities, where our clients have been looking at the possible alternative and going for lower fee capabilities. Now as you saw from our flows also, we more than replaced that with the higher added value strategies that we would be specialized in, which range through high yield, real estate, small-cap areas that are less efficient markets. But net-net, it was a slightly down but still positive fourth quarter. And I'd emphasize that because many of our peer groups are seeing negative flows. One area where the peer group is seeing negative flows is sovereigns, particularly at Central Bank in sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, which are obviously under severe financial pressure. We have some business in those areas and we have not seen those outflows yet because we are seeing much stronger investment performance and we tend to be among the managers that got retained. We're hopeful that will continue, but obviously there are no guarantees. If I look at the pipeline, which I think was partly where you are going, we have had a very active last 2 months, including over the holidays and in January. And that this unusual. Usually the institutional market globally client in that period and beginning of the year, but we've seen both activity and indeed funding looking really quite positive.

So you really look at the average account value from one period to the next period. Now actual performance of those assets also come into play versus the proxy that we use. The last quarter, we talked about a significant drop point-to-point in the S&P 500. That was down 6.7% third quarter over third quarter. That has an impact on the deferred acquisition costs, and that is what we were referencing the last quarter. Now we have an expectation that you'll have anywhere from a 2% to 3% positive impact in that point-to-point time. So if you look at that 2% to 3% versus say, down nearly 7%, you're talking a 9% to 10% drop that impacts the deferred acquisition model. Now you go forward to this quarter, now the point-to-point was up 6.5% as you pointed out. Now that has an impact on the expenses, but the differential between what the expectation and what the actual point-to-point was, was much smaller this quarter and didn't have a significant impact. Again, that S&P 500 is a proxy for the movement in our actual assets. The actual asset movement was also impacted by the domestic markets were strong in the fourth quarter. However, international markets or maybe some of the fixed income investments weren't quite not strong. But I hope that helps. It's really 2 different things: An average account value; and the average S&P go hand in hand, and that typically ties to the fee-based. Whereas the expenses associated with the acquisition are more of a point-to-point. Now if you look at the deferred acquisition cost to this quarter, they were right in line with what our expectations will be for every one of our businesses. Hope that helps."

If you talk about variable investment income, there's a lot of components that go into that. What I would talk about in terms of variable investment income is probably prepayment activity that occurs on our mortgages and fixed income investment as well as some real estate sales that we have that also impact that. Typically, I'd look at that on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We benefit from this variable investment income activity by $0.03 to $0.07 a quarter. In 2014, it was well above average, because as you're well aware, it was anticipating higher interest rates. So prepayment activity was really, really high. When we tried to call out, we tried to call out the variable investment income and it distorts the run rate that is actually in any particular quarter. Now if you look at this particular quarter, this particular quarter, the expectations were right in line with what we would have expected. We saw probably a benefit of variable investment income around $0.04, well over $0.04. So it's right in line with our expectations. So there was no reason to call it out. Now a year ago, a year ago, it was slightly higher. And actually, if you look out on a run-rate basis, on a run-rate basis, if you called out probably close to $0.08 -- $0.05 -- probably $0.06 to $0.08 a year ago, which was well above our expectations for the year, but hopefully that helps, but I would expect it to be right in line with expectations this quarter."

And at the moment, we're seeing the problems in credit really associated with the energy companies, the miners, and to an extent, companies with very large leverage businesses in emerging markets. So it's quite a tight little part of the credit markets. The way that, that would become contingent will be [indiscernible] of being foolish enough to get overcommitted in those markets. If that happens, you're going to see a broader credit contagion, and indeed a lower flow of credit in even the U.S. economy. Your question really was what probability do I see attached to that. We've discussed this in some length within our organization. We have people with a lot of different skills on this. But if I can distill it, I would say, in the next 12 months, there's probably a 20% probability. It's still a negative tail risk. It is most likely that the U.S. and global economy continue growing albeit at a slower pace than it was before. But we need to be very ready to defend if contingent happens and you end up with a worse economy. In particular on Brazil, I think what's gone wrong in Brazil apart from the obvious political process and commodity prices is, like China, they kept growth growing for quite a long time by expansion of credit, particularly on the Enterprises for infrastructure investment and so on. That expansion of credit has probably got to about the limit. So you're into a bit of a debt deflation situation. The IMS, I think, it was just brought down their growth estimate of their recession estimates this year to in excess of 3% from 1%. I think that's quite possible. I think you're going to see another year of pretty severe recession in Brazil come what may. But this is part of a deleveraging process. And we've seen this with economies with slower lot because people are not spending with quite a lot of cash available, and Principal International is taking maximum advantage of that right now. This will pass, it's a phase. It could take a while, but it's one where our business can do frankly okay."

So again, total recurring deposits were up 7% year-over-year, that's the billion number that I think Dan mentioned in the script ahead of time. What you may be focused on is the quarter-over-quarter, which was up only about 3.2 %, there's some noise there. We have some DB plan deposit noise there. If we strip that noise away and we don't expect that to recur and we look at those deferrals, so look at the core deferrals and match, that's actually up really strong quarter-over-quarter, closer to 11%, little bit north of 11%. So both with regard to quarter-over-quarter and trailing 12 months, we're seeing very strong growth in those recurring deposits. We're also seeing very strong growth with regard to the number of participants that are deferring. That percentage is up over 8%. So when you look at the fundamentals of this business, whether you're looking at plan count, again we saw that increase across all of the segments, whether you're looking at start-up plans in the industry, we're now seeing start-up plans 17% above pre-crisis level. So it's a huge opportunity in that part of the market that is completely underserved because 50% or so of those smaller employers do not, today, have work side access to retirement. We plan in that space extremely well and one of the leaders in that start-up plan market. So the underlying fundamentals here are really, really strong. When you look at the fourth quarter lapses, handful of large cases. Again, we're going to win and lose on an M&A basis. We happened to lose a couple where the acquirer of the plan went to the acquirer. The good news there is the momentum we're seeing. I might add one other thing in Q4 that we saw is one plan that came in as a sale in a very large plan, north of $500 million, is not going to fund until 1Q. So once in a while, as we've mentioned before, we're going to get those timing issues. But if you strip out those timing issues, when you look into Q1, we're seeing very significant momentum there, both with regard to our sales pipeline, good momentum in the pipeline, and we're also seeing good momentum with regard to retention. So as we look into 2016, certainly, we don't want to get into the prediction business, but we would anticipate a pretty strong positive net cash flow in Q1, and we would look at, as Terry said, to be back in that range of 1% to 3% beginning of year account values with regard to net cash flow full year."

A lot of company-wide initiatives to go right at that specific point. So again, net landed to RIS, but question, so I'll ask Nora to maybe fill in some of the blanks in your question. Nora?"

This is not going to surprise you but one of our priorities to make sure that we actually do continue to invest for a long term growth.

But we've got an equal focus on making sure that we're investing for that long term growth. So what you're going to see is, and we've given guidance on margin, and that guidance on margin gives us the ability to what we believe strike the right balance between those 2 things. Because the last thing we want to do is shrink to greatness. We've got a very sharp focus on a lot of -- when you think about digital, when you think about self-serve, when you think about the opportunities in the small to medium business market, that's our sweet spot.

We know it's top of mind for investors, and we fully appreciate that. I guess, why I start on this question is, we've been very active with the trade, we're active with DOL and Congress and better understanding the implications of that as it relates to the fiduciary definition. But from our perspective, Job 1 is to protect the interest of the American savers without taking away very valuable education and guidance, which, frankly, most workers are very dependent on. So we've looked at it at basically 3 different inflection points. One is that initial selection of the investments. We think that we've got that appropriately identified and the steps that we'll have to take in order to work with advisors. And so again, we think that's very manageable. The second is the routine inquiries that we have among our plan participants. They're inquiring about our hardship loan or a standard loan or trying to get some investor education and understand perhaps better the target date investment options. Again, we think that within the definition, there's a way to work with that. We think there's viable solutions. The third is around those job changers, and job changers are retirees. Again, we all know they have 3 options. One is to leave it in a plan. Our reading of the understanding of the world today would cause perhaps more people to leave it in the plan. There are some benefits from that to the participant. Perhaps fewer investment options, but at the same time, they may very well find that the expenses are lower because it's been aggregated with a large pool of dollars. The second is the rollover IRA, either with Principal or another third-party. And then lastly, as a cash out, which we think is a bad idea for all the obvious reasons. Again, we've come back to napping with that scenario looks like as people are faced with those decisions, and we think there are going to be necessary disclosure and additional steps that will have to be taken. But we've got that fairly well triangulated in terms of the impact. So we know there's more guidance, there's more education, there's more disclosure. We have a large team of people that are hammering on this issue. We don't think it's a material change to our run rate related to expenses. And like you, we're very anxious about the next 60 to 90 days to see what OMB produces and back to the DOL and what that might start looking like. And I kept that at a fairly high strategic level, both that as a backdrop, I'll turn it over to Nora to see if she's got any additional color."

We actually have a very large group, a team that's been working on this for a number of months doing scenario planning and engaging with our third-party distribution partners. And the one results of those discussion is it's pretty clear to us, and again, we're speculating on a preliminary reg here. But it's pretty clear to us that there is going to be an array of advisory business models coming out of this change, if and when those reg becomes final. Because we plan a RIS that's new reg, what you see is a huge amount of optionality. Many exceptions, many exemptions. And so various firms and various advisors and various broker-dealers are going to take different routes from our perspective. Whether they go to fiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, or the nonfiduciary with a third-party advisory service, whether they use the best interest contract, there's a lot of optionality. What we're doing is working with them and making sure that we're putting the systems in place to be able to service those diverse operating models across our various channels, firms and advisors.

I'll turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
I'd characterize 2015 as a good year. We delivered after-tax operating earnings of nearly $1.3 billion despite challenging conditions such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and underperformance of the U.S. equity markets, and we returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the benefit of our broad diversification by business, by geography, by investment platform and by asset class. In 2015, Principal continue to build momentum through outstanding investment performance and expansion of distribution and our solutions-based products set. Full year 2015 total company net cash flows of $23 billion were 4% of beginning-of-year assets under management. As we continue to attract retain retail, retirement and institutional investors, this helped drive assets under management to $527 billion at year-end despite a $28 billion drag from foreign exchange. 
Another major growth highlight for 2015, at point two, [ph] Principal International's 29th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows with $9 billion of flows for the year, plus another $21 billion of positive flows from our joint venture with China Construction Bank. On a constant currency basis, Principal International grew reported assets under management by 20% in 2015; double-digit earnings growth for Principal Global Investors and nearly $16 billion in positive net cash flows; record earnings for Specialty Benefits on record sales and a 9% growth in premium in fees; continued traction delivering mutual funds, separately managed accounts and annuity-based income solutions; strong underlying growth in plans, participants and reoccurring deposits for our U.S. retirement businesses and strong Individual Life full year results as claims return to expected levels. As I said, outstanding investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future growth. For example, 44 of our rated mutual funds or 76% have a 4- or 5-star Morningstar rating. Additionally, as Slide 5 shows, 88%, 89% and 93% of our investment options were in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. And 100% of our target date funds remain in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods at year-end, driving sales and retention in this key asset class and enabling us to help more individuals achieve financial success. 
From this strong competitive position, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in 2016 and beyond. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to execute on our strategy and further position ourselves for long-term growth. The U.S. remains the largest retirement market in the world, and Principal has maintained its leadership position for decades through exceptional service, product innovation and strong multichannel distribution. With the retail mutual funds business now reporting through Principal Global Investors, Full Service Accumulation is now the majority of Retirement and Income Solutions Fee or RIS-Fee. To be clear, the underlying fundamentals of this business remains strong. We continue to grow plan count across plan sizes, adding nearly 1,300 net new plans in 2015. And we continue to be a leader in start-up plans as we focus on expanding employee coverage. The Principal's core target market of small and medium-sized businesses is underserved, creating an ongoing opportunity for us to uniquely serve this market through our network of local offices and drive consistent growth in this segment. 
Full year reoccurring deposits grew $1.1 billion, up 7% versus 2014. These growth trends highlight the power of the payroll deduction component of this business, but more importantly, the work we're doing to advocate best-practice plan design with employers and advisers to increase participation and savings rates to better prepare their employees for retirement. Strong alliance for relationships continue to be a key driver of sales for Retirement and Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors as well as U.S. Insurance Solutions. In 2015, 7 different advisory firms sold more than $1 billion across our offerings, with those firms averaging more than 6 products per platform. In 2015, we continue to do business with more advisers and get our investments added to recommended list, platforms and model portfolios. In 2015, we had good traction of plan sponsors adopting our retirement rating as plan design. The primary features of these plans are automatic enrollment and automatic savings rate increases. Additionally, we launched an innovative income option in the fourth quarter, which offers an in-plan guaranteed annuity to provide more income security for plan participants. While this business remains under pressure from volatile markets, we expect good growth in sales and flows in 2016, giving meaningful growth in the pipeline. 
Two other points I'd like to emphasize. Our U.S. retirement business continues to be one of the highest performing businesses in the industry and continues to create tremendous value for the enterprise overall. Slide 6 provides an update on fiduciary regulations. With the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations advancing to the Office of Management and Budget last week, final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. The Principal remains fully engaged to help ensure the final regulations work in favor of individuals trying to save for retirement, we also remain focused on scenario planning and potential changes to business models with a particular focus on education and guidance, compliance and oversight, provision of investment information, distribution and asset retention. Absent clarity around the final rule, we're not providing a cost estimate at this time. But based on what we know today, we do not expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. The Principal has a long history of successfully adapting to complex regulations, our track record reflects the benefits of scale, products and service breadth and top-tier investments, all critical to meeting the needs of the market and diverse adviser business models. As with prior regulatory developments, we're well positioned and confident we'll emerge among the winners. 
Despite volatility in emerging markets, Principal International continues to demonstrate that we are in the right target markets with marquee distribution partners. As an example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides our joint venture, Brasilprev, access to more than 61 million customers. Customers' confidence in Banco do Brasil and our tax-advantaged individual retirement products helped drive Brasilprev's full year net cash flow to $7 billion. This growth further strengthened Brasilprev's position as the #1 private retirement provider in Brazil in terms of net cash flow and assets. 
Additionally, we continue to gain traction in the voluntary savings market. For example, on a constant currency basis with Chile, volunteer assets under management increased 17% and voluntary fee income increased 25% in 2015. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of our international operations. 
Principal Global Investors, which now include retail and institutional asset management, ended 2015 with $361 billion in assets under management. Institutional sales were strong in 2015, and the pipeline is robust. To counter the broader shift in demand to more passive or low-cost investment options, Principal Global Investors launched solutions in areas where demand for active strategies remain strong, including multiple new real estate offerings and fixed income strategies. We'll continue to add to our ETF suite in 2016 and beyond as well as our portfolio of income solutions, which will include both funds and guaranteed income options. 
In December, The Principal earned the top spot in the category in Pension & Investments' annual survey of Best Places to Work in Money Management for the fourth consecutive year. This award highlights The Principal's strong investment management culture and teams that successfully work to meet client's needs every day and position us to attract and retain top investment talent. 
Moving now to our insurance businesses. Our focus on small and medium-sized business markets remain a key differentiator, and we continue to find ways to improve the customer experience. In 2015, we piloted our easy-elect group benefits enrollment tool in 7 markets with meaningful improvement in voluntary participation as we continue to help individuals understand the importance of protection to broader financial security. 
In closing, I'm optimistic about 2016 and our long-term future despite the continued global macroeconomic volatility. Strong business fundamentals and our ability to focus on things we can control will continue to drive momentum and generate long-term profitable growth. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a solid end",1301,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
The fourth quarter was a solid end to a good year. On a reported basis, total company after-tax operating earnings were $303 million, a 6% decrease from the prior year period, reflecting macroeconomic volatility. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share were $1.02 compared to a normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.07, down 5%. However, on a constant currency basis, earnings per share increased 1% quarter-over-quarter. For full year 2015, reported total company after-tax earnings were nearly $1.3 billion, a 4% decrease from a record 2014. The lower reported earnings in 2015 were primarily driven by lower variable investment income and the impact from currency translation. Year-end 2015 return on equity, excluding AOCI other than the foreign currency translation adjustment, was 14.2%. The daily average change in equity markets is an important driver of the revenue for our fee businesses. In fourth quarter 2015, despite a 6.5% point-to-point increase in the S&P 500, the daily average change for the quarter was slightly higher than 1% compared to third quarter 2015. On a full year basis, S&P 500 daily average increased approximately 7% in 2015 compared to a 17.5% increase in 2014. 
As we look ahead to 2016, if the macroeconomic volatility continues as it has in January, we anticipate a slowdown in revenues in our fee-based businesses. Therefore, we'll focus on things we can control and continue to manage expenses to ensure revenue and expense are aligned. With that said, we will continue to make the necessary investments to keep our competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and our teams remain focused on execution regardless of the macroeconomic environment. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results starting on Slide 8 with RIS-Fee businesses. Fourth quarter pretax operating earnings of $125 million were down 10% from the year ago quarter. Net revenue decreased 2% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to flat average account values and a decline in variable investment income. Full year 2015 net revenue increased 1% over 2014. Net investment income decreased due to lower variable investment income in 2015 compared to the higher-than-expected levels in 2014. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 31%. After normalizing for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, it was 34%. RIS-Fee had net outflows of $1.6 billion in fourth quarter 2015 despite strong sales of $3.1 billion. Fourth quarter net cash flows reflect exit of a few large cases due to M&A activity and continued pricing discipline as well as the timing of funding for new sales. As a result, we anticipate strong net cash flows in first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 net cash flows to be 1% to 3% of beginning-of-period account values as we maintain our focus on balancing growth and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $62 million, a 4% increase over the year ago quarter, primarily due to growth in account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 56%. The pension closeout business had record full year sales of $1.8 billion, which are double 2014 sales. The pipeline remains strong and opportunities in 2016 look promising. 
Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors fourth quarter pretax operating earnings were $102 million, a 2% increase over the prior year quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion, and pretax operating earnings grew 11% compared to the prior year period. Pretax return on adjusted revenue increased to 34%. Despite the industry's bias towards passive investment strategies, Principal Global Investors generated full year net cash flows of nearly $16 billion with $8 billion coming from institutional clients. This is a result of outstanding investment performance and outcome-oriented solutions that are in demand. Additionally, full year management fees increased 9% over 2014, above the 6% growth in average assets under management, demonstrating client preference for higher fee capabilities that, combined with increased scale, led to margin improvements. 
Slide 11 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $67 million. On a constant currency basis, Principal International continues to drive mid-teens earnings growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International's pretax return on net revenue was 38% after normalizing for the third quarter 2015 impairment of intangible assets in Claritas. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $57 million, a 29% increase over the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter premium and fees grew 8% compared to the prior year quarter, and the overall loss ratio remained favorable at 62%. These are very strong results even in a seasonally high fourth quarter due to our focus on the small and medium-sized business market and disciplined profitable growth. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Despite claims experience that was in line with expectation, this is at the low end of our expected range for the quarter, partially due to lower variable revenue. However, full year pretax operating earnings growth was strong year-over-year. For the quarter, total company net income was $254 million, which includes realized capital losses of $48 million. After-tax net credit-related losses of $5 million were slightly better than expected. The losses related to the hedging activities were predominantly due to interest rate and equity market changes. Full year credit-related losses were $20 million, a 65% improvement over 2014 results. Unrealized gains were $1.9 billion, and the portfolio ended the year with a net gain of $1.1 billion. Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. In addition, we have always had a disciplined approach to asset/liability management, and therefore, we are not forced sellers during stressed times. At year-end 2015, our energy portfolio carrying value was 95% of par value. Our overall exposure to the energy sector represents 5.7% of our total fixed maturity portfolio and 4.2% of our total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2015. Our market value exposure in high-yield energy companies as of year-end 2015 was $280 million or less than 1/2 of 1% of total U.S. invested assets. 
Despite the continued market volatility in the beginning of 2016, we remain confident about the strength of our investment portfolio. As outlined on Slide 14, our capital management the strategy remains balanced and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Our fee-based businesses drove nearly 70% of 2015 normalized range, which generates higher levels of deployable capital and provides greater financial flexibility.  In 2015, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, which represented nearly 90% of net income. Our balanced capital deployments include $441 million in common stock dividends, $355 million in strategic acquisitions, and $275 million in share repurchases. The full year common stock dividend was $1.50 per share. This is a 17% increase over full year 2014 as we continue to increase our payout ratio. Additionally, last night, we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in first quarter 2016. 
While we continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities, the current equity market volatility is also providing an opportunity to enhance shareholder value through execution of the remainder of our share buyback authorization. In 2016, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders. In closing, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth. This concludes our prepared remarks.

As we've talked about this before, we always looked at a balanced approach to our capital deployment strategy to enhance long-term shareholder value. As we've stated before, we have more fee-based businesses predominantly. Pretty close to 70% of our earnings are coming from fee-based businesses, which is less capital intensive. As a result of that, we have an opportunity to deploy more capital. And if you look at what we talked about historically, only about 35% of our capital needs are in an organic basis, leaving close to 65% available for other deployment opportunities. That said, we think that we need to have a balanced approach. We have -- are on track to increase our dividend as a percent of that total net income percentage closer to 40% over the longer period here. But as you look at share buybacks and you look at M&A opportunities, the M&A opportunities is still very important to us. We want to have an active pipeline, we want to continue to look at that. But as you say, with the valuations as low as they currently are, it makes sense for us to actually deploy capital in terms of buying back our shares because we do believe that they're undervalued at this point in time. It's a very volatile market so we have to have that disciplined approach. But again, we're going to continue to look at capital deployment strategies, and we said $800 million to $1 billion this year. We expect to be having a very balanced approach as we've done in the past. But as you said, the opportunities right now are very enticing for the buyback program. And we actually have $75 million of our authorization that's outstanding at this point in time."

The first is that the decline in net flows in the second half of the year was really around some of the large cap equity strategies, particularly at Columbus Circle and Principal Global Equities, where clients have been looking at the possible alternative and going for lower-fee capabilities. Now as you saw from our flows though, we more than replaced that with the higher added-value strategies that we would be specialized in, which range through high-yield real estate, small cap, areas that are less-efficient markets. But net-net, it was a slightly down but still positive fourth quarter. And I'd emphasize that because many of our peer group are seeing negative flows. One area where the peer group is seeing negative flows is sovereigns, particularly at central banks and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, which are obviously under severe financial pressure. We have some business in those areas, and we have not seen those outflows yet because we are seeing much stronger investment performance and we've tended to be among the managers that got retained. We're hopeful that will continue, but obviously there are no guarantees. If I look at the pipeline, which I think was partly where you were going, we have had a very active last 2 months, including over the holidays and in January. And that is unusual. Usually the institutional market globally, clients in that period and in beginning of the year, but we've seen quote activity and, indeed, fundings looking really quite positive. And I have to say we're feeling pretty optimistic about the flow potential, and that's related to the investment performance that Dan and Terry both mentioned."

As you look at the impact on the fees that occur, it's really more the daily average as -- and we use that as a proxy for what the movements in the impact to our account value. So you really look at the average account value from one period to the next period. Now actual performance of those assets also come into play versus the proxy that we use. Last quarter, we talked about a significant drop point-to-point in the S&P 500. That was down 6.7% third quarter over third quarter. That has an impact on the deferred acquisition costs, and that's what we were referencing the last quarter. Now we have an expectation that you'll have anywhere from a 2% to 3% positive impact in that point-to-point time. So if you look at that 2% to 3% versus, say, down nearly 7%, you're talking a 9% to 10% drop that impacts the deferred acquisition model. Now you go forward to this quarter, now the point-to-point was up 6.5% as you pointed out. Now that has an impact on the expenses, but the differential between what the expectation and what the actual point-to-point was, was much smaller this quarter and didn't have as significant of an impact. Again, that S&P 500 is a proxy for the movement in our actual assets. The actual asset movement was also impacted by the domestic markets were strong in the fourth quarter. However, international markets and maybe some of the fixed income investments weren't quite as strong. But I hope that helps. It's really 2 different things: an average account value and the average S&P go hand in hand, and that typically ties to the fee-based whereas the expenses associated with the acquisition are more of a point-to-point. Now if you look at the deferred acquisition cost for this quarter, they were right in line with what our expectations would be for every one of our businesses. Hope that helps."

As you talk about variable investment income, there's a lot of components that go into that. What I would talk about in terms of variable investment income is probably prepayment activity that occurs on our mortgages as fixed income investment as well as some real estate sales that we have that also impact that. And typically, I'd look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We benefit from this variable investment income activity by $0.03 to $0.07 a quarter. In 2014, it was well above average because, as you're well aware, everybody was anticipating higher interest rates and so prepayment activity was really, really high. But we try to call out the variable investment income when it distorts the run rate that is actually in any particular quarter. Now if you look at this particular quarter, this particular quarter, the expectations were right in line with what we would have expected. We saw probably a benefit of variable investment income around $0.04, a little over $0.04. So it's right in line with our expectations. So there was no reason to call it out. Now a year ago, it was slightly higher. And if you actually look out on a run rate basis, we called out probably close to $0.08 -- probably $0.06 to $0.08 a year ago, which was well above our expectations for the year. But hopefully that helps, but I would expect it to be right in line with expectations this quarter."

And at the moment, we're seeing the problems in credit really associated with the energy companies, the miners, and to an extent, companies with very large leverage businesses in emerging markets. So it's quite a tight little part of the credit market. The way that, that would become contagion would be if banks have been foolish enough to get overcommitted in those markets. If that happens, you're going to see a broader credit contagion and, indeed, a lower flow of credit in even the U.S. economy. Your question really was what probability do I see attached to that. We've discussed this at some length within our organization. We have people with a lot of different skills on this. But if I can distill it, I would say, in the next 12 months, that's probably a 20% probability. It's still a negative tail risk. It is most likely that the U.S. and global economy continue growing albeit at a slower pace than it was before. But we need to be ready to defend if contagion happens and you end up with a worse economy. In particular on Brazil, I think what's gone wrong in Brazil apart from the obvious political process and commodity prices is, like China, they kept growth going for quite a long time by expansion of credit, particularly to state-owned enterprises for infrastructure investment and so on. That expansion of credit has probably got to about the limit. So you're into a bit of a debt deflation situation. The IMS, I think it was, just brought down their growth estimate or their recession estimate this year to in excess of 3% from 1%. I think that's quite possible. I think you're going to see another year of pretty severe recession in Brazil come what may. But this is part of a deleveraging process. And we've seen this with economies that slow a lot. Because people are not spending, there's quite a lot of cash available. And Principal International is taking maximum advantage of that right now. This will pass, it's a phase. It could take a while, but it's one where our business can do frankly okay."

Total -- so again, total recurring deposits were up 7% year-over-year, that's the billion number that I think Dan mentioned in the script ahead of time. What you may be focused on is the quarter-over-quarter, which was up only about 3.2 %. There's some noise there. We have some DB plan deposit noise there. If we strip that noise away and we don't expect that to recur and we look at those core deferrals, so look at the core deferrals and match, that's actually up really strong quarter-over-quarter, closer to 11%, little bit north of 11%. So both with regard to quarter-over-quarter and trailing 12 months, we're seeing very strong growth in those recurring deposits. We're also seeing very strong growth with regard to the number of participants that are deferring. That percentage is up over 8%. So when you look at the fundamentals of this business, whether you're looking at plan count, again we saw that increase across all of the segments, whether you're looking at start-up plans in the industry, we're now seeing start-up plans 17% above pre-crisis level. So a huge opportunity in that part of the market that is completely underserved because 50% or so of those smaller employers do not, today, have work side access to retirement. We play in that space extremely well and one of the leaders in that start-up plan market. So the underlying fundamentals here are really, really strong. When you look at the fourth quarter lapses, handful of large cases. Again, we're going to win and lose on an M&A basis. We happen to lose a couple where the acquirer of the plan went to the acquirer. The good news there is the momentum we're seeing. I might add one other thing in Q4 that we saw is one plan that came in as a sale, and a very large plan, north of $500 million, is not going to fund until 1Q. So once in a while, as we've mentioned before, we're going to get those timing issues. But if you strip out those timing issues and you look into Q1, we're seeing very significant momentum there, both with regard to our sales pipeline, good momentum in the pipeline, and we're also seeing good momentum with regard to retention. So as we look into 2016, certainly, we don't want to get into the prediction business, but we would anticipate a pretty strong positive net cash flow in Q1, and we would look, as Terry said, to be back in that range of 1% to 3% beginning-of-year account values with regard to net cash flow full year."

We know it's top of mind for investors, and we fully appreciate that. I guess, where I start on this question is we've been very active with the trades, we're active with DOL and Congress in better understanding the implications it has as it relates to this fiduciary definition. But from our perspective, job 1 is to protect the interest of the American savers without taking away very valuable education and guidance, which, frankly, most workers are very dependent on. So we've looked at it at basically 3 different inflection points. One is that initial selection of the investments. We think that we've got that appropriately identified and the steps that we'll have to take in order to work with advisers. And so again, we think that that's very manageable. The second is the routine inquiries that we have among our plan participants. They're inquiring about a hardship loan or a standard loan or trying to get some investor education and understand perhaps better the target date investment options. Again, we think that within the definition, there's a way to work with that. We think there's viable solutions. The third is around those job changers, and job changers and retirees. Again, we all know they have 3 options. One is to leave it in the plan. Our reading of the understanding of the rule today would cause perhaps more people to leave it in the plan. There are some benefits from that to the participant. Perhaps fewer investment options, but at the same time, they may very well find that the expenses are lower because it's been aggregated with a large pool of dollars. The second is the rollover IRA, either with Principal or another third-party. And then lastly is the cash out, which we think is a bad idea for all the obvious reasons. Again, we'd come back to mapping what that scenario looks like as people are faced with those decisions, and we think there are going to be necessary disclosure and additional steps that will have to be taken. But we've got that fairly well triangulated in terms of the impact. So we know there's more guidance, there's more education, there's more disclosure. We have a large team of people that are hammering away on this issue. We don't think it's a material change to our run rate related to expenses.

We go across all the channels, all the firms. So we're out there. We actually have a very large group, a team that's been working on this for a number of months doing scenario planning and engaging with our third-party distribution partners. And the one result of those discussions is it's pretty clear to us, and again, we're speculating on a preliminary reg here, but it's pretty clear to us that there's going to be an array of adviser business models coming out of this change if and when this reg becomes final. Because between a RIS and this new reg, what you see is a huge amount of optionality. Many exceptions, many exemptions. And so various firms and various advisers and various broker-dealers are going to take different routes from our perspective. Whether they go the fiduciary route with a third-party advisory service or the nonfiduciary with a third-party advisory service, whether they use the best interest contract, there's a lot of optionality. What we're doing is working with them and making sure that we're putting the systems in place to be able to service those diverse operating models across our various channels, firms and advisers. And we feel pretty optimistic that at the end of the day, somebody like us who's got the scale and the expertise and the discipline to really work channel by channel, firm by firm is going to have a really elegant solution to a unbelievably complex set of regulations."

One is we've got tremendous investment performance in that target date suite, and we've got a huge lineup with regard to target date, whether you want primarily passive, whether you want primarily active, whether you want it in a funds form or in a CIT form. So between the choice in the investment performance, we are highly competitive in that space.

I'll turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
I'd characterize 2015 as a good year. We delivered after-tax operating earnings of nearly $1.3 billion despite challenging conditions such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and underperformance of the U.S. equity markets, and we returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the benefit of our broad diversification by business, by geography, by investment platform and by asset class. In 2015, Principal continued to build momentum through outstanding investment performance and expansion of distribution and our solutions-based product set. Full year 2015 total company net cash flows of $23 billion were 4% of beginning-of-year assets under management, as we continued to attract and retain retail, retirement and institutional investors. This helped drive assets under management to $527 billion at year-end despite a $28 billion drag from foreign exchange. 
And other major growth highlights for 2015. At point two, [ph] Principal International's 29th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows with $9 billion of flows for the year, plus another $21 billion of positive flows from our joint venture with China Construction Bank. On a constant currency basis, Principal International grew reported assets under management by 20% in 2015; double-digit earnings growth for Principal Global Investors and nearly $16 billion in positive net cash flows; record earnings for Specialty Benefits on record sales and a 9% growth in premium and fees; continued traction delivering mutual funds, separately managed accounts and annuity-based income solutions; strong underlying growth in plans, participants and reoccurring deposits for our U.S. retirement businesses; and strong Individual Life full year results as claims returned to expected levels. As I said, outstanding investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future growth. For example, 44 of our rated mutual funds or 76% have a 4- or 5-star Morningstar rating. Additionally, as Slide 5 shows, 88%, 89% and 93% of our investment options were in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. And 100% of our target-date funds remained in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods at year-end, driving sales and retention in this key asset class and enabling us to help more individuals achieve financial success. 
From this strong competitive position, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in 2016 and beyond. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to execute on our strategy and further position ourselves for long-term growth. The U.S. remains the largest retirement market in the world, and Principal has maintained its leadership position for decades through exceptional service, product innovation and strong multichannel distribution. With the retail mutual funds business now reporting through Principal Global Investors, Full Service Accumulation is now the majority of Retirement and Income Solutions Fee or RIS-Fee. To be clear, the underlying fundamentals of this business remain strong. We continue to grow plan count across plan sizes, adding nearly 1,300 net new plans in 2015. And we continue to be a leader in start-up plans as we focus on expanding employee coverage. The Principal's core target market of small and medium-sized businesses is underserved, creating an ongoing opportunity for us to uniquely serve this market through our network of local offices and drive consistent growth in this segment. 
Full year reoccurring deposits grew $1.1 billion, up 7% versus 2014. These growth trends highlight the power of the payroll-deduction component of this business, but more importantly, the work we're doing to advocate best-practice plan design with employers and advisers to increase participation and savings rates to better prepare their employees for retirement. Strong alliance for relationships continue to be a key driver of sales for Retirement and Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors as well as U.S. Insurance Solutions. In 2015, 7 different advisory firms sold more than $1 billion across our offerings, with those firms averaging more than 6 products per platform. In 2015, we continue to do business with more advisers and get our investments added to recommended lists, platforms and model portfolios. In 2015, we had good traction of plan sponsors adopting our retirement rating as [ph] plan design. The primary features of these plans are automatic enrollment and automatic savings rate increases. Additionally, we launched an innovative income option in the fourth quarter, which offers an in-plan guaranteed annuity to provide more income security for plan participants. While this business remains under pressure from volatile markets, we expect good growth in sales and flows in 2016, giving meaningful growth in the pipeline. 
Two other points I'd like to emphasize. Our U.S. retirement business continues to be one of the highest-performing businesses in the industry and continues to create tremendous value for the enterprise overall. Slide 6 provides an update on fiduciary regulations. With the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations advancing to the Office of Management and Budget last week, final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. The Principal remains fully engaged to help ensure the final regulations work in favor of individuals trying to save for retirement. We also remain focused on scenario planning and potential changes to business models, with a particular focus on education and guidance, compliance and oversight, provision of investment information, distribution and asset retention. Absent clarity around the final rule, we're not providing a cost estimate at this time. But based on what we know today, we do not expect a significant increase in our run-rate expenses. The Principal has a long history of successfully adapting to complex regulations. Our track record reflects the benefits of scale, products and service breadth and top-tier investments, all critical to meeting the needs of the market and diverse adviser business models. As with prior regulatory developments, we're well positioned and confident we'll emerge among the winners. 
Despite volatility in emerging markets, Principal International continues to demonstrate that we are in the right target markets with marquee distribution partners. As an example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides our joint venture, Brasilprev, access to more than 61 million customers. Customers' confidence in Banco do Brasil and our tax-advantaged individual retirement products helped drive Brasilprev's full year net cash flows to $7 billion. This growth further strengthened Brasilprev's position as the #1 private retirement provider in Brazil in terms of net cash flow and assets. 
Additionally, we continue to gain traction in the voluntary savings market. For example, on a constant currency basis with Chile, volunteer assets under management increased 17% and voluntary fee income increased 25% in 2015. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of our international operations. 
Principal Global Investors, which now include retail and institutional asset management, ended 2015 with $361 billion in assets under management. Institutional sales were strong in 2015, and the pipeline is robust. To counter the broader shift in demand to more passive or low-cost investment options, Principal Global Investors launched solutions in areas where demand for active strategies remain strong, including multiple new real estate offerings and fixed income strategies. We'll continue to add to our ETF suite in 2016 and beyond as well as our portfolio of income solutions, which will include both funds and guaranteed income options. 
In December, The Principal earned the top spot in the category in Pension & Investments' annual survey of Best Places to Work in Money Management for the fourth consecutive year. This award highlights The Principal's strong investment management culture and teams that successfully work to meet client's needs every day, and position us to attract and retain top investment talent. 
Moving now to our insurance businesses. Our focus on small and medium-sized business markets remain a key differentiator, and we continue to find ways to improve the customer experience. In 2015, we piloted our easy-elect group benefits enrollment tool in 7 markets, with meaningful improvement in voluntary participation, as we continue to help individuals understand the importance of protection to broader financial security. 
In closing, I'm optimistic about 2016 and our long-term future, despite the continued global macroeconomic volatility. Strong business fundamentals and our ability to focus on things we can control will continue to drive momentum and generate long-term profitable growth. Terry?"
201105,313906443,924880,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a solid end",1293,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
The fourth quarter was a solid end to a good year. On a reported basis, total company after-tax operating earnings were $303 million, a 6% decrease from the prior-year period, reflecting macroeconomic volatility. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share were $1.02 compared to a normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.07, down 5%. However, on a constant currency basis, earnings per share increased 1% quarter-over-quarter. For full year 2015, reported total company after-tax earnings were nearly $1.3 billion, a 4% decrease from a record 2014. The lower reported earnings in 2015 were primarily driven by lower variable investment income and the impact from currency translation. Year-end 2015 return on equity, excluding AOCI other than the foreign currency translation adjustment, was 14.2%. The daily average change in equity markets is an important driver of the revenue for our fee businesses. In fourth quarter 2015, despite a 6.5% point-to-point increase in the S&P 500, the daily average change for the quarter was slightly higher than 1% compared to third quarter 2015. On a full year basis, S&P 500 daily average increased approximately 7% in 2015 compared to a 17.5% increase in 2014. 
As we look ahead to 2016, if the macroeconomic volatility continues as it has in January, we anticipate a slowdown in revenues in our fee-based businesses. Therefore, we'll focus on things we can control and continue to manage expenses to ensure revenue and expense are aligned. With that said, we will continue to make the necessary investments to keep our competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and our teams remain focused on execution regardless of the macroeconomic environment. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results, starting on Slide 8 with RIS-Fee businesses. Fourth quarter pretax operating earnings of $125 million were down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue decreased 2% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to flat average account values and a decline in variable investment income. Full year 2015 net revenue increased 1% over 2014. Net investment income decreased due to lower variable investment income in 2015 compared to the higher-than-expected levels in 2014. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 31%. After normalizing for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, it was 34%. RIS-Fee had net outflows of $1.6 billion in fourth quarter 2015, despite strong sales of $3.1 billion. Fourth quarter net cash flows reflect exit of a few large cases [ph] due to M&A activity and continued pricing discipline as well as the timing of funding for new sales. As a result, we anticipate strong net cash flows in first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 net cash flows to be 1% to 3% of beginning-of-period account values as we maintain our focus on balancing growth and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $62 million, a 4% increase over the year-ago quarter, primarily due to growth in account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 56%. The pension closeout business had record full year sales of $1.8 billion, which are double 2014 sales. The pipeline remains strong and opportunities in 2016 look promising. 
Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors fourth quarter pretax operating earnings were $102 million, a 2% increase over the prior-year quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion, and pretax operating earnings grew 11% compared to the prior-year period. Pretax return on adjusted revenue increased to 34%. Despite the industry's bias towards passive investment strategies, Principal Global Investors generated full year net cash flows of nearly $16 billion, with $8 billion coming from institutional clients. This is a result of outstanding investment performance and outcome-oriented solutions that are in demand. Additionally, full year management fees increased 9% over 2014, above the 6% growth in average assets under management, demonstrating client preference for higher fee capabilities that, combined with increased scale, led to margin improvement. 
Slide 11 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $67 million. On a constant currency basis, Principal International continues to drive mid-teens earnings growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International's pretax return on net revenue was 38% after normalizing for the third quarter 2015 impairment of intangible assets in Claritas. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $57 million, a 29% increase over the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter premium and fees grew 8% compared to the prior-year quarter, and the overall loss ratio remained favorable at 62%. These are very strong results, even in the seasonally high fourth quarter, due to our focus on the small and medium-sized business market and disciplined profitable growth. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Despite claims experience that was in line with expectation, this is at the low end of our expected range for the quarter, partially due to lower variable revenue. However, full year pretax operating earnings growth was strong year-over-year. For the quarter, total company net income was $254 million, which includes realized capital losses of $48 million. After-tax net credit-related losses of $5 million were slightly better than expected. The losses related to the hedging activities were predominantly due to interest rate and equity market changes. Full year credit-related losses were $20 million, a 65% improvement over 2014 results. Unrealized gains were $1.9 billion, and the portfolio ended the year with a net gain of $1.1 billion. Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. In addition, we have always had a disciplined approach to asset/liability management, and therefore, we are not forced sellers during stressed times. At year-end 2015, our energy portfolio carrying value was 95% of par value. Our overall exposure to the energy sector represents 5.7% of our total fixed maturity portfolio and 4.2% of our total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2015. Our market value exposure in high-yield energy companies as of year-end 2015 was $280 million or less than 1/2 of 1% of total U.S. invested assets. 
Despite the continued market volatility in the beginning of 2016, we remain confident about the strength of our investment portfolio. As outlined on Slide 14, our capital management strategy remains balanced and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Our fee-based businesses drove nearly 70% of 2015 normalized earnings, which generates higher levels of deployable capital and provides greater financial flexibility.  In 2015, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, which represented nearly 90% of net income. Our balanced capital deployments include $441 million in common stock dividends, $355 million in strategic acquisitions, and $275 million in share repurchases. The full year common stock dividend was $1.50 per share. This is a 17% increase over full year 2014 as we continue to increase our payout ratio. Additionally, last night, we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in first quarter 2016. 
While we continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities, the current equity market volatility is also providing an opportunity to enhance shareholder value through execution of the remainder of our share buyback authorization. In 2016, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders. In closing, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

As we've talked about this before, we always looked at a balanced approach to our capital deployment strategy to enhance long-term shareholder value. As we've stated before, we have more fee-based businesses, predominantly. Pretty close to 70% of our earnings are coming from fee-based businesses, which is less capital intensive. As a result of that, we have an opportunity to deploy more capital. And if you look at what we talked about historically, only about 35% of our capital is needed on an organic basis, leaving close to 65% available for other deployment opportunities. That said, we think that we need to have a balanced approach. We have -- are on track to increase our dividend as a percent of that total net income percentage, closer to 40% over the longer period here. But as you look at share buybacks and you look at M&A opportunities, the M&A opportunities are still very important to us. We want to have an active pipeline, we want to continue to look at that. But as you say, with the valuations as low as they currently are, it makes sense for us to actually deploy capital in terms of buying back our shares because we do believe that they're undervalued at this point in time. It's a very volatile market, so we have to have that disciplined approach. But again, we're going to continue to look at capital deployment strategies, and we said $800 million to $1 billion this year. We expect to be having a very balanced approach, as we've done in the past. But as you said, the opportunities right now are very enticing for the buyback program. And we actually have $75 million of our authorization that's outstanding at this point in time."

The first is that the decline in net flows in the second half of the year was really around some of the large-cap equity strategies, particularly at Columbus Circle and Principal Global Equities, where clients have been looking at the passive alternative and going for lower fee capabilities. Now as you saw from our flows though, we more than replaced that with the higher added-value strategies that we already specialize in, which range through high-yield real estate, small cap, areas that are less-efficient markets. But net-net, it was a slightly down but still positive fourth quarter. And I'd emphasize that because many of our peer group are seeing negative flows. One area where the peer group is seeing negative flows is sovereigns, particularly at central banks and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, which are obviously under severe financial pressure. We have some business in those areas, and we have not seen those outflows yet because we are seeing much stronger investment performance, and we've tended to be among the managers that got retained. We're hopeful that will continue, but obviously there are no guarantees. If I look at the pipeline, which I think was partly where you were going, we have had a very active last 2 months, including over the holidays and in January. And that is unusual. Usually the institutional market globally quiets down during that period, around the end and beginning of the year. But we've seen quote activity and, indeed, fundings looking really quite positive. And I have to say we're feeling pretty optimistic about the flow potential, and that's related to the investment performance that Dan and Terry both mentioned."

As you look at the impact on the fees that occur, it's really more the daily average asset [ph] -- and we use that as a proxy for what the movements in the impact to our account value. So you really look at the average account value from one period to the next period. Now actual performance of those assets also come into play versus the proxy that we use. Last quarter, we talked about a significant drop point-to-point in the S&P 500. That was down 6.7% third quarter over third quarter. That has an impact on the deferred acquisition costs, and that's what we were referencing the last quarter. Now we have an expectation that you'll have anywhere from a 2% to 3% positive impact in that point-to-point time. So if you look at that 2% to 3% versus, say, down nearly 7%, you're talking a 9% to 10% drop that impacts the deferred acquisition model. Now you go forward to this quarter, now the point-to-point was up 6.5%, as you pointed out. Now that has an impact on the expenses, but the differential between what the expectation and what the actual point-to-point was, was much smaller this quarter and didn't have as significant of an impact. Again, that S&P 500 is a proxy for the movement in our actual assets. The actual asset movement was also impacted by -- the domestic markets were strong in the fourth quarter. However, international markets and maybe some of the fixed income investments weren't quite as strong. But I hope that helps. It's really 2 different things: an average account value and the average S&P go hand in hand, and that typically ties to the fee-based, whereas the expenses associated with the acquisition are more of a point-to-point. Now if you look at the deferred acquisition cost for this quarter, they were right in line with what our expectations would be for every one of our businesses. Hope that helps."

What I would talk about in terms of variable investment income is probably prepayment activity that occurs on our mortgages and fixed income investments as well as some real estate sales that we have that also impact that. And typically, I'd look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We benefit from this variable investment income activity by $0.03 to $0.07 a quarter. In 2014, it was well above average because, as you're well aware, everybody was anticipating higher interest rates, and so prepayment activity was really, really high. But we try to call out the variable investment income when it distorts the run rate that is actually in any particular quarter. Now if you look at this particular quarter, this particular quarter, the expectations were right in line with what we would have expected. We saw probably a benefit of variable investment income around $0.04, a little over $0.04. So it's right in line with our expectations. So there was no reason to call it out. Now a year ago, it was slightly higher. And if you actually look out on a run rate basis, we called out probably close to $0.08 -- $0.05 to -- no, probably $0.06 to $0.08 a year ago, which was well above our expectations for the year.

Talking about Brazil, I mean, Brazil continues performing very well. We put a $6.9 billion in net customer cash flows. As Dan mentioned, our JV with Banco is going very well.

And at the moment, we're seeing the problems in credit really associated with the energy companies, the minors, and to an extent, companies with very large leveraged businesses in emerging markets. So it's quite a tight little part of the credit market. The way that, that would become contagion would be if banks have been foolish enough to get overcommitted in those markets. If that happens, you're going to see a broader credit contagion and, indeed, a lower flow of credit in even the U.S. economy. Your question really was what probability do I see attached to that. We've discussed this at some length within our organization. We have people with a lot of different skills on this. But if I can distill it, I would say, in the next 12 months, that's probably a 20% probability. It's still a negative tail risk. It is most likely that the U.S. and global economy continue growing, albeit at a slower pace than it was before. But we need to be ready to defend if contagion happens and you end up with a worse economy. In particular on Brazil, I think what's gone wrong in Brazil, apart from the obvious political process and commodity prices, is, like China, they kept growth going for quite a long time by expansion of credit, particularly to state-owned enterprises for infrastructure investment and so on. That expansion of credit has probably got to about the limit. So you're into a bit of a debt deflation situation. The IMF, I think it was, just brought down their growth estimate or their recession estimate this year to in excess of 3% from 1%. I think that's quite possible. I think you're going to see another year of pretty severe recession in Brazil, come what may. But this is part of a deleveraging process. And we've seen this with economies that slow a lot. Because people are not spending, there's quite a lot of cash available. And Principal International is taking maximum advantage of that right now. This will pass, it's a phase. It could take a while, but it's one where our business can do, frankly, okay."

Total -- so again, total recurring deposits were up 7% year-over-year, that's the billion number that I think Dan mentioned in the script ahead of time. What you may be focused on is the quarter-over-quarter, which was up only about 3.2%. There's some noise there. We have some DB plan deposit noise there. If we strip that noise away and we don't expect that to recur and we look at those core deferrals, so look at the core deferrals and match, that's actually up really strong quarter-over-quarter, closer to 11%, little bit north of 11%. So both with regard to quarter-over-quarter and trailing 12 months, we're seeing very strong growth in those recurring deposits. We're also seeing very strong growth with regard to the number of participants that are deferring. That percentage is up over 8%. So when you look at the fundamentals of this business, whether you're looking at plan count, again we saw that increase across all of the segments, whether you're looking at start-up plans in the industry, we're now seeing start-up plans 17% above pre-crisis level. So still a huge opportunity in that part of the market that is completely underserved because 50% or so of those smaller employers do not, today, have work site access to retirement. We play in that space extremely well and one of the leaders in that start-up plan market. So the underlying fundamentals here are really, really strong. When you look at the fourth quarter lapses, handful of large cases. Again, we're going to win and lose on an M&A basis. We happen to lose a couple where the acquirer of the plan went to the acquirer. The good news there is the momentum we're seeing. I might add one other thing in Q4 that we saw is one plan that came in as a sale, and a very large plan, north of $500 million, is not going to fund until 1Q. So once in a while, as we've mentioned before, we're going to get those timing issues. But if you strip out those timing issues and you look into Q1, we're seeing very significant momentum there, both with regard to our sales pipeline, good momentum in the pipeline, and we're also seeing good momentum with regard to retention. So as we look into 2016, certainly, we don't want to get into the prediction business, but we would anticipate a pretty strong positive net cash flow in Q1, and we would look, as Terry said, to be back in that range of 1% to 3% beginning-of-year account values with regard to net cash flow full year."

We know it's top of mind for investors, and we fully appreciate that. I guess, where I start on this question is we've been very active with the trades, we're active with DOL and Congress in better understanding the implications it has as it relates to this fiduciary definition. But from our perspective, job 1 is to protect the interest of the American savers without taking away very valuable education and guidance, which, frankly, most workers are very dependent on. So we've looked at it at basically 3 different inflection points. One is that initial selection of the investments. We think that we've got that appropriately identified and the steps that we'll have to take in order to work with advisers. And so again, we think that that's very manageable. The second is the routine inquiries that we have among our plan participants. They're inquiring about a hardship loan or a standard loan or trying to get some investor education and understand perhaps better the target date investment options. Again, we think that within the definition, there's a way to work with that. We think there's viable solutions. The third is around those job changers, and job changers and retirees. Again, we all know they have 3 options. One is to leave it in the plan. Our reading of the understanding of the rule today would cause perhaps more people to leave it in the plan. There are some benefits from that to the participant. Perhaps fewer investment options, but at the same time, they may very well find that the expenses are lower because it's been aggregated with a large pool of dollars. The second is the rollover IRA, either with Principal or another third party. And then lastly is the cash out, which we think is a bad idea for all the obvious reasons. Again, we'd come back to mapping what that scenario looks like as people are faced with those decisions, and we think there are going to be necessary disclosure and additional steps that will have to be taken. But we've got that fairly well triangulated in terms of the impact. So we know there's more guidance, there's more education, there's more disclosure. We have a large team of people that are hammering away on this issue. We don't think it's a material change to our run rate related to expenses. And like you, we're very anxious about the next 60 to 90 days to see what OMB produces and back to the DOL and what that might start looking like. And I kept that at a fairly high strategic level. But with that as a backdrop, I'll turn it over to Nora to see if she's got any additional color."

We actually have a very large group, a team that's been working on this for a number of months doing scenario planning and engaging with our third-party distribution partners. And the one result of those discussions is it's pretty clear to us, and again, we're speculating on a preliminary reg here, but it's pretty clear to us that there's going to be an array of adviser business models coming out of this change if and when this reg becomes final. Because between ERISA and this new reg, what you see is a huge amount of optionality. Many exceptions, many exemptions. And so various firms and various advisers and various broker-dealers are going to take different routes, from our perspective.

The other part that came out of the White House was to provide some additional tax credits and some additional incentives for small to medium-sized employers to adopt the plan.

So within that space that we've been talking about, stripping out some of the larger plans, we are -- from a net cash flow perspective, we are proving up that we're extremely competitive. And there are 2 things going on there. One is we've got tremendous investment performance in that target date suite, and we've got a huge lineup with regard to target date, whether you want primarily passive, whether you want primarily active, whether you want it in a funds form or in a CIT form. So between the choice and the investment performance, we are highly competitive in that space. And then you add to that the fact that we're price competitive, and that's why we're seeing those kind of positive net cash flows year-over-year in that core small to medium business segment of the industry."

We had record sales in both group benefits and individual disability, record retention, record premium, record earnings.

I'll turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
I'd characterize 2015 as a good year. We delivered after-tax operating earnings of nearly $1.3 billion despite challenging conditions such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and underperformance of the U.S. equity markets, and we returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the benefit of our broad diversification by business, by geography, by investment platform and by asset class. In 2015, Principal continued to build momentum through outstanding investment performance and expansion of distribution and our solutions-based product set. Full year 2015 total company net cash flows of $23 billion were 4% of beginning-of-year assets under management, as we continued to attract and retain retail, retirement and institutional investors. This helped drive assets under management to $527 billion at year-end despite a $28 billion drag from foreign exchange. 
And other major growth highlights for 2015, I’d point to, Principal International's 29th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows with $9 billion of flows for the year, plus another $21 billion of positive flows from our joint venture with China Construction Bank. On a constant currency basis, Principal International grew reported assets under management by 20% in 2015; double-digit earnings growth for Principal Global Investors and nearly $16 billion in positive net cash flows; record earnings for Specialty Benefits on record sales and a 9% growth in premium and fees; continued traction delivering mutual funds, separately managed accounts and annuity-based income solutions; strong underlying growth in plans, participants and reoccurring deposits for our U.S. retirement businesses; and strong Individual Life full year results as claims returned to expected levels. As I said, outstanding investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future growth. For example, 44 of our rated mutual funds or 76% have a 4- or 5-star Morningstar rating. Additionally, as Slide 5 shows, 88%, 89% and 93% of our investment options were in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. And 100% of our target-date funds remained in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods at year-end, driving sales and retention in this key asset class and enabling us to help more individuals achieve financial success. 
From this strong competitive position, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in 2016 and beyond. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to execute on our strategy and further position ourselves for long-term growth. The U.S. remains the largest retirement market in the world, and Principal has maintained its leadership position for decades through exceptional service, product innovation and strong multichannel distribution. With the retail mutual funds business now reporting through Principal Global Investors, Full Service Accumulation is now the majority of Retirement and Income Solutions Fee or RIS-Fee. To be clear, the underlying fundamentals of this business remain strong. We continue to grow plan count across plan sizes, adding nearly 1,300 net new plans in 2015. And we continue to be a leader in start-up plans as we focus on expanding employee coverage. The Principal's core target market of small and medium-sized businesses is underserved, creating an ongoing opportunity for us to uniquely serve this market through our network of local offices and drive consistent growth in this segment. 
Full year reoccurring deposits grew $1.1 billion, up 7% versus 2014. These growth trends highlight the power of the payroll-deduction component of this business, but more importantly, the work we're doing to advocate best-practice plan design with employers and advisers to increase participation and savings rates to better prepare their employees for retirement. Strong alliance firm relationships continue to be a key driver of sales for Retirement and Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors as well as U.S. Insurance Solutions. In 2015, 7 different advisory firms sold more than $1 billion across our offerings, with those firms averaging more than 6 products per platform. In 2015, we continue to do business with more advisers and get our investments added to recommended lists, platforms and model portfolios. In 2015, we had good traction of plan sponsors adopting our retirement readiness plan design. The primary features of these plans are automatic enrollment and automatic savings rate increases. Additionally, we launched an innovative income option in the fourth quarter, which offers an in-plan guaranteed annuity to provide more income security for plan participants. While this business remains under pressure from volatile markets, we expect good growth in sales and flows in 2016, giving meaningful growth in the pipeline. 
Two other points I'd like to emphasize. Our U.S. retirement business continues to be one of the highest-performing businesses in the industry and continues to create tremendous value for the enterprise overall. Slide 6 provides an update on fiduciary regulations. With the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations advancing to the Office of Management and Budget last week, final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. The Principal remains fully engaged to help ensure the final regulations work in favor of individuals trying to save for retirement. We also remain focused on scenario planning and potential changes to business models, with a particular focus on education and guidance, compliance and oversight, provision of investment information, distribution and asset retention. Absent clarity around the final rule, we're not providing a cost estimate at this time. But based on what we know today, we do not expect a significant increase in our run-rate expenses. The Principal has a long history of successfully adapting to complex regulations. Our track record reflects the benefits of scale, products and service breadth and top-tier investments, all critical to meeting the needs of the market and diverse adviser business models. As with prior regulatory developments, we're well positioned and confident we'll emerge among the winners. 
Despite volatility in emerging markets, Principal International continues to demonstrate that we are in the right target markets with marquee distribution partners. As an example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides our joint venture, Brasilprev, access to more than 61 million customers. Customers' confidence in Banco do Brasil and our tax-advantaged individual retirement products helped drive Brasilprev's full year net cash flows to $7 billion. This growth further strengthened Brasilprev's position as the #1 private retirement provider in Brazil in terms of net cash flow and assets. 
Additionally, we continue to gain traction in the voluntary savings market. For example, on a constant currency basis with Chile, volunteer assets under management increased 17% and voluntary fee income increased 25% in 2015. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of our international operations. 
Principal Global Investors, which now include retail and institutional asset management, ended 2015 with $361 billion in assets under management. Institutional sales were strong in 2015, and the pipeline is robust. To counter the broader shift in demand to more passive or low-cost investment options, Principal Global Investors launched solutions in areas where demand for active strategies remain strong, including multiple new real estate offerings and fixed income strategies. We'll continue to add to our ETF suite in 2016 and beyond as well as our portfolio of income solutions, which will include both funds and guaranteed income options. 
In December, The Principal earned the top spot in the category in Pension & Investments' annual survey of Best Places to Work in Money Management for the fourth consecutive year. This award highlights The Principal's strong investment management culture and teams that successfully work to meet client's needs every day, and position us to attract and retain top investment talent. 
Moving now to our insurance businesses. Our focus on small and medium-sized business markets remain a key differentiator, and we continue to find ways to improve the customer experience. In 2015, we piloted our easy-elect group benefits enrollment tool in 7 markets, with meaningful improvement in voluntary participation, as we continue to help individuals understand the importance of protection to broader financial security. 
In closing, I'm optimistic about 2016 and our long-term future, despite the continued global macroeconomic volatility. Strong business fundamentals and our ability to focus on things we can control will continue to drive momentum and generate long-term profitable growth. Terry?"
201105,313906443,925016,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a solid end",1293,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
The fourth quarter was a solid end to a good year. On a reported basis, total company after-tax operating earnings were $303 million, a 6% decrease from the prior-year period, reflecting macroeconomic volatility. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share were $1.02 compared to a normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.07, down 5%. However, on a constant currency basis, earnings per share increased 1% quarter-over-quarter. For full year 2015, reported total company after-tax earnings were nearly $1.3 billion, a 4% decrease from a record 2014. The lower reported earnings in 2015 were primarily driven by lower variable investment income and the impact from currency translation. Year-end 2015 return on equity, excluding AOCI other than the foreign currency translation adjustment, was 14.2%. The daily average change in equity markets is an important driver of the revenue for our fee businesses. In fourth quarter 2015, despite a 6.5% point-to-point increase in the S&P 500, the daily average change for the quarter was slightly higher than 1% compared to third quarter 2015. On a full year basis, S&P 500 daily average increased approximately 7% in 2015 compared to a 17.5% increase in 2014. 
As we look ahead to 2016, if the macroeconomic volatility continues as it has in January, we anticipate a slowdown in revenues in our fee-based businesses. Therefore, we'll focus on things we can control and continue to manage expenses to ensure revenue and expense are aligned. With that said, we will continue to make the necessary investments to keep our competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and our teams remain focused on execution regardless of the macroeconomic environment. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results, starting on Slide 8 with RIS-Fee businesses. Fourth quarter pretax operating earnings of $125 million were down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue decreased 2% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to flat average account values and a decline in variable investment income. Full year 2015 net revenue increased 1% over 2014. Net investment income decreased due to lower variable investment income in 2015 compared to the higher-than-expected levels in 2014. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 31%. After normalizing for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, it was 34%. RIS-Fee had net outflows of $1.6 billion in fourth quarter 2015, despite strong sales of $3.1 billion. Fourth quarter net cash flows reflect exit of a few large cases [ph] due to M&A activity and continued pricing discipline as well as the timing of funding for new sales. As a result, we anticipate strong net cash flows in first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 net cash flows to be 1% to 3% of beginning-of-period account values as we maintain our focus on balancing growth and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $62 million, a 4% increase over the year-ago quarter, primarily due to growth in account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 56%. The pension closeout business had record full year sales of $1.8 billion, which are double 2014 sales. The pipeline remains strong and opportunities in 2016 look promising. 
Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors fourth quarter pretax operating earnings were $102 million, a 2% increase over the prior-year quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion, and pretax operating earnings grew 11% compared to the prior-year period. Pretax return on adjusted revenue increased to 34%. Despite the industry's bias towards passive investment strategies, Principal Global Investors generated full year net cash flows of nearly $16 billion, with $8 billion coming from institutional clients. This is a result of outstanding investment performance and outcome-oriented solutions that are in demand. Additionally, full year management fees increased 9% over 2014, above the 6% growth in average assets under management, demonstrating client preference for higher fee capabilities that, combined with increased scale, led to margin improvement. 
Slide 11 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $67 million. On a constant currency basis, Principal International continues to drive mid-teens earnings growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International's pretax return on net revenue was 38% after normalizing for the third quarter 2015 impairment of intangible assets in Claritas. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $57 million, a 29% increase over the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter premium and fees grew 8% compared to the prior-year quarter, and the overall loss ratio remained favorable at 62%. These are very strong results, even in the seasonally high fourth quarter, due to our focus on the small and medium-sized business market and disciplined profitable growth. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Despite claims experience that was in line with expectation, this is at the low end of our expected range for the quarter, partially due to lower variable revenue. However, full year pretax operating earnings growth was strong year-over-year. For the quarter, total company net income was $254 million, which includes realized capital losses of $48 million. After-tax net credit-related losses of $5 million were slightly better than expected. The losses related to the hedging activities were predominantly due to interest rate and equity market changes. Full year credit-related losses were $20 million, a 65% improvement over 2014 results. Unrealized gains were $1.9 billion, and the portfolio ended the year with a net gain of $1.1 billion. Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. In addition, we have always had a disciplined approach to asset/liability management, and therefore, we are not forced sellers during stressed times. At year-end 2015, our energy portfolio carrying value was 95% of par value. Our overall exposure to the energy sector represents 5.7% of our total fixed maturity portfolio and 4.2% of our total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2015. Our market value exposure in high-yield energy companies as of year-end 2015 was $280 million or less than 1/2 of 1% of total U.S. invested assets. 
Despite the continued market volatility in the beginning of 2016, we remain confident about the strength of our investment portfolio. As outlined on Slide 14, our capital management strategy remains balanced and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Our fee-based businesses drove nearly 70% of 2015 normalized earnings, which generates higher levels of deployable capital and provides greater financial flexibility. In 2015, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, which represented nearly 90% of net income. Our balanced capital deployments include $441 million in common stock dividends, $355 million in strategic acquisitions, and $275 million in share repurchases. The full year common stock dividend was $1.50 per share. This is a 17% increase over full year 2014 as we continue to increase our payout ratio. Additionally, last night, we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in first quarter 2016. 
While we continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities, the current equity market volatility is also providing an opportunity to enhance shareholder value through execution of the remainder of our share buyback authorization. In 2016, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders. In closing, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth. This concludes our prepared remarks.

As we've talked about this before, we always looked at a balanced approach to our capital deployment strategy to enhance long-term shareholder value. As we've stated before, we have more fee-based businesses, predominantly. Pretty close to 70% of our earnings are coming from fee-based businesses, which is less capital intensive. As a result of that, we have an opportunity to deploy more capital. And if you look at what we talked about historically, only about 35% of our capital is needed on an organic basis, leaving close to 65% available for other deployment opportunities. That said, we think that we need to have a balanced approach. We have -- are on track to increase our dividend as a percent of that total net income percentage, closer to 40% over the longer period here. But as you look at share buybacks and you look at M&A opportunities, the M&A opportunities are still very important to us. We want to have an active pipeline, we want to continue to look at that. But as you say, with the valuations as low as they currently are, it makes sense for us to actually deploy capital in terms of buying back our shares because we do believe that they're undervalued at this point in time. It's a very volatile market, so we have to have that disciplined approach. But again, we're going to continue to look at capital deployment strategies, and we said $800 million to $1 billion this year. We expect to be having a very balanced approach, as we've done in the past. But as you said, the opportunities right now are very enticing for the buyback program. And we actually have $75 million of our authorization that's outstanding at this point in time."

The first is that the decline in net flows in the second half of the year was really around some of the large-cap equity strategies, particularly at Columbus Circle and Principal Global Equities, where clients have been looking at the passive alternative and going for lower fee capabilities. Now as you saw from our flows though, we more than replaced that with the higher added-value strategies that we already specialize in, which range through high-yield real estate, small cap, areas that are less-efficient markets. But net-net, it was a slightly down but still positive fourth quarter. And I'd emphasize that because many of our peer group are seeing negative flows. One area where the peer group is seeing negative flows is sovereigns, particularly at central banks and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, which are obviously under severe financial pressure. We have some business in those areas, and we have not seen those outflows yet because we are seeing much stronger investment performance, and we've tended to be among the managers that got retained. We're hopeful that will continue, but obviously there are no guarantees. If I look at the pipeline, which I think was partly where you were going, we have had a very active last 2 months, including over the holidays and in January. And that is unusual. Usually the institutional market globally quiets down during that period, around the end and beginning of the year. But we've seen quote activity and, indeed, fundings looking really quite positive. And I have to say we're feeling pretty optimistic about the flow potential, and that's related to the investment performance that Dan and Terry both mentioned."

As you look at the impact on the fees that occur, it's really more the daily average asset [ph] -- and we use that as a proxy for what the movements in the impact to our account value. So you really look at the average account value from one period to the next period. Now actual performance of those assets also come into play versus the proxy that we use. Last quarter, we talked about a significant drop point-to-point in the S&P 500. That was down 6.7% third quarter over third quarter. That has an impact on the deferred acquisition costs, and that's what we were referencing the last quarter. Now we have an expectation that you'll have anywhere from a 2% to 3% positive impact in that point-to-point time. So if you look at that 2% to 3% versus, say, down nearly 7%, you're talking a 9% to 10% drop that impacts the deferred acquisition model. Now you go forward to this quarter, now the point-to-point was up 6.5%, as you pointed out. Now that has an impact on the expenses, but the differential between what the expectation and what the actual point-to-point was, was much smaller this quarter and didn't have as significant of an impact. Again, that S&P 500 is a proxy for the movement in our actual assets. The actual asset movement was also impacted by -- the domestic markets were strong in the fourth quarter. However, international markets and maybe some of the fixed income investments weren't quite as strong. But I hope that helps. It's really 2 different things: an average account value and the average S&P go hand in hand, and that typically ties to the fee-base, whereas the expenses associated with the acquisition are more of a point-to-point. Now if you look at the deferred acquisition cost for this quarter, they were right in line with what our expectations would be for every one of our businesses. Hope that helps."

What I would talk about in terms of variable investment income is probably prepayment activity that occurs on our mortgages and fixed income investments as well as some real estate sales that we have that also impact that. And typically, I'd look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We benefit from this variable investment income activity by $0.03 to $0.07 a quarter. In 2014, it was well above average because, as you're well aware, everybody was anticipating higher interest rates, and so prepayment activity was really, really high. But we try to call out the variable investment income when it distorts the run rate that is actually in any particular quarter. Now if you look at this particular quarter, this particular quarter, the expectations were right in line with what we would have expected. We saw probably a benefit of variable investment income around $0.04, a little over $0.04. So it's right in line with our expectations. So there was no reason to call it out. Now a year ago, it was slightly higher. And if you actually look out on a run rate basis, we called out probably close to $0.08 -- $0.05 to -- no, probably $0.06 to $0.08 a year ago, which was well above our expectations for the year.

And at the moment, we're seeing the problems in credit really associated with the energy companies, the minors, and to an extent, companies with very large leveraged businesses in emerging markets. So it's quite a tight little part of the credit market. The way that, that would become contagion would be if banks have been foolish enough to get overcommitted in those markets. If that happens, you're going to see a broader credit contagion and, indeed, a lower flow of credit in even the U.S. economy. Your question really was what probability do I see attached to that. We've discussed this at some length within our organization. We have people with a lot of different skills on this. But if I can distill it, I would say, in the next 12 months, that's probably a 20% probability. It's still a negative tail risk. It is most likely that the U.S. and global economy continue growing, albeit at a slower pace than it was before. But we need to be ready to defend if contagion happens and you end up with a worse economy. In particular on Brazil, I think what's gone wrong in Brazil, apart from the obvious political process and commodity prices, is, like China, they kept growth going for quite a long time by expansion of credit, particularly to state-owned enterprises for infrastructure investment and so on. That expansion of credit has probably got to about the limit. So you're into a bit of a debt deflation situation. The IMF, I think it was, just brought down their growth estimate or their recession estimate this year to in excess of 3% from 1%. I think that's quite possible. I think you're going to see another year of pretty severe recession in Brazil, come what may. But this is part of a deleveraging process. And we've seen this with economies that slow a lot. Because people are not spending, there's quite a lot of cash available. And Principal International is taking maximum advantage of that right now. This will pass, it's a phase. It could take a while, but it's one where our business can do, frankly, okay."

Total -- so again, total recurring deposits were up 7% year-over-year, that's the billion number that I think Dan mentioned in the script ahead of time. What you may be focused on is the quarter-over-quarter, which was up only about 3.2%. There's some noise there. We have some DB plan deposit noise there. If we strip that noise away and we don't expect that to recur and we look at those core deferrals, so look at the core deferrals and match, that's actually up really strong quarter-over-quarter, closer to 11%, little bit north of 11%. So both with regard to quarter-over-quarter and trailing 12 months, we're seeing very strong growth in those recurring deposits. We're also seeing very strong growth with regard to the number of participants that are deferring. That percentage is up over 8%. So when you look at the fundamentals of this business, whether you're looking at plan count, again we saw that increase across all of the segments, whether you're looking at start-up plans in the industry, we're now seeing start-up plans 17% above pre-crisis level. So still a huge opportunity in that part of the market that is completely underserved because 50% or so of those smaller employers do not, today, have work site access to retirement. We play in that space extremely well and one of the leaders in that start-up plan market. So the underlying fundamentals here are really, really strong. When you look at the fourth quarter lapses, handful of large cases. Again, we're going to win and lose on an M&A basis. We happen to lose a couple where the acquirer of the plan went to the acquirer. The good news there is the momentum we're seeing. I might add one other thing in Q4 that we saw is one plan that came in as a sale, and a very large plan, north of $500 million, is not going to fund until 1Q. So once in a while, as we've mentioned before, we're going to get those timing issues. But if you strip out those timing issues and you look into Q1, we're seeing very significant momentum there, both with regard to our sales pipeline, good momentum in the pipeline, and we're also seeing good momentum with regard to retention. So as we look into 2016, certainly, we don't want to get into the prediction business, but we would anticipate a pretty strong positive net cash flow in Q1, and we would look, as Terry said, to be back in that range of 1% to 3% beginning-of-year account values with regard to net cash flow full year."

We know it's top of mind for investors, and we fully appreciate that. I guess, where I start on this question is we've been very active with the trades, we're active with DOL and Congress in better understanding the implications it has as it relates to this fiduciary definition. But from our perspective, job 1 is to protect the interest of the American savers without taking away very valuable education and guidance, which, frankly, most workers are very dependent on. So we've looked at it at basically 3 different inflection points. One is that initial selection of the investments. We think that we've got that appropriately identified and the steps that we'll have to take in order to work with advisers. And so again, we think that that's very manageable. The second is the routine inquiries that we have among our plan participants. They're inquiring about a hardship loan or a standard loan or trying to get some investor education and understand perhaps better the target date investment options. Again, we think that within the definition, there's a way to work with that. We think there's viable solutions. The third is around those job changers, and job changers and retirees. Again, we all know they have 3 options. One is to leave it in the plan. Our reading of the understanding of the rule today would cause perhaps more people to leave it in the plan. There are some benefits from that to the participant. Perhaps fewer investment options, but at the same time, they may very well find that the expenses are lower because it's been aggregated with a large pool of dollars. The second is the rollover IRA, either with Principal or another third party. And then lastly is the cash out, which we think is a bad idea for all the obvious reasons. Again, we'd come back to mapping what that scenario looks like as people are faced with those decisions, and we think there are going to be necessary disclosure and additional steps that will have to be taken. But we've got that fairly well triangulated in terms of the impact. So we know there's more guidance, there's more education, there's more disclosure. We have a large team of people that are hammering away on this issue. We don't think it's a material change to our run rate related to expenses. And like you, we're very anxious about the next 60 to 90 days to see what OMB produces and back to the DOL and what that might start looking like. And I kept that at a fairly high strategic level. But with that as a backdrop, I'll turn it over to Nora to see if she's got any additional color."

We go across all the channels, all the firms. So we're out there. We actually have a very large group, a team that's been working on this for a number of months doing scenario planning and engaging with our third-party distribution partners. And the one result of those discussions is it's pretty clear to us, and again, we're speculating on a preliminary reg here, but it's pretty clear to us that there's going to be an array of adviser business models coming out of this change if and when this reg becomes final. Because between ERISA and this new reg, what you see is a huge amount of optionality. Many exceptions, many exemptions. And so various firms and various advisers and various broker-dealers are going to take different routes, from our perspective. Whether they go the fiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, or the nonfiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, whether they use the best interest contract, there's a lot of optionality. What we're doing is working with them and making sure that we're putting the systems in place to be able to service those diverse operating models across our various channels, firms and advisers.

I think you can't just look at the fourth quarter.

So I'd say probably, if you just look at the fourth quarter margins, probably not sustainable, but I think if you look at the full year margins, we feel good about those results and ultimately, can see that there's fundamentals that can carry that into 2016. I think as Dan says, I think the team has done a really, really good job with this business. We had record sales in both group benefits and individual disability, record retention, record premium, record earnings. And I think you when you look at that relative to some of our peers in this business, I think we really do have the fundamentals to drive not just growth, but profitable growth, which is really important in this business.

I'll turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
I'd characterize 2015 as a good year. We delivered after-tax operating earnings of nearly $1.3 billion despite challenging conditions such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and underperformance of the U.S. equity markets, and we returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the benefit of our broad diversification by business, by geography, by investment platform and by asset class. In 2015, Principal continued to build momentum through outstanding investment performance and expansion of distribution and our solutions-based product set. Full year 2015 total company net cash flows of $23 billion were 4% of beginning-of-year assets under management, as we continued to attract and retain retail, retirement and institutional investors. This helped drive assets under management to $527 billion at year-end despite a $28 billion drag from foreign exchange. 
And other major growth highlights for 2015, I’d point to, Principal International's 29th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows with $9 billion of flows for the year, plus another $21 billion of positive flows from our joint venture with China Construction Bank. On a constant currency basis, Principal International grew reported assets under management by 20% in 2015; double-digit earnings growth for Principal Global Investors and nearly $16 billion in positive net cash flows; record earnings for Specialty Benefits on record sales and a 9% growth in premium and fees; continued traction delivering mutual funds, separately managed accounts and annuity-based income solutions; strong underlying growth in plans, participants and reoccurring deposits for our U.S. retirement businesses; and strong Individual Life full year results as claims returned to expected levels. As I said, outstanding investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future growth. For example, 44 of our rated mutual funds or 76% have a 4- or 5-star Morningstar rating. Additionally, as Slide 5 shows, 88%, 89% and 93% of our investment options were in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. And 100% of our target date funds remained in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods at year-end, driving sales and retention in this key asset class and enabling us to help more individuals achieve financial success. 
From this strong competitive position, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in 2016 and beyond. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to execute on our strategy and further position ourselves for long-term growth. The U.S. remains the largest retirement market in the world, and Principal has maintained its leadership position for decades through exceptional service, product innovation and strong multichannel distribution. With the retail mutual funds business now reporting through Principal Global Investors, Full Service Accumulation is now the majority of Retirement and Income Solutions Fee or RIS-Fee. To be clear, the underlying fundamentals of this business remain strong. We continue to grow plan count across plan sizes, adding nearly 1,300 net new plans in 2015. And we continue to be a leader in start-up plans as we focus on expanding employee coverage. The Principal's core target market of small and medium-sized businesses is underserved, creating an ongoing opportunity for us to uniquely serve this market through our network of local offices and drive consistent growth in this segment. 
Full year reoccurring deposits grew $1.1 billion, up 7% versus 2014. These growth trends highlight the power of the payroll deduction component of this business, but more importantly, the work we're doing to advocate best-practice plan design with employers and advisers to increase participation and savings rates to better prepare their employees for retirement. Strong alliance firm relationships continue to be a key driver of sales for Retirement and Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors as well as U.S. Insurance Solutions. In 2015, 7 different advisory firms sold more than $1 billion across our offerings, with those firms averaging more than 6 products per platform. In 2015, we continue to do business with more advisers and get our investments added to recommended lists, platforms and model portfolios. In 2015, we had good traction of plan sponsors adopting our retirement readiness plan design. The primary features of these plans are automatic enrollment and automatic savings rate increases. Additionally, we launched an innovative income option in the fourth quarter, which offers an in-plan guaranteed annuity to provide more income security for plan participants. While this business remains under pressure from volatile markets, we expect good growth in sales and flows in 2016, giving meaningful growth in the pipeline. 
Two other points I'd like to emphasize. Our U.S. retirement business continues to be one of the highest performing businesses in the industry and continues to create tremendous value for the enterprise overall. Slide 6 provides an update on fiduciary regulations. With the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations advancing to the Office of Management and Budget last week, final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. The Principal remains fully engaged to help ensure the final regulations work in favor of individuals trying to save for retirement. We also remain focused on scenario planning and potential changes to business models, with a particular focus on education and guidance, compliance and oversight, provision of investment information, distribution and asset retention. Absent clarity around the final rule, we're not providing a cost estimate at this time. But based on what we know today, we do not expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. The Principal has a long history of successfully adapting to complex regulations. Our track record reflects the benefits of scale, products and service breadth and top-tier investments, all critical to meeting the needs of the market and diverse adviser business models. As with prior regulatory developments, we're well positioned and confident we'll emerge among the winners. 
Despite volatility in emerging markets, Principal International continues to demonstrate that we are in the right target markets with marquee distribution partners. As an example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides our joint venture, Brasilprev, access to more than 61 million customers. Customers' confidence in Banco do Brasil and our tax-advantaged individual retirement products helped drive Brasilprev's full year net cash flows to $7 billion. This growth further strengthened Brasilprev's position as the #1 private retirement provider in Brazil in terms of net cash flow and assets. 
Additionally, we continue to gain traction in the voluntary savings market. For example, on a constant currency basis with Chile, volunteer assets under management increased 17% and voluntary fee income increased 25% in 2015. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of our international operations. 
Principal Global Investors, which now include retail and institutional asset management, ended 2015 with $361 billion in assets under management. Institutional sales were strong in 2015, and the pipeline is robust. To counter the broader shift in demand to more passive or low-cost investment options, Principal Global Investors launched solutions in areas where demand for active strategies remain strong, including multiple new real estate offerings and fixed income strategies. We'll continue to add to our ETF suite in 2016 and beyond as well as our portfolio of income solutions, which will include both funds and guaranteed income options. 
In December, The Principal earned the top spot in the category in Pension & Investments' annual survey of Best Places to Work in Money Management for the fourth consecutive year. This award highlights The Principal's strong investment management culture and teams that successfully work to meet client's needs every day, and position us to attract and retain top investment talent. 
Moving now to our insurance businesses. Our focus on small and medium-sized business markets remain a key differentiator, and we continue to find ways to improve the customer experience. In 2015, we piloted our easy-elect group benefits enrollment tool in 7 markets, with meaningful improvement in voluntary participation, as we continue to help individuals understand the importance of protection to broader financial security. 
In closing, I'm optimistic about 2016 and our long-term future, despite the continued global macroeconomic volatility. Strong business fundamentals and our ability to focus on things we can control will continue to drive momentum and generate long-term profitable growth. Terry?"
201105,313906443,925096,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a solid end",1301,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
The fourth quarter was a solid end to a good year. On a reported basis, total company after-tax operating earnings were $303 million, a 6% decrease from the prior year period, reflecting macroeconomic volatility. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share were $1.02 compared to a normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.07, down 5%. However, on a constant currency basis, earnings per share increased 1% quarter-over-quarter. For full year 2015, reported total company after-tax earnings were nearly $1.3 billion, a 4% decrease from a record 2014. The lower reported earnings in 2015 were primarily driven by lower variable investment income and the impact from currency translation. Year-end 2015 return on equity, excluding AOCI other than the foreign currency translation adjustment, was 14.2%. The daily average change in equity markets is an important driver of the revenue for our fee businesses. In fourth quarter 2015, despite a 6.5% point-to-point increase in the S&P 500, the daily average change for the quarter was slightly higher than 1% compared to third quarter 2015. On a full year basis, S&P 500 daily average increased approximately 7% in 2015 compared to a 17.5% increase in 2014. 
As we look ahead to 2016, if the macroeconomic volatility continues as it has in January, we anticipate a slowdown in revenues in our fee-based businesses. Therefore, we'll focus on things we can control and continue to manage expenses to ensure revenue and expense are aligned. With that said, we will continue to make the necessary investments to keep our competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and our teams remain focused on execution regardless of the macroeconomic environment. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results, starting on Slide 8 with RIS-Fee businesses. Fourth quarter pretax operating earnings of $125 million were down 10% from the year ago quarter. Net revenue decreased 2% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to flat average account values and a decline in variable investment income. Full year 2015 net revenue increased 1% over 2014. Net investment income decreased due to lower variable investment income in 2015 compared to the higher-than-expected levels in 2014. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 31%. After normalizing for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, it was 34%. RIS-Fee had net outflows of $1.6 billion in fourth quarter 2015, despite strong sales of $3.1 billion. Fourth quarter net cash flows reflect exit of a few large cases [ph] due to M&A activity and continued pricing discipline as well as the timing of funding for new sales. As a result, we anticipate strong net cash flows in first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 net cash flows to be 1% to 3% of beginning-of-period account values as we maintain our focus on balancing growth and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $62 million, a 4% increase over the year ago quarter, primarily due to growth in account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 56%. The pension closeout business had record full year sales of $1.8 billion, which are double 2014 sales. The pipeline remains strong and opportunities in 2016 look promising. 
Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors fourth quarter pretax operating earnings were $102 million, a 2% increase over the prior year quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion, and pretax operating earnings grew 11% compared to the prior year period. Pretax return on adjusted revenue increased to 34%. Despite the industry's bias towards passive investment strategies, Principal Global Investors generated full year net cash flows of nearly $16 billion, with $8 billion coming from institutional clients. This is a result of outstanding investment performance and outcome-oriented solutions that are in demand. Additionally, full year management fees increased 9% over 2014, above the 6% growth in average assets under management, demonstrating client preference for higher fee capabilities that, combined with increased scale, led to margin improvement. 
Slide 11 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $67 million. On a constant currency basis, Principal International continues to drive mid-teens earnings growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International's pretax return on net revenue was 38% after normalizing for the third quarter 2015 impairment of intangible assets in Claritas. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $57 million, a 29% increase over the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter premium and fees grew 8% compared to the prior year quarter, and the overall loss ratio remained favorable at 62%. These are very strong results, even in the seasonally high fourth quarter, due to our focus on the small and medium-sized business market and disciplined profitable growth. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Despite claims experience that was in line with expectation, this is at the low end of our expected range for the quarter, partially due to lower variable revenue. However, full year pretax operating earnings growth was strong year-over-year. For the quarter, total company net income was $254 million, which includes realized capital losses of $48 million. After-tax net credit-related losses of $5 million were slightly better than expected. The losses related to the hedging activities were predominantly due to interest rate and equity market changes. Full year credit-related losses were $20 million, a 65% improvement over 2014 results. Unrealized gains were $1.9 billion, and the portfolio ended the year with a net gain of $1.1 billion. Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. In addition, we have always had a disciplined approach to asset/liability management, and therefore, we are not forced sellers during stressed times. At year-end 2015, our energy portfolio carrying value was 95% of par value. Our overall exposure to the energy sector represents 5.7% of our total fixed maturity portfolio and 4.2% of our total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2015. Our market value exposure in high-yield energy companies as of year-end 2015 was $280 million or less than 1/2 of 1% of total U.S. invested assets. 
Despite the continued market volatility in the beginning of 2016, we remain confident about the strength of our investment portfolio. As outlined on Slide 14, our capital management strategy remains balanced and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Our fee-based businesses drove nearly 70% of 2015 normalized earnings, which generates higher levels of deployable capital and provides greater financial flexibility. In 2015, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, which represented nearly 90% of net income. Our balanced capital deployments include $441 million in common stock dividends, $355 million in strategic acquisitions, and $275 million in share repurchases. The full year common stock dividend was $1.50 per share. This is a 17% increase over full year 2014 as we continue to increase our payout ratio. Additionally, last night, we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in first quarter 2016. 
While we continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities, the current equity market volatility is also providing an opportunity to enhance shareholder value through execution of the remainder of our share buyback authorization. In 2016, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders. In closing, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth. This concludes our prepared remarks.

As we've talked about this before, we always looked at a balanced approach to our capital deployment strategy to enhance long-term shareholder value. As we've stated before, we have more fee-based businesses, predominantly. Pretty close to 70% of our earnings are coming from fee-based businesses, which is less capital intensive. As a result of that, we have an opportunity to deploy more capital. And if you look at what we talked about historically, only about 35% of our capital is needed on an organic basis, leaving close to 65% available for other deployment opportunities. That said, we think that we need to have a balanced approach. We have -- are on track to increase our dividend as a percent of that total net income percentage, closer to 40% over the longer period here. But as you look at share buybacks and you look at M&A opportunities, the M&A opportunities are still very important to us. We want to have an active pipeline, we want to continue to look at that. But as you say, with the valuations as low as they currently are, it makes sense for us to actually deploy capital in terms of buying back our shares because we do believe that they're undervalued at this point in time. It's a very volatile market, so we have to have that disciplined approach. But again, we're going to continue to look at capital deployment strategies, and we said $800 million to $1 billion this year. We expect to be having a very balanced approach, as we've done in the past. But as you said, the opportunities right now are very enticing for the buyback program. And we actually have $75 million of our authorization that's outstanding at this point in time."

I think about that in the context of Jim coalescing the mutual fund team along with the institutional team. When you look at the broader industry, we've seen actually a lot of declines, significant declines, negative net cash flow. So frankly, when we evaluate Principal Global Investors and Jim's leadership in this area, we think we've got a very strong result for the quarter and certainly for the year. But Jim, certainly you can add some color to that."

The first is that the decline in net flows in the second half of the year was really around some of the large cap equity strategies, particularly at Columbus Circle and Principal Global Equities, where clients have been looking at the passive alternative and going for lower fee capabilities. Now as you saw from our flows though, we more than replaced that with the higher added-value strategies that we already specialize in, which range through high-yield real estate, small cap, areas that are less-efficient markets. But net-net, it was a slightly down but still positive fourth quarter. And I'd emphasize that because many of our peer group are seeing negative flows. One area where the peer group is seeing negative flows is sovereigns, particularly at central banks and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, which are obviously under severe financial pressure. We have some business in those areas, and we have not seen those outflows yet because we are seeing much stronger investment performance, and we've tended to be among the managers that got retained. We're hopeful that will continue, but obviously there are no guarantees. If I look at the pipeline, which I think was partly where you were going, we have had a very active last 2 months, including over the holidays and in January. And that is unusual. Usually the institutional market globally quiets down during that period, around the end and beginning of the year. But we've seen quote activity and, indeed, fundings looking really quite positive. And I have to say we're feeling pretty optimistic about the flow potential, and that's related to the investment performance that Dan and Terry both mentioned."

As you look at the impact on the fees that occur, it's really more the daily average asset [ph] -- and we use that as a proxy for what the movements in the impact to our account value. So you really look at the average account value from one period to the next period. Now actual performance of those assets also come into play versus the proxy that we use. Last quarter, we talked about a significant drop point-to-point in the S&P 500. That was down 6.7% third quarter over third quarter. That has an impact on the deferred acquisition costs, and that's what we were referencing the last quarter. Now we have an expectation that you'll have anywhere from a 2% to 3% positive impact in that point-to-point time. So if you look at that 2% to 3% versus, say, down nearly 7%, you're talking a 9% to 10% drop that impacts the deferred acquisition model. Now you go forward to this quarter, now the point-to-point was up 6.5%, as you pointed out. Now that has an impact on the expenses, but the differential between what the expectation and what the actual point-to-point was, was much smaller this quarter and didn't have as significant of an impact. Again, that S&P 500 is a proxy for the movement in our actual assets. The actual asset movement was also impacted by -- the domestic markets were strong in the fourth quarter. However, international markets and maybe some of the fixed income investments weren't quite as strong. But I hope that helps. It's really 2 different things: an average account value and the average S&P go hand in hand, and that typically ties to the fee-base, whereas the expenses associated with the acquisition are more of a point-to-point. Now if you look at the deferred acquisition cost for this quarter, they were right in line with what our expectations would be for every one of our businesses. Hope that helps."

As you talk about variable investment income, there's a lot of components that go into that. What I would talk about in terms of variable investment income is probably prepayment activity that occurs on our mortgages and fixed income investments as well as some real estate sales that we have that also impact that. And typically, I'd look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We benefit from this variable investment income activity by $0.03 to $0.07 a quarter. In 2014, it was well above average because, as you're well aware, everybody was anticipating higher interest rates, and so prepayment activity was really, really high. But we try to call out the variable investment income when it distorts the run rate that is actually in any particular quarter. Now if you look at this particular quarter, this particular quarter, the expectations were right in line with what we would have expected. We saw probably a benefit of variable investment income around $0.04, a little over $0.04. So it's right in line with our expectations. So there was no reason to call it out. Now a year ago, it was slightly higher. And if you actually look out on a run rate basis, we called out probably close to $0.08 -- $0.05 to -- no, probably $0.06 to $0.08 a year ago, which was well above our expectations for the year.

And at the moment, we're seeing the problems in credit really associated with the energy companies, the minors, and to an extent, companies with very large leveraged businesses in emerging markets. So it's quite a tight little part of the credit market. The way that, that would become contagion would be if banks have been foolish enough to get overcommitted in those markets. If that happens, you're going to see a broader credit contagion and, indeed, a lower flow of credit in even the U.S. economy. Your question really was what probability do I see attached to that. We've discussed this at some length within our organization. We have people with a lot of different skills on this. But if I can distill it, I would say, in the next 12 months, that's probably a 20% probability. It's still a negative tail risk. It is most likely that the U.S. and global economy continue growing, albeit at a slower pace than it was before. But we need to be ready to defend if contagion happens and you end up with a worse economy. In particular on Brazil, I think what's gone wrong in Brazil, apart from the obvious political process and commodity prices, is, like China, they kept growth going for quite a long time by expansion of credit, particularly to state-owned enterprises for infrastructure investment and so on. That expansion of credit has probably got to about the limit. So you're into a bit of a debt deflation situation. The IMF, I think it was, just brought down their growth estimate or their recession estimate this year to in excess of 3% from 1%. I think that's quite possible. I think you're going to see another year of pretty severe recession in Brazil, come what may. But this is part of a deleveraging process. And we've seen this with economies that slow a lot. Because people are not spending, there's quite a lot of cash available. And Principal International is taking maximum advantage of that right now. This will pass, it's a phase. It could take a while, but it's one where our business can do, frankly, okay."

What you may be focused on is the quarter-over-quarter, which was up only about 3.2%. There's some noise there. We have some DB plan deposit noise there. If we strip that noise away and we don't expect that to recur and we look at those core deferrals, so look at the core deferrals and match, that's actually up really strong quarter-over-quarter, closer to 11%, little bit north of 11%. So both with regard to quarter-over-quarter and trailing 12 months, we're seeing very strong growth in those recurring deposits. We're also seeing very strong growth with regard to the number of participants that are deferring. That percentage is up over 8%. So when you look at the fundamentals of this business, whether you're looking at plan count, again we saw that increase across all of the segments, whether you're looking at start-up plans in the industry, we're now seeing start-up plans 17% above pre-crisis level. So still a huge opportunity in that part of the market that is completely underserved because 50% or so of those smaller employers do not, today, have work site access to retirement. We play in that space extremely well and one of the leaders in that start-up plan market. So the underlying fundamentals here are really, really strong. When you look at the fourth quarter lapses, handful of large cases. Again, we're going to win and lose on an M&A basis. We happen to lose a couple where the acquirer of the plan went to the acquirer. The good news there is the momentum we're seeing. I might add one other thing in Q4 that we saw is one plan that came in as a sale, and a very large plan, north of $500 million, is not going to fund until 1Q. So once in a while, as we've mentioned before, we're going to get those timing issues. But if you strip out those timing issues and you look into Q1, we're seeing very significant momentum there, both with regard to our sales pipeline, good momentum in the pipeline, and we're also seeing good momentum with regard to retention. So as we look into 2016, certainly, we don't want to get into the prediction business, but we would anticipate a pretty strong positive net cash flow in Q1, and we would look, as Terry said, to be back in that range of 1% to 3% beginning-of-year account values with regard to net cash flow full year."

Specific to capital, obviously, there's a number of things that we continue to look at to make sure that we're pulling those levers when and if they make sense, and the closed block is one that is -- currently does provide an opportunity, and we're just working together with Terry and Tim to determine when the right time might be to do that. Obviously, we want to have a place to deploy that. The rating agencies are more concerned on making sure we keep that within our life insurance company perspective. And so again, I think it's probably more a matter of when rather than if, but we do think it's an opportunity that we could pull at some point in time."

We know it's top of mind for investors, and we fully appreciate that. I guess, where I start on this question is we've been very active with the trades, we're active with DOL and Congress in better understanding the implications it has as it relates to this fiduciary definition. But from our perspective, job 1 is to protect the interest of the American savers without taking away very valuable education and guidance, which, frankly, most workers are very dependent on. So we've looked at it at basically 3 different inflection points. One is that initial selection of the investments. We think that we've got that appropriately identified and the steps that we'll have to take in order to work with advisers. And so again, we think that that's very manageable. The second is the routine inquiries that we have among our plan participants. They're inquiring about a hardship loan or a standard loan or trying to get some investor education and understand perhaps better the target date investment options. Again, we think that within the definition, there's a way to work with that. We think there's viable solutions. The third is around those job changers, and job changers and retirees. Again, we all know they have 3 options. One is to leave it in the plan. Our reading of the understanding of the rule today would cause perhaps more people to leave it in the plan. There are some benefits from that to the participant. Perhaps fewer investment options, but at the same time, they may very well find that the expenses are lower because it's been aggregated with a large pool of dollars. The second is the rollover IRA, either with Principal or another third party. And then lastly is the cash out, which we think is a bad idea for all the obvious reasons. Again, we'd come back to mapping what that scenario looks like as people are faced with those decisions, and we think there are going to be necessary disclosure and additional steps that will have to be taken. But we've got that fairly well triangulated in terms of the impact. So we know there's more guidance, there's more education, there's more disclosure. We have a large team of people that are hammering away on this issue. We don't think it's a material change to our run rate related to expenses. And like you, we're very anxious about the next 60 to 90 days to see what OMB produces and back to the DOL and what that might start looking like. And I kept that at a fairly high strategic level. But with that as a backdrop, I'll turn it over to Nora to see if she's got any additional color."

We go across all the channels, all the firms. So we're out there. We actually have a very large group, a team that's been working on this for a number of months doing scenario planning and engaging with our third-party distribution partners. And the one result of those discussions is it's pretty clear to us, and again, we're speculating on a preliminary reg here, but it's pretty clear to us that there's going to be an array of adviser business models coming out of this change if and when this reg becomes final. Because between ERISA and this new reg, what you see is a huge amount of optionality. Many exceptions, many exemptions. And so various firms and various advisers and various broker-dealers are going to take different routes, from our perspective. Whether they go the fiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, or the nonfiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, whether they use the best interest contract, there's a lot of optionality. What we're doing is working with them and making sure that we're putting the systems in place to be able to service those diverse operating models across our various channels, firms and advisers. And we feel pretty optimistic that at the end of the day, somebody like us, who's got the scale and the expertise and the discipline to really work channel-by-channel, firm-by-firm, is going to have a really elegant solution to an unbelievably complex set of regulations."

So within that space that we've been talking about, stripping out some of the larger plans, we are -- from a net cash flow perspective, we are proving up that we're extremely competitive. And there are 2 things going on there. One is we've got tremendous investment performance in that target date suite, and we've got a huge lineup with regard to target date, whether you want primarily passive, whether you want primarily active, whether you want it in a funds form or in a CIT form. So between the choice and the investment performance, we are highly competitive in that space.

Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial results and certain accomplishments that position us for continued growth in 2016 and beyond. I'll turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
I'd characterize 2015 as a good year. We delivered after-tax operating earnings of nearly $1.3 billion despite challenging conditions such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and underperformance of the U.S. equity markets, and we returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the benefit of our broad diversification by business, by geography, by investment platform and by asset class. In 2015, Principal continued to build momentum through outstanding investment performance and expansion of distribution and our solutions-based product set. Full year 2015 total company net cash flows of $23 billion were 4% of beginning-of-year assets under management, as we continued to attract and retain retail, retirement and institutional investors. This helped drive assets under management to $527 billion at year-end despite a $28 billion drag from foreign exchange. 
And other major growth highlights for 2015, I’d point to, Principal International's 29th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows with $9 billion of flows for the year, plus another $21 billion of positive flows from our joint venture with China Construction Bank. On a constant currency basis, Principal International grew reported assets under management by 20% in 2015; double-digit earnings growth for Principal Global Investors and nearly $16 billion in positive net cash flows; record earnings for Specialty Benefits on record sales and a 9% growth in premium and fees; continued traction delivering mutual funds, separately managed accounts and annuity-based income solutions; strong underlying growth in plans, participants and reoccurring deposits for our U.S. retirement businesses; and strong Individual Life full year results as claims returned to expected levels. As I said, outstanding investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future growth. For example, 44 of our rated mutual funds or 76% have a 4- or 5-star Morningstar rating. Additionally, as Slide 5 shows, 88%, 89% and 93% of our investment options were in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. And 100% of our target date funds remained in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods at year-end, driving sales and retention in this key asset class and enabling us to help more individuals achieve financial success. 
From this strong competitive position, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth in 2016 and beyond. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to execute on our strategy and further position ourselves for long-term growth. The U.S. remains the largest retirement market in the world, and Principal has maintained its leadership position for decades through exceptional service, product innovation and strong multichannel distribution. With the retail mutual funds business now reporting through Principal Global Investors, Full Service Accumulation is now the majority of Retirement and Income Solutions Fee or RIS-Fee. To be clear, the underlying fundamentals of this business remain strong. We continue to grow plan count across plan sizes, adding nearly 1,300 net new plans in 2015. And we continue to be a leader in start-up plans as we focus on expanding employee coverage. The Principal's core target market of small and medium-sized businesses is underserved, creating an ongoing opportunity for us to uniquely serve this market through our network of local offices and drive consistent growth in this segment. 
Full year reoccurring deposits grew $1.1 billion, up 7% versus 2014. These growth trends highlight the power of the payroll deduction component of this business, but more importantly, the work we're doing to advocate best-practice plan design with employers and advisers to increase participation and savings rates to better prepare their employees for retirement. Strong alliance firm relationships continue to be a key driver of sales for Retirement and Income Solutions, Principal Global Investors as well as U.S. Insurance Solutions. In 2015, 7 different advisory firms sold more than $1 billion across our offerings, with those firms averaging more than 6 products per platform. In 2015, we continue to do business with more advisers and get our investments added to recommended lists, platforms and model portfolios. In 2015, we had good traction of plan sponsors adopting our retirement readiness plan design. The primary features of these plans are automatic enrollment and automatic savings rate increases. Additionally, we launched an innovative income option in the fourth quarter, which offers an in-plan guaranteed annuity to provide more income security for plan participants. While this business remains under pressure from volatile markets, we expect good growth in sales and flows in 2016, giving meaningful growth in the pipeline. 
Two other points I'd like to emphasize. Our U.S. retirement business continues to be one of the highest performing businesses in the industry and continues to create tremendous value for the enterprise overall. Slide 6 provides an update on fiduciary regulations. With the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations advancing to the Office of Management and Budget last week, final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. The Principal remains fully engaged to help ensure the final regulations work in favor of individuals trying to save for retirement. We also remain focused on scenario planning and potential changes to business models, with a particular focus on education and guidance, compliance and oversight, provision of investment information, distribution and asset retention. Absent clarity around the final rule, we're not providing a cost estimate at this time. But based on what we know today, we do not expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. The Principal has a long history of successfully adapting to complex regulations. Our track record reflects the benefits of scale, products and service breadth and top-tier investments, all critical to meeting the needs of the market and diverse adviser business models. As with prior regulatory developments, we're well positioned and confident we'll emerge among the winners. 
Despite volatility in emerging markets, Principal International continues to demonstrate that we are in the right target markets with marquee distribution partners. As an example, our long-term exclusive distribution partnership with Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Latin America, provides our joint venture, Brasilprev, access to more than 61 million customers. Customers' confidence in Banco do Brasil and our tax-advantaged individual retirement products helped drive Brasilprev's full year net cash flows to $7 billion. This growth further strengthened Brasilprev's position as the #1 private retirement provider in Brazil in terms of net cash flow and assets. 
Additionally, we continue to gain traction in the voluntary savings market. For example, on a constant currency basis with Chile, volunteer assets under management increased 17% and voluntary fee income increased 25% in 2015. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of our international operations. 
Principal Global Investors, which now include retail and institutional asset management, ended 2015 with $361 billion in assets under management. Institutional sales were strong in 2015, and the pipeline is robust. To counter the broader shift in demand to more passive or low-cost investment options, Principal Global Investors launched solutions in areas where demand for active strategies remain strong, including multiple new real estate offerings and fixed income strategies. We'll continue to add to our ETF suite in 2016 and beyond as well as our portfolio of income solutions, which will include both funds and guaranteed income options. 
In December, The Principal earned the top spot in the category in Pension & Investments' annual survey of Best Places to Work in Money Management for the fourth consecutive year. This award highlights The Principal's strong investment management culture and teams that successfully work to meet client's needs every day, and position us to attract and retain top investment talent. 
Moving now to our insurance businesses. Our focus on small and medium-sized business markets remain a key differentiator, and we continue to find ways to improve the customer experience. In 2015, we piloted our easy-elect group benefits enrollment tool in 7 markets, with meaningful improvement in voluntary participation, as we continue to help individuals understand the importance of protection to broader financial security. 
In closing, I'm optimistic about 2016 and our long-term future, despite the continued global macroeconomic volatility. Strong business fundamentals and our ability to focus on things we can control will continue to drive momentum and generate long-term profitable growth. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. The fourth quarter was a solid end",1301,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter and full year; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
The fourth quarter was a solid end to a good year. On a reported basis, total company after-tax operating earnings were $303 million, a 6% decrease from the prior year period, reflecting macroeconomic volatility. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that fourth quarter 2015 earnings per share were $1.02 compared to a normalized fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.07, down 5%. However, on a constant currency basis, earnings per share increased 1% quarter-over-quarter. For full year 2015, reported total company after-tax earnings were nearly $1.3 billion, a 4% decrease from a record 2014. The lower reported earnings in 2015 were primarily driven by lower variable investment income and the impact from currency translation. Year-end 2015 return on equity, excluding AOCI other than the foreign currency translation adjustment, was 14.2%. The daily average change in equity markets is an important driver of the revenue for our fee businesses. In fourth quarter 2015, despite a 6.5% point-to-point increase in the S&P 500, the daily average change for the quarter was slightly higher than 1% compared to third quarter 2015. On a full year basis, S&P 500 daily average increased approximately 7% in 2015 compared to a 17.5% increase in 2014. 
As we look ahead to 2016, if the macroeconomic volatility continues as it has in January, we anticipate a slowdown in revenues in our fee-based businesses. Therefore, we'll focus on things we can control and continue to manage expenses to ensure revenue and expense are aligned. With that said, we will continue to make the necessary investments to keep our competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and our teams remain focused on execution regardless of the macroeconomic environment. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results, starting on Slide 8 with RIS-Fee businesses. Fourth quarter pretax operating earnings of $125 million were down 10% from the year ago quarter. Net revenue decreased 2% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to flat average account values and a decline in variable investment income. Full year 2015 net revenue increased 1% over 2014. Net investment income decreased due to lower variable investment income in 2015 compared to the higher-than-expected levels in 2014. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 31%. After normalizing for the third quarter actuarial assumption review, it was 34%. RIS-Fee had net outflows of $1.6 billion in fourth quarter 2015, despite strong sales of $3.1 billion. Fourth quarter net cash flows reflect exit of a few large cases [ph] due to M&A activity and continued pricing discipline as well as the timing of funding for new sales. As a result, we anticipate strong net cash flows in first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 net cash flows to be 1% to 3% of beginning-of-period account values as we maintain our focus on balancing growth and profitability. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $62 million, a 4% increase over the year ago quarter, primarily due to growth in account values. On a trailing 12-month basis, pretax return on net revenue was 56%. The pension closeout business had record full year sales of $1.8 billion, which are double 2014 sales. The pipeline remains strong and opportunities in 2016 look promising. 
Slide 10 shows Principal Global Investors fourth quarter pretax operating earnings were $102 million, a 2% increase over the prior year quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion, and pretax operating earnings grew 11% compared to the prior year period. Pretax return on adjusted revenue increased to 34%. Despite the industry's bias towards passive investment strategies, Principal Global Investors generated full year net cash flows of nearly $16 billion, with $8 billion coming from institutional clients. This is a result of outstanding investment performance and outcome-oriented solutions that are in demand. Additionally, full year management fees increased 9% over 2014, above the 6% growth in average assets under management, demonstrating client preference for higher fee capabilities that, combined with increased scale, led to margin improvement. 
Slide 11 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $67 million. On a constant currency basis, Principal International continues to drive mid-teens earnings growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, Principal International's pretax return on net revenue was 38% after normalizing for the third quarter 2015 impairment of intangible assets in Claritas. 
Moving to Slide 12. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $57 million, a 29% increase over the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter premium and fees grew 8% compared to the prior year quarter, and the overall loss ratio remained favorable at 62%. These are very strong results, even in the seasonally high fourth quarter, due to our focus on the small and medium-sized business market and disciplined profitable growth. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $30 million for the quarter. Despite claims experience that was in line with expectation, this is at the low end of our expected range for the quarter, partially due to lower variable revenue. However, full year pretax operating earnings growth was strong year-over-year. For the quarter, total company net income was $254 million, which includes realized capital losses of $48 million. After-tax net credit-related losses of $5 million were slightly better than expected. The losses related to the hedging activities were predominantly due to interest rate and equity market changes. Full year credit-related losses were $20 million, a 65% improvement over 2014 results. Unrealized gains were $1.9 billion, and the portfolio ended the year with a net gain of $1.1 billion. Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, property type and individual credit exposures. In addition, we have always had a disciplined approach to asset/liability management, and therefore, we are not forced sellers during stressed times. At year-end 2015, our energy portfolio carrying value was 95% of par value. Our overall exposure to the energy sector represents 5.7% of our total fixed maturity portfolio and 4.2% of our total U.S. invested assets as of December 31, 2015. Our market value exposure in high-yield energy companies as of year-end 2015 was $280 million or less than 1/2 of 1% of total U.S. invested assets. 
Despite the continued market volatility in the beginning of 2016, we remain confident about the strength of our investment portfolio. As outlined on Slide 14, our capital management strategy remains balanced and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Our fee-based businesses drove nearly 70% of 2015 normalized earnings, which generates higher levels of deployable capital and provides greater financial flexibility. In 2015, we deployed $1.1 billion of capital, which represented nearly 90% of net income. Our balanced capital deployments include $441 million in common stock dividends, $355 million in strategic acquisitions, and $275 million in share repurchases. The full year common stock dividend was $1.50 per share. This is a 17% increase over full year 2014 as we continue to increase our payout ratio. Additionally, last night, we announced a $0.38 per share common stock dividend payable in first quarter 2016. 
While we continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities, the current equity market volatility is also providing an opportunity to enhance shareholder value through execution of the remainder of our share buyback authorization. In 2016, we expect to deploy $800 million to $1 billion of capital in a strategic and balanced manner to enhance long-term value for shareholders. In closing, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we remain confident that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth. This concludes our prepared remarks.

As we've talked about this before, we always looked at a balanced approach to our capital deployment strategy to enhance long-term shareholder value. As we've stated before, we have more fee-based businesses, predominantly. Pretty close to 70% of our earnings are coming from fee-based businesses, which is less capital intensive. As a result of that, we have an opportunity to deploy more capital. And if you look at what we talked about historically, only about 35% of our capital is needed on an organic basis, leaving close to 65% available for other deployment opportunities. That said, we think that we need to have a balanced approach. We have -- are on track to increase our dividend as a percent of that total net income percentage, closer to 40% over the longer period here. But as you look at share buybacks and you look at M&A opportunities, the M&A opportunities are still very important to us. We want to have an active pipeline, we want to continue to look at that. But as you say, with the valuations as low as they currently are, it makes sense for us to actually deploy capital in terms of buying back our shares because we do believe that they're undervalued at this point in time. It's a very volatile market, so we have to have that disciplined approach. But again, we're going to continue to look at capital deployment strategies, and we said $800 million to $1 billion this year. We expect to be having a very balanced approach, as we've done in the past. But as you said, the opportunities right now are very enticing for the buyback program. And we actually have $75 million of our authorization that's outstanding at this point in time."

The first is that the decline in net flows in the second half of the year was really around some of the large cap equity strategies, particularly at Columbus Circle and Principal Global Equities, where clients have been looking at the passive alternative and going for lower fee capabilities. Now as you saw from our flows though, we more than replaced that with the higher added-value strategies that we already specialize in, which range through high-yield real estate, small cap, areas that are less-efficient markets. But net-net, it was a slightly down but still positive fourth quarter. And I'd emphasize that because many of our peer group are seeing negative flows. One area where the peer group is seeing negative flows is sovereigns, particularly at central banks and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, which are obviously under severe financial pressure. We have some business in those areas, and we have not seen those outflows yet because we are seeing much stronger investment performance, and we've tended to be among the managers that got retained. We're hopeful that will continue, but obviously there are no guarantees. If I look at the pipeline, which I think was partly where you were going, we have had a very active last 2 months, including over the holidays and in January. And that is unusual. Usually the institutional market globally quiets down during that period, around the end and beginning of the year. But we've seen quote activity and, indeed, fundings looking really quite positive. And I have to say we're feeling pretty optimistic about the flow potential, and that's related to the investment performance that Dan and Terry both mentioned."

As you look at the impact on the fees that occur, it's really more the daily average asset [ph] -- and we use that as a proxy for what the movements in the impact to our account value. So you really look at the average",333,"Yes, you're absolutely right, Yaron. As you look at the impact on the fees that occur, it's really more the daily average asset [ph] -- and we use that as a proxy for what the movements in the impact to our account value. So you really look at the average account value from one period to the next period. Now actual performance of those assets also come into play versus the proxy that we use. Last quarter, we talked about a significant drop point-to-point in the S&P 500. That was down 6.7% third quarter over third quarter. That has an impact on the deferred acquisition costs, and that's what we were referencing the last quarter. Now we have an expectation that you'll have anywhere from a 2% to 3% positive impact in that point-to-point time. So if you look at that 2% to 3% versus, say, down nearly 7%, you're talking a 9% to 10% drop that impacts the deferred acquisition model. Now you go forward to this quarter, now the point-to-point was up 6.5%, as you pointed out. Now that has an impact on the expenses, but the differential between what the expectation and what the actual point-to-point was, was much smaller this quarter and didn't have as significant of an impact. Again, that S&P 500 is a proxy for the movement in our actual assets. The actual asset movement was also impacted by -- the domestic markets were strong in the fourth quarter. However, international markets and maybe some of the fixed income investments weren't quite as strong. But I hope that helps. It's really 2 different things: an average account value and the average S&P go hand in hand, and that typically ties to the fee-base, whereas the expenses associated with the acquisition are more of a point-to-point. Now if you look at the deferred acquisition cost for this quarter, they were right in line with what our expectations would be for every one of our businesses. Hope that helps."

As you talk about variable investment income, there's a lot of components that go into that. What I would talk about in terms of variable investment income is probably prepayment activity that occurs on our mortgages and fixed income investments as well as some real estate sales that we have that also impact that. And typically, I'd look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We benefit from this variable investment income activity by $0.03 to $0.07 a quarter. In 2014, it was well above average because, as you're well aware, everybody was anticipating higher interest rates, and so prepayment activity was really, really high. But we try to call out the variable investment income when it distorts the run rate that is actually in any particular quarter. Now if you look at this particular quarter, this particular quarter, the expectations were right in line with what we would have expected. We saw probably a benefit of variable investment income around $0.04, a little over $0.04. So it's right in line with our expectations. So there was no reason to call it out. Now a year ago, it was slightly higher. And if you actually look out on a run rate basis, we called out probably close to $0.08 -- $0.05 to -- no, probably $0.06 to $0.08 a year ago, which was well above our expectations for the year. But hopefully that helps, but I would expect it to be right in line with expectations this quarter."

And at the moment, we're seeing the problems in credit really associated with the energy companies, the minors, and to an extent, companies with very large leveraged businesses in emerging markets. So it's quite a tight little part of the credit market. The way that, that would become contagion would be if banks have been foolish enough to get overcommitted in those markets. If that happens, you're going to see a broader credit contagion and, indeed, a lower flow of credit in even the U.S. economy. Your question really was what probability do I see attached to that. We've discussed this at some length within our organization. We have people with a lot of different skills on this. But if I can distill it, I would say, in the next 12 months, that's probably a 20% probability. It's still a negative tail risk. It is most likely that the U.S. and global economy continue growing, albeit at a slower pace than it was before. But we need to be ready to defend if contagion happens and you end up with a worse economy. In particular on Brazil, I think what's gone wrong in Brazil, apart from the obvious political process and commodity prices, is, like China, they kept growth going for quite a long time by expansion of credit, particularly to state-owned enterprises for infrastructure investment and so on. That expansion of credit has probably got to about the limit. So you're into a bit of a debt deflation situation. The IMF, I think it was, just brought down their growth estimate or their recession estimate this year to in excess of 3% from 1%. I think that's quite possible. I think you're going to see another year of pretty severe recession in Brazil, come what may. But this is part of a deleveraging process. And we've seen this with economies that slow a lot. Because people are not spending, there's quite a lot of cash available. And Principal International is taking maximum advantage of that right now. This will pass, it's a phase. It could take a while, but it's one where our business can do, frankly, okay."

Total -- so again, total recurring deposits were up 7% year-over-year, that's the billion number that I think Dan mentioned in the script ahead of time. What you may be focused on is the quarter-over-quarter, which was up only about 3.2%. There's some noise there. We have some DB plan deposit noise there. If we strip that noise away and we don't expect that to recur and we look at those core deferrals, so look at the core deferrals and match, that's actually up really strong quarter-over-quarter, closer to 11%, little bit north of 11%. So both with regard to quarter-over-quarter and trailing 12 months, we're seeing very strong growth in those recurring deposits. We're also seeing very strong growth with regard to the number of participants that are deferring. That percentage is up over 8%. So when you look at the fundamentals of this business, whether you're looking at plan count, again we saw that increase across all of the segments, whether you're looking at start-up plans in the industry, we're now seeing start-up plans 17% above pre-crisis level. So still a huge opportunity in that part of the market that is completely underserved because 50% or so of those smaller employers do not, today, have work site access to retirement. We play in that space extremely well and one of the leaders in that start-up plan market. So the underlying fundamentals here are really, really strong. When you look at the fourth quarter lapses, handful of large cases. Again, we're going to win and lose on an M&A basis. We happen to lose a couple where the acquirer of the plan went to the acquirer. The good news there is the momentum we're seeing. I might add one other thing in Q4 that we saw is one plan that came in as a sale, and a very large plan, north of $500 million, is not going to fund until 1Q. So once in a while, as we've mentioned before, we're going to get those timing issues. But if you strip out those timing issues and you look into Q1, we're seeing very significant momentum there, both with regard to our sales pipeline, good momentum in the pipeline, and we're also seeing good momentum with regard to retention. So as we look into 2016, certainly, we don't want to get into the prediction business, but we would anticipate a pretty strong positive net cash flow in Q1, and we would look, as Terry said, to be back in that range of 1% to 3% beginning-of-year account values with regard to net cash flow full year."

So we're going to play there, and we're going to play there in a way that balances growth and profitability."

The other area, I think, about the investment we're making in technology, well beyond cyber security controls, but it gets into having a digital strategy that better enables our customers to do business with us, better support our adviser community, better support our participants, that's an investment we can't afford not to make. And the good news is we can take that same investment and leverage it throughout the organization. So something that works in retirement is something that we'll likely deploy internationally with Luis and his team. And we've also demonstrated we can leverage that across Deanna Strable's U.S. Insurance Solutions. So a good question, we appreciate that, Michael. Did you have a follow-up?"

We know it's top of mind for investors, and we fully appreciate that. I guess, where I start on this question is we've been very active with the trades, we're active with DOL and Congress in better understanding the implications it has as it relates to this fiduciary definition. But from our perspective, job 1 is to protect the interest of the American savers without taking away very valuable education and guidance, which, frankly, most workers are very dependent on. So we've looked at it at basically 3 different inflection points. One is that initial selection of the investments. We think that we've got that appropriately identified and the steps that we'll have to take in order to work with advisers. And so again, we think that that's very manageable. The second is the routine inquiries that we have among our plan participants. They're inquiring about a hardship loan or a standard loan or trying to get some investor education and understand perhaps better the target date investment options. Again, we think that within the definition, there's a way to work with that. We think there's viable solutions. The third is around those job changers, and job changers and retirees. Again, we all know they have 3 options. One is to leave it in the plan. Our reading of the understanding of the rule today would cause perhaps more people to leave it in the plan. There are some benefits from that to the participant. Perhaps fewer investment options, but at the same time, they may very well find that the expenses are lower because it's been aggregated with a large pool of dollars. The second is the rollover IRA, either with Principal or another third party. And then lastly is the cash out, which we think is a bad idea for all the obvious reasons. Again, we'd come back to mapping what that scenario looks like as people are faced with those decisions, and we think there are going to be necessary disclosure and additional steps that will have to be taken. But we've got that fairly well triangulated in terms of the impact. So we know there's more guidance, there's more education, there's more disclosure. We have a large team of people that are hammering away on this issue. We don't think it's a material change to our run rate related to expenses. And like you, we're very anxious about the next 60 to 90 days to see what OMB produces and back to the DOL and what that might start looking like. And I kept that at a fairly high strategic level. But with that as a backdrop, I'll turn it over to Nora to see if she's got any additional color."

We go across all the channels, all the firms. So we're out there. We actually have a very large group, a team that's been working on this for a number of months doing scenario planning and engaging with our third-party distribution partners. And the one result of those discussions is it's pretty clear to us, and again, we're speculating on a preliminary reg here, but it's pretty clear to us that there's going to be an array of adviser business models coming out of this change if and when this reg becomes final. Because between ERISA and this new reg, what you see is a huge amount of optionality. Many exceptions, many exemptions. And so various firms and various advisers and various broker-dealers are going to take different routes, from our perspective. Whether they go the fiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, or the nonfiduciary route with a third-party advisory service, whether they use the best interest contract, there's a lot of optionality. What we're doing is working with them and making sure that we're putting the systems in place to be able to service those diverse operating models across our various channels, firms and advisers. And we feel pretty optimistic that at the end of the day, somebody like us, who's got the scale and the expertise and the discipline to really work channel-by-channel, firm-by-firm, is going to have a really elegant solution to an unbelievably complex set of regulations."

So within that space that we've been talking about, stripping out some of the larger plans, we are -- from a net cash flow perspective, we are proving up that we're extremely competitive. And there are 2 things going on there. One is we've got tremendous investment performance in that target date suite, and we've got a huge lineup with regard to target date, whether you want primarily passive, whether you want primarily active, whether you want it in a funds form or in a CIT form. So between the choice and the investment performance, we are highly competitive in that space.

We had record sales in both group benefits and individual disability, record retention, record premium, record earnings.

I'll then turn the call over to Terry who will provide additional details on financial results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
Principal had a solid start to the year as we continue to focus on meeting the needs of our customers. Our first quarter results were impacted by volatile equity markets, low interest rates and unfavorable currency exchange. Once again, our diversified business model by product, offering, by geography and by asset class helps stabilize earnings and grow assets under management. 
Despite challenging operating conditions, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $1.2 billion of after-tax operating earnings and increased assets under management to a record $548 billion. These results demonstrate our ability to focus on the things within our control, like delivering outcomes-based solutions to customers around the world and maintaining industry-leading margins in a competitive environment. 
Importantly, the fundamentals of business remains strong. As Slide 5 shows, more than 90% of our investment options were on the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 3- and 5-year by basis. Additionally, we received several third-party recognitions for performance in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 6. Barron's Magazine recognized Principal as the sixth best mutual fund manager based on a 5-year period and as a top 5 municipal manager. CIMB-Principal won the award for the best Asia-Pacific Equity Fund at the 2016 Morningstar Awards and won sixth 2016 Edge Lipper Fund Awards, including Best Overall Group. Hong Kong was awarded the MPF Scheme of the Year at 2016 MPF Awards. Mexico was awarded the Best Balanced Fund in 2015 by Morningstar. 
Outstanding investment performance, coupled with our broad multi-channel distribution network, enable us to generate more than $3 billion in total company net cash flows for the quarter and $17 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, while many in the industry experienced outflows. The Retirement and Income Solutions Fee business had $3 billion of quarterly net cash flows due to strong sales and planned level retention in the quarter. Principal Global Investors had a single large, passively managed currency overlay mandate laps in the first quarter. Equity and fixed income net cash flows were $3 billion in total as our distinctive active strategies and outcome-based solutions continue to resonate with investors. And Principal International had its 30th consecutive quarter of positive reported net cash flows. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to strengthen our competitive position. I'll start with a comment on our global brand launch, followed by ways we're enhancing our solution sets, expanding distributions and improving customer outcomes. One of the more notable achievement for the quarter was the roll out of our refresh global brand. Our new brand better represents how we help people in all life stages achieve financial success. The brand underscores our commitment to the underserved markets, including small and medium-size businesses in the U.S. and emerging markets with growing middle-class populations in Latin America and Asia. And it reflects our intensified focus on make it easier for everyone, individuals, business owners, , and institutional clients to do business with us. 
In March, we planted another important seed in Asia. We signed a memorandum of understanding with China Construction Bank, the second largest bank in the world, to develop a new asset management and pension partnership. Principal and China Construction Bank jointly created CCB-Principal Asset Management company in 2005, and it has become a leading fund management company in China. This new agreement enhances our existing long-term successful relationship, and is a key to creating future opportunities for Principal to participate in a significant pension asset management opportunities in China. 
Also in the quarter, we purchased the remaining stake in Claritas. With the leading asset manager in Brazil, we are well positioned to capture the growing opportunity as investors seek to diversify their portfolio by geography and asset class. Claritas also provides a mutual fund distribution platform in Brazil for several funds managed by Principal Global Investors, further expanding the synergies of our business. Despite political and economic volatility, Brazil continues to generate positive cash flows and remains a very important market for us with an excellent long-term growth opportunities. 
Moving to our solution set. We further expanded our investment and distribution platform in the first quarter, launching 2 new ETFs: The price setters index ETF and the shareholder yield Index ETF. Our target date collective investment trust, or CITs, are gaining significant traction in the retirement space, including the Defined Contribution Investment Only channel due to strong investment performance. At the end of the first quarter, 8 out of 12 of the funds in our target date CIT series were in the top decile on a 3- and 5-year basis. The demand for our target date investment options remain high among retirement plan clients as we provide broad diversified choices with our multi-manager options, including both active and passive strategies. 
In addition to expanding our investment platform, we continue to invest in innovative customer solutions to drive further growth. Following our examples of recent initiatives to help people get on the path to financial security and improve customer outcomes. We recently launched Principal Pension Builder, which gives participants the opportunity to purchase and in-plan annuity, give them easy access to guaranteed income through the retirement. We continue our efforts to aggressively promote PlanWorks, our suite of best-in-class plan designs that include features like automatic enrollment and automatic deferral increases. These plan designs resulted higher participation and higher savings rates versus traditional opt-in plan designs. 
Additionally, we recently introduced My Virtual Coach, which is driving outcomes as well. This innovative virtual existed interactive enrollment and education tool makes it easier than ever for 401(k) plan participants to save for retirement, and appeals to a new generation of investors. 
On the protection side, we're also using technology to improve the customer experience when buying life and disability insurance.

Turning to Slide 7, I'll close with comments on the final fiduciary rule released by the Department of Labor on April 6.  Though we're still fairly reviewing the nearly 1,000 page document, I have some overall comments to me. As we've said before, we remain concerned that some individuals will receive less help in the future than they do today. That said, we remain hopeful we can work with the Department of Labor towards the end goal of helping Americans adequately prepare for retirement. Implementation is clearly top of mind, and we continue to work with the industry and distribution firms to clarify this complex rule and design responsive business models to serve clients regardless of size. There will certainly be transition costs and higher ongoing compliance cost, but we don't expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. Importantly, based on our review of the final rule, we'll still be able to help small businesses with their retirement plans, and our affiliated distribution channels will still be able to sell proprietary products. We'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and by providing a diversified portfolio of in planned offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. Despite the challenges, we believe we'll continue to gain market share as distribution firms potentially limit who they work with to a smaller number of providers that can help manage and comply with the revised rules.  We'll also gain market share as we accelerate growth of our defined contribution investment-only business and experience higher retention rates of retirees. 
In closing, I remain optimistic about the remainder of 2016 and beyond. The fundamentals of the business are strong, and we'll continue to strengthen our competitive position despite an operating environment that remains challenging. Terry?"
201105,313906463,967326,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan.

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
As Dan said, we viewed first quarter results as a solid start to 2016. Despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we see the strength of the underlying fundamentals of our business and signs of some headwinds experience for some time might be weakening. 
Total company after-tax operating earnings for the first quarter were $286 million, a 12% decline versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a continued volatile operating environment. An important proxy for our fee revenue is the S&P 500 daily average, which was down approximately 5% compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. This negatively impacted the daily average revenue from our fee businesses, the primary driver of earnings. This is the first time since third quarter of 2009 that the S&P 500 daily average declined compared to the prior year period. Additionally, foreign currency translation negatively impacted current quarter earnings compared to the prior year quarter. Operating earnings are translated using the average currency exchange rates. However, for the first time since second quarter 2014, the U.S. dollar spot rate weakened versus all 3 of our Latin American currencies during the quarter. This was a benefit to assets under management as foreign-exchange for assets under management is translated on a spot rate basis. 
Over the long term, we continue to align revenue and expense growth to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. Expense initiatives started in the first quarter will benefit earnings in the second quarter of the year and beyond. 
As shown on Slide 8, reported earnings per share were $0.97 for the first quarter 2016, an 8% decline compared to the normalized year-ago quarter, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate and volatile equity markets. At the end of the first quarter, return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment, was 13.4%. The 160 basis point decline from first quarter 2015 is predominantly due to the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lower prepayment fees. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results starting on Slide 9 with Retirement and Income Solutions, or RISP businesses. First quarter pretax operating earnings of $114 million were down 17% from the normalized year-ago quarter. Quarterly net revenue decreased 6% from the prior year normalized quarter driven by unfavorable equity market conditions. On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 30%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, pretax return on net revenue was 32%. Given normal market conditions, we are confident our industry-leading margin will continue to be within our previously stated range of 28% to 32% throughout 2016. RISP had strong net free cash flow $3 billion in the first quarter. For full year 2016, we still expect net cash flow to be on the stated 1% to 3% range as we continue to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. 
The balance of strong sales and retention, combined with expected equity market returns and continued expense alignment, should drive a stronger finish to 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. RIS spread quarterly pretax operating earnings was $67 million, a 10% increase over the year-ago quarter. The rise in earnings, which is in line with the 10% growth in the RIS spread average account values, was driven by strong sales of all spread products. On a trailing 12-month basis, the normalized pretax return on net revenue was 55%, and within our guided range. RIS-Spread continues to perform well as the market volatility has created opportunities as clients welcome guaranteed solutions even in the low interest rate environment. The pipeline remains strong, and we continue to approach the pension closeout and investment-only businesses opportunistically. 
Turning to Slide 11. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $80 million in the first quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by volatile market performance as well as lower performance and transaction fees in the first quarter 2016. The low performance and transaction fees in the first quarter were a result of a timing differences as we see good visibility for more normal levels in the remainder of 2016. While these performance and transaction fees fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the best measure of our ongoing development in asset management is management fees. These increased slightly from a year ago quarter, and increased more than 6% on a trailing 12-month basis in spite of the severe industry headwinds. On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 33% and within our expected range. Quarterly net cash flows were a positive $700 million despite the lapse of a $3.3 billion passively managed low fee currency overlay mandate. The new business pipeline remains strong. 
Slide 12 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $68 million. On a constant-currency basis, and adjusting for encaje performance, Principal International continues to have mid-teens growth in operating earnings. First quarter of 2016 encaje performance was $4 million pretax lower than expected, while the year-ago quarter benefited $5 million pretax from better-than-expected encaje performance. 
We're continuing to build traction in China. Quarterly pretax operating earnings in China more than tripled over the prior year quarter, providing further diversification within Principal International. We continue to work with our joint venture partner, China Construction Bank, to diversify product portfolio and provide investment solutions for long-term savings. Compared to the prior year quarter, the strength in the U.S. dollars [indiscernible] Principal International pretax operating earnings by $16 million. Over the trailing 12 months, foreign-exchange has reduced Principal International assets under management by $9 billion. However, strengthening Latin American currencies in the latter part of the first quarter 2016 had a favorable $8 billion impact on assets under management in the quarter. If sustained, this improved exchange rate could provide a tailwind to the next quarter's operating earnings. 
Moving to Slide 13. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $39 million. First quarter 2015 was positively impacted by the recovery of reinsurance premiums partially offset by higher expenses. After normalizing prior year results, pretax operating earnings decreased 5%. Growth in the block of business was offset by higher individual disability claims compared to the prior year period, which can be volatile in any one quarter. The overall loss ratio for the first quarter was within the targeted range. The underlying fundamentals of the business remains strong with record sales and retention and normalized premium and fee growth of 8% as well as double-digit increase in trailing 12-month pretax operating earnings. As a reminder, Specialty Benefits operating earnings are seasonally impacted by higher first quarter dental and vision claims and higher first quarter non-deferred sales-related expenses. Typically, distribution of annual earnings in this business is 20% in the first quarter, 25% in the second and third quarters and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 14, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% from the prior year period. This was a strong result, leading to pretax margin of 16%, which is at the higher end of our range. Results this quarter were driven by higher interest margins as well as favorable mortality on a growing block of business. Business market sales remain strong at 56% of total sales in the first quarter. Corporate pretax operating losses of $53 million were lower than expected due to timing of some of our funded initiatives. We anticipate full year 2016 corporate pretax operating losses to be at the lower end of our previously announced range of $235 million to $265 million. For the quarter, total company net income was $368 million, including net realized capital gains of $82 million. Lower interest rates led to gains of $112 million in our derivative portfolio, partially offset by $30 million of credit-related losses. Our investment portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations as credit stress was isolated to the energy and basic industry sectors. We remain confident in our diversified high-quality investment portfolio. Again, due to our disciplined asset/liability management, we are not forced sellers in stressed times. 
As outlined on Slide 15, we continue to target $800 million to $1 billion of capital deployment in 2016. In first quarter 2016, we paid a $0.38 common stock dividend, a strong dividend yield in the current low interest rate environment.  Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.39 per share, payable in the second quarter, as we continue to increase our dividend payout ratio. In addition, we repurchased $86 million worth of common stock in the first quarter, completing the remainder of our 2015 authorization. In February, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $400 million share repurchase program. $389 million of that authorization remained outstanding at the end of the first quarter. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital deployment and consider all options, including dividends, acquisitions, share repurchase and reducing our leverage ratio. In the current environment, we view share repurchase as an effective way to increase long-term value for shareholders. Despite the volatile operating environment, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we will continue to focus on things within our control to drive growth and profitability for the long term. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

You'll have seen from Page 3 of the supplement that management fee revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, we show that other thing called other revenue. The 2 biggest parts of other revenue are borrower fees on commercial mortgage origination and incentive fees on various strategies from hedge funds to real estate funds to various institutional accounts that have an incentive fee. So those are shown in other revenues. And you'll see, if you look back at the trailing 12 months, that's been, typically, give or take, 20% to 25% of our total revenues of PGI. It's been pretty steady. What's happened during the first quarter is that borrowers on commercial mortgages delayed closing because of markets instability. And it so happened, this is partly random actually, that the incentive fees were actually basically 0 in the first quarter. Now the incentive fees can be on a 1-year cycle, a 3-year cycle or be dependent on the realization of the underlying asset. Those are really the 3 way they tend to operate. And most quarters, we get some. As you know, back-end loaded to the fourth quarter, which is partly trailing 12-months in the supplement. So this preamble is really a buildup to a couple of numbers I can give you, if I can identify them here in my notes. If you look at the quarter, the year-ago quarter, just for example, was a typical 20% other revenue quarter. We had $264.2 million of management fees and $64.7 million of other revenue. The quarter just ended that we're reporting on has $265.4 million of management fees. So actually, up slightly on a year ago quarter, but only $44.2 million of other revenue as all the phenomena I mentioned were slowing client activities. We have done a pretty thorough bottom-up analysis of what other revenues will look like during the rest of the year, and we are basically anticipating that the year will be much more typical over the last 2 or 3 years, and that really what has happened is a little bit random, but more important, the client activities will pick up again. So we remain pretty perky about what the year as a whole will look like."

We're pretty confident that the 33% to 36% range that we mentioned for return on that revenue in the guidance call in December, that remains a pretty good guide to how we look for the year on all current indications. In terms of investment for growth. As you know, we are one of the few global asset managers who is actually growing revenues at the moment. There's a lot of other vicious industry headwinds. Their volumes and new business were taking on a definitely leading to elevated cost. Both the cost of taking the business on in terms of commissions and setup expenses, but also developing our sales force and our ability to serve clients, whether it's different -- whether it's new classes and mutual funds, our new offices internationally those are all expansionary things we're doing, but they're all costing money. And that's why 33% to 36% remains our guidance, not higher. There are asset managers with higher margins, there's a few, but they're mostly firms who are not growing or even in some cases, shrinking.

As we've talked about in the past, we look at the relationship between our growth and our revenue and our growth in our expenses. We always tried to have this 1% to 2% differential, i.e., the revenue growing faster than expenses. But when you look back to 2014, as part of the trailing 12 months, and as always, we try to look at it over a longer period of time because of some volatility that could occur in any one particularly period, 2014 was a pretty tough comparison because of the strong revenue growth as well as expenses that we had. So looking at it in terms of more of a sequential basis, you've seen that pretty significant reduction in our expense growth from fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. It's down approximately 5% or $44 million. Now we think that as you go forward, we're going to continue to align our expenses and revenue. And as Jim talked about, he's looking to the future of PGI. We also look across all of our organization, and we feel more comfortable about the growth rate for the entire year. If you look at 2016 compared to 2015, we'll see that 1% differential on our revenue growth. We think that 2015 is probably a more comparable year. And if you look at expenses in the first quarter of 2016, I'd say that, that's probably more comparable with what you'll see the rest of the year than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. So again, again, we look at the growth rate of expenses and sure, and try to make sure that we get that good comparison with the growth rate of revenues. In any point particular quarter, it's tough to do. As you saw in the first quarter, a significant decline in the equity markets having an impact on our revenue, on a short-term basis. Our expenses will catch-up with that -- with the rest of the year. Hope that helps."

There's $22 trillion in this country, which arguably, would make it the most successful retirement system anywhere in the world. Secondly, the DOL, I believe their intentions are good. I think about the intent of the laws is to protect the interest of the U.S. retirement savers, it's about creating transparency around cost and benefits and value. It's also about making sure we have access to the competitive marketplace. There are some unintended consequences, and that's what Dan will respond to in just a minute relative to working with advisers. There's a view that the Robo solutions don’t solve problems for small account balance holders. That's just not the case, and so we have some more work to do there. The second is we want to make sure that we're not creating barriers or reduce the number of advisers that have in the past and will in the future, provide important education to individuals and to savers. And then we also want to make sure that we don't limit the number of individualized solutions that we can present to plan participants. They're very dependent on that enroller, if you will.

In fact, the majority of that systems revenue comes from transaction that are not impacted by the proposal. Having said that, I think there's a couple of points that I think is important to keep in mind as we think about even those products that do fall under the regulation. First of all, as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, the final regs did allow for a pass forward on proprietary products, and that applies to both funds within our retirement plan as well as retail products sold at the time of either retirement or when participants change jobs. I think the other thing to keep in mind is our affiliated advisers already today have a choice. We have both proprietary and non-proprietary products and solutions. And our proprietary offerings will have to continue to compete on items such as investment performance and service as they do today. So we will have some business model changes for that channel, that will come in the realm of compensation changes, like you mentioned, compliance.

We're looking for that what will enhance the shareholder's value. No buying back shares is one of the options. But we look at all kinds of different things in terms of -- to enhance shareholder value as well as to distribute that value as it's created. If you look at over the last several years, you'd see we've done a pretty good job of balancing it between our organic growth and acquisitions in order to create shareholder value and then increasing our dividend payout ratio as we just increased the dividend again, as we marched towards that 40% of net income. And buyback is just another part of the program here. And so we talked about, in 2016, $800 million to $1 billion. And we're on track to do that. And we think that as you mentioned though, that the share buyback program is a very important part of that so far. So to the first quarter, we have $86 million. As of yesterday, we added another $26 million in the program. So we're over $100 million now. We're looking at it over a long term, we do have a program that gets accelerated as the share price goes lower. Hopefully, we don’t have to worry about that in the near future. But as we look into the second half of the year, we've got options. We've got opportunities to continue to pay out our dividend and increase it towards that 40% payout ratio. We're also looking at acquisition activity for the remainder of the year. And as we've talked about in the past, we looked at increasing our share of some PGI boutiques, and so we'll look at that as well. We'll also think about the share buyback. So as I've mentioned, we've continued to build that out. So we got over $360 [ph] million yet in our authorization. So that is a very integral part of the share buyback -- excuse me, of the capital deployment strategy this environment. And then we'll also continue to look at opportunities to capital structure and reduce our debt and reduce our debt leverage because we do have some high coupon debt out there that we could -- if the opportunity presents itself, use that for that. So we're going to continue very balanced, disciplined, long-term approach to our capital deployment strategy. And I think we're well on our way to distributing that $800 million to $1 billion. Hope that helps."

With the kind of plan retention we're seeing, with the kind of the sales we're seeing, we're always looking -- obviously we've got a competitive market we're dealing in. But one of the things that we're seeing is, in particular, in that small to medium, that core segment of our market, we're seeing just a tremendous opportunity for us as we move in that space. And what we've seen is as we look at that growth in our -- both in our sales and retention, that, that's the piece of it that is really outperforming for us. The lumpiness that we talked about, the volatility we talked about comes when 1 or 2 larger cases. So you think in terms of $500 million or north of $500 million. Now oftentimes, when we talk about the discipline between growth and profitability, it's with those larger cases in making a decision that we're not willing to race to the bottom on pricing. So that's the kind of lumpiness you'll see, and that's why we'll have quarters like we had this quarter with the $3 billion really outstanding net cash flow, but we don't want to get over our skis and extrapolating that because we will have 1 or 2 large plan decisions over the year that will move that number, which is why we continue to reaffirm the guidance that if we look at a full year rather than a quarter-to-quarter, if we look at the full year, we're confident given what we see today that we're going to be well within that 1% to 3% of beginning of the year account value. But the caveat that we always throw out is because our core business is small and medium businesses, when you have 1 or 2 of those larger cases moving in or out, that can swing the numbers, which is why we tend to look full year rather than quarter-to-quarter."

So that again, as a differentiator, frozen Defined Benefit, deferred compensations, ESOP had a nice quarter here. So that is a nice differentiator. The other point I'd make is, because this generalization of large case pricing. There are so many components that go into the pricing of a large plan. How many payroll centers? What is the current penetration rate relative to participant involvement? What's the customized communications packages? All of those variables go into that. So when we lose a plan or win a plan, it's because we've done the homework behind the scenes to understand exactly what kind of resources are going to have to be deployed against that plan. So that's why at any given time, you could lose a plan or win a plan. But again, we like the model that we have. We think it resonates in the marketplace, and our retention rate would imply that those large plans appreciate it. Hopefully that helps."

I think what it's going to cause is at the inflection point of a job changer or a retiree, they're going to call into a call center like they always have, because that's the typical sort of process. And they're going to be having a conversation with a person providing education and guidance. And they're going to disclose what the pricing is in the current plan structure, in a qualified retirement plan. It could be larger plan. And there's going to be a certain price. And they're also, as they always have in the past, disclosed to them that there are other options for them to consider. They could move that money to a rollover IRA with a Principal, or they could roll over that money to a third-party. And the names are common. You would know all of those. And the burden that now falls on the adviser is that the participant has a very clear understanding that they're moving from one product to another. And they have to look at it on a couple of different dimensions. One dimension, of course, is the investment lineup. Is it the same, or is it different? Another dimension is what's the underlying performance of those investment options? The third dimension is on the price. What am I paying and what am I getting in exchange for that? And it doesn't have to be the same price, but there has to be a thorough understanding and explanation on why there is a difference for the price being paid. That action onto itself is going to take a longer conversation for fully betting that opportunity. It ties it back to my earlier statements that small account balance holders could find that there are fewer advisers willing to invest the time and the energy to vet every one of those situations. So I think there is a likelihood that 401(k) service providers could end up almost, by default, retaining maybe more of those smaller account balances after they've had that discussion with that phone counselor. I think on the larger account balances, there are advisers that are going to be spending the time to help get the opportunity. And the last comment I would make is, remember that we are a significant player in the rollover business for Defined Contribution Investment Only, where Jim Coggins PGI investment products not only find themselves on the platform of many 401(k) chassis but also they find themselves on rollover IRA chassis, and again, with strong performance and investment options and sold needs for long-term savers, I think that's a net plus.

It seemed to me that we're able to saw that rock bottom -- solid rock bottom cycle of the emerging market, very much more around January. If you're looking to equity FX, confidence indexes and commodity prices, even interest rates are showing a much better picture for emerging markets today.

So what happened with our net customer cash flow, you could see our financial supplement, trailing 12 months, we are [indiscernible] in at $9.3 billion in trailing 12 months. We put in $900 million net customer cash flow in the first quarter. If you're looking the plan that we have had during 2015, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, in the first part of the year, average per quarter $2.5 billion, $3 billion in net customer cash flows, average in the second part of the year, $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion, and then we had $1 billion. But if you're going into the first quarter, I would say that January, February, March, they had a very positive,  I would say, behavior. February was a pretty much more flat, better February and much better March. So I would say that the $900 million that we do have in first quarter is not an indication of what is our real run rate that we are looking forward during 2016."

I'll then turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on financial results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
Principal had a solid start to the year as we continue to focus on meeting the needs of our customers. Our first quarter results were impacted by volatile equity markets, low interest rates and unfavorable currency exchange. Once again, our diversified business model by product offering, by geography and by asset class helped stabilize earnings and grow assets under management. 
Despite challenging operating conditions, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $1.2 billion of after-tax operating earnings and increased assets under management to a record $548 billion. These results demonstrate our ability to focus on the things within our control, like delivering outcomes-based solutions to customers around the world and maintaining industry-leading margins in a competitive environment. 
Importantly, the fundamentals of business remains strong. As Slide 5 shows, more than 90% of our investment options were on the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 3- and 5-year by basis. 
Additionally, we received several third-party recognitions for performance in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 6. Barron's Magazine recognized Principal as the sixth best mutual fund manager based on a 5-year period and as a top 5 municipal manager. CIMB-Principal won the award for the best Asia-Pacific Equity Fund at the 2016 Morningstar Awards and won 6 2016 Edge Lipper Fund Awards, including Best Overall Group. Hong Kong was awarded the MPF Scheme of the Year in 2016 MPF Awards. Mexico was awarded the best balanced fund in 2015 by Morningstar. 
Outstanding investment performance coupled with our broad multi-channel distribution network enable us to generate more than $3 billion in total company net cash flows for the quarter and $17 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, while many in the industry experienced outflows. The Retirement and Income Solution - Fee business had $3 billion of quarterly net cash flows due to strong sales and plan-level retention in the quarter. 
Principal Global Investors had a single large, passively managed currency overlay mandate lapse in the first quarter. Equity and fixed income net cash flows were $3 billion in total as our distinctive active strategies and outcome-based solutions continue to resonate with investors. And Principal International had its 30th consecutive quarter of positive reported net cash flows. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to strengthen our competitive position. I'll start with a comment on our global brand launch, followed by ways we're enhancing our solution set, expanding distribution and improving customer outcomes. 
One of the more notable achievements for the quarter was the roll out of our refresh global brand. Our new brand better represents how we help people in all life stages achieve financial success. The brand underscores our commitment to the underserved markets, including small and medium-size businesses in the U.S. and emerging markets, with growing middle-class populations in Latin America and Asia, and it reflects our intensified focus on make it easier for everyone, individuals, business owners, advisors and institutional clients to do business with us. 
In March, we planted another important seed in Asia. We signed a memorandum of understanding with China Construction Bank, the second largest bank in the world, to develop a new asset management and pension partnership. Principal and China Construction Bank jointly created CCB-Principal Asset Management company in 2005, and it has become a leading fund management company in China. This new agreement enhances our existing long-term successful relationship and is a key to creating future opportunities for Principal to participate in a significant pension and asset management opportunities in China. 
Also in the quarter, we purchased the remaining stake in Claritas. With a leading asset manager in Brazil, we are well positioned to capture the growing opportunity as investors seek to diversify their portfolio by geography and asset class. Claritas also provides a mutual fund distribution platform in Brazil for several funds managed by Principal Global Investors, further expanding the synergies of our business. Despite political and economic volatility, Brazil continues to generate positive cash flows and remains a very important market for us with excellent long-term growth opportunities. 
Moving to our solution set. We further expanded our investment and distribution platform in the first quarter, launching 2 new ETFs: the Price Setters Index ETF and the Shareholder Yield Index ETF. Our target-date collective investment trust, or CITs, are gaining significant traction in the retirement space, including the Defined Contribution Investment Only channel, due to strong investment performance. At the end of the first quarter, 8 out of 12 of the funds in our target-date CIT series were in the top decile on a 3- and 5-year basis. The demand for our target-date investment options remain high among retirement plan clients as we provide broad diversified choices with our multi-manager options, including both active and passive strategies. 
In addition to expanding our investment platform, we continue to invest in innovative customer solutions to drive further growth. Following our examples of recent initiatives to help people get on the path to financial security and improve customer outcomes, we recently launched Principal Pension Builder, which gives participants the opportunity to purchase an in-plan annuity, give them easy access to guaranteed income through their retirement. We continue our efforts to aggressively promote PlanWorks, our suite of best-in-class plan designs that include features like automatic enrollment and automatic deferral increases. These plan designs are resulting higher participation and higher savings rates versus traditional opt-in plan designs. 
Additionally, we recently introduced My Virtual Coach, which is driving outcomes as well. This innovative virtual-assisted interactive enrollment and education tool makes it easier than ever for 401(k) plan participants to save for retirement and appeals to a new generation of investors. 
On the protection side, we're also using technology to improve the customer experience when buying life and disability insurance. Recently, we launched the first phase of a digital sales solution for these products on principal.com. The solution delivers tools to help potential customers assess their coverage needs, get a price quote and obtain assistance to complete the process. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll close with comments on the final fiduciary rule released by the Department of Labor on April 6.  Though we're still thoroughly reviewing the nearly 1,000-page document, I have some overall comments to make. As we've said before, we remain concerned that some individuals will receive less help in the future than they do today. That said, we remain hopeful we can work with the Department of Labor towards the end goal of helping Americans adequately prepare for retirement. Implementation is clearly top of mind, and we continue to work with the industry and distribution firms to clarify this complex rule and design responsive business models to serve clients regardless of size. There will certainly be transition cost and higher ongoing compliance cost, but we don't expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. Importantly, based on our review of the final rule, we'll still be able to help small businesses with their retirement plans, and our affiliated distribution channels will still be able to sell proprietary products. 
We'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and by providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Despite the challenges, we believe we'll continue to gain market share as distribution firms potentially limit who they work with to a smaller number of providers that can help them manage and comply with the revised rules.  We'll also gain market share as we accelerate growth of our Defined Contribution Investment Only business and experience higher retention rates of retirees. 
In closing, I remain optimistic about the remainder of 2016 and beyond. The fundamentals of the business are strong, and we'll continue to strengthen our competitive position despite an operating environment that remains challenging. Terry?"
201105,313906463,967616,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan.

As Dan said, we viewed first quarter results as",1580,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
As Dan said, we viewed first quarter results as a solid start to 2016. Despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we see the strength of the underlying fundamentals of our business and signs that some headwinds experienced for some time might be weakening. 
Total company after-tax operating earnings for the first quarter were $286 million, a 12% decline versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a continued volatile operating environment. An important proxy for our fee revenue is the S&P 500 daily average, which was down approximately 5% compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. This negatively impacted the daily average revenue from our fee businesses, the primary driver of earnings. This is the first time since third quarter of 2009 that the S&P 500 daily average declined compared to the prior year period. 
Additionally, foreign currency translation negatively impacted current quarter earnings compared to the prior year quarter. Operating earnings are translated using the average currency exchange rates. However, for the first time since second quarter 2014, the U.S. dollar spot rate weakened versus all 3 of our Latin American currencies during the quarter. This was a benefit to assets under management as foreign exchange for assets under management is translated on a spot rate basis. 
Over the long term, we continue to align revenue and expense growth to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. Expense initiatives started in the first quarter will benefit earnings in the second half of the year and beyond. 
As shown on Slide 8, reported earnings per share were $0.97 for first quarter 2016, an 8% decline compared to the normalized year ago quarter, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate and volatile equity markets. 
At the end of the first quarter, return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment, was 13.4%. The 160 basis point decline from first quarter 2015 is predominantly due to the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lower prepayment fees. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results starting on Slide 9 with Retirement Income Solutions, or RIS - Fee, businesses. First quarter pretax operating earnings of $114 million were down 17% from the normalized year ago quarter. Quarterly net revenue decreased 6% from the prior year normalized quarter, driven by unfavorable equity market conditions. On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 30%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, pretax return on net revenue was 32%. Given normal market conditions, we are confident our industry-leading margin will continue to be within our previously stated range of 28% to 32% throughout 2016. RIS - Fee had strong net free cash flow $3 billion in the first quarter. For full year 2016, we still expect net cash flow to be on our stated 1% to 3% range as we continue to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. The balance of strong sales and retention, combined with expected equity market returns and continued expense alignment, should drive a stronger finish to 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. RIS - Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings was $67 million, a 10% increase over the year ago quarter. The rise in earnings, which is in line with the 10% growth in the RIS - Spread average account values, was driven by strong sales of all spread products. On a trailing 12-month basis, the normalized pretax return on net revenue was 55% and within our guided range. RIS-Spread continues to perform well as the market volatility has created opportunities as clients welcome guaranteed solutions even in the low interest rate environment. The pipeline remains strong, and we continue to approach the pension closeout and Investment Only businesses opportunistically. 
Turning to Slide 11. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $80 million in the first quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by volatile market performance as well as lower performance and transaction fees in first quarter 2016. The low performance and transaction fees in the first quarter were a result of timing differences as we see good visibility for more normal levels in the remainder of 2016. 
While these performance and transactions fees fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the best measure of our ongoing development in asset management is management fees. These increased slightly from a year ago quarter and increased more than 6% on a trailing 12-month basis in spite of the severe industry headwinds. On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 33% and within our expected range. 
Quarterly net cash flows were a positive $700 million despite the lapse of a $3.3 billion passively managed low-fee currency overlay mandate. The new business pipeline remains strong. 
Slide 12 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $68 million. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for encaje performance, Principal International continues to have mid-teens growth in operating earnings. First quarter 2016 encaje performance was $4 million pretax lower than expected, while the year ago quarter benefited $5 million pretax from better-than-expected encaje performance. 
We're continuing to build traction in China. Quarterly pretax operating earnings in China more than tripled over the prior year quarter providing further diversification within Principal International. 
We continue to work with our joint venture partner, China Construction Bank, to develop a diversified product portfolio and provide investment solutions for long-term savings. Compared to the prior year quarter, the strengthening U.S. dollars suppressed Principal International pretax operating earnings by $16 million. Over the trailing 12 months, foreign exchange has reduced Principal International assets under management by $9 billion. However, strengthening Latin American currencies in the latter part of the first quarter 2016 had a favorable $8 billion impact on assets under management in the quarter. If sustained, this improved exchange rate could provide a tailwind to next quarter's operating earnings. 
Moving to Slide 13. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $39 million. First quarter 2015 was positively impacted by the recovery of reinsurance premiums partially offset by higher expenses. After normalizing prior year results, pretax operating earnings decreased 5%. Growth in the block of business was offset by higher individual disability claims compared to the prior period, which can be volatile in any one quarter. The overall loss ratio for the first quarter was within the targeted range. 
The underlying fundamentals of the business remains strong with record sales and retention and normalized premium and fee growth of 8% as well as double-digit increase in trailing 12-month pretax operating earnings. As a reminder, Specialty Benefits operating earnings are seasonally impacted by higher first quarter dental and vision claims and higher first quarter nondeferred sales-related expenses. Typically, distribution of annual earnings in this business is 20% in the first quarter, 25% in the second and third quarters and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 14, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% from the prior year period. This was a strong result, leading to pretax margin of 16%, which is at the higher end of our range. Results this quarter were driven by higher interest margins as well as favorable mortality on a growing block of business.  Business market sales remain strong at 56% of total sales in the first quarter. 
Corporate pretax operating losses of $53 million were lower than expected due to timing of some of our funded initiatives. We anticipate full year 2016 corporate pretax operating losses to be at the lower end of our previously announced range of $235 million to $265 million. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $368 million, including net realized capital gains of $82 million. Lower interest rates led to gains of $112 million in our derivative portfolio, partially offset by $30 million of credit-related losses. Our investment portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations as credit stress was isolated to the energy and basic industry sectors. We remain confident in our diversified high-quality investment portfolio. Again, due to our disciplined asset liability management, we are not forced sellers in stressed times. 
As outlined on Slide 15, we continue to target $800 million to $1 billion of capital deployment in 2016. In first quarter 2016, we paid a $0.38 common stock dividend, a strong dividend yield in the current low interest rate environment.  Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.39 per share payable in the second quarter, as we continue to increase our dividend payout ratio. 
In addition, we repurchased $86 million worth of common stock in the first quarter, completing the remainder of our 2015 authorization. In February, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $400 million share repurchase program. $389 million of that authorization remained outstanding at the end of the first quarter. 
We continue to have a balanced approach to capital deployment and consider all options, including dividends, acquisitions, share repurchase and reducing our leverage ratio. 
In the current environment, we view share repurchase as an effective way to increase long-term value for shareholders. Despite the volatile operating environment, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we will continue to focus on things within our control to drive growth and profitability for the long term. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

You'll have seen from Page 3 of the supplement that management fee revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, we show that, and this thing called other revenue.

You'll have seen from Page 3 of the supplement that management fee revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, we show that, and this thing called other revenue. The 2 biggest parts of other revenue are borrower fees on commercial mortgage origination and incentive fees on various strategies from hedge funds to real estate funds to various institutional accounts that have an incentive fee. So those are shown in other revenues. And you'll see, if you look back at the trailing 12 months, that's been typically, give or take, 20% to 25% of our total revenues of PGI. It's been pretty steady. What's happened during the first quarter is that borrowers on commercial mortgages delayed closing because of markets instability. And it so happened, this is partly random actually, that the incentive fees were actually basically 0 in the first quarter. Now the incentive fees can be on a 1-year cycle, a 3-year cycle or be dependent on the realization of the underlying asset. Those are really the 3 ways they tend to operate, and most quarters, we get some. They're, as you know, back-end loaded to the fourth quarter, which is partly why we showed trailing 12-months in the supplement. So this preamble is really a buildup to a couple of numbers I can give you, if I can identify them here in my notes. If you look at the quarter, the year ago quarter, just for example, was a typical 20% other revenue quarter. We had $264.2 million of management fees and $64.7 million of other revenue. The quarter just ended that we're reporting on had $265.4 million of management fees. So actually, up slightly on a year ago quarter, but only $44.2 million of other revenue, as all the phenomena I mentioned were slowing client activities. We have done a pretty thorough bottom-up analysis of what other revenues will look like during the rest of the year, and we are basically anticipating that the year will be much more typical over the last 2 or 3 years and that really what has happened is a little bit random, but more important, the client activities will pick up again. So we remain pretty perky about what the year as a whole will look like."

The slight depression of margins taking the first quarter on its own was simply due to a relatively low -- an anomalously lower revenues for the reasons I described. We're pretty confident that the 33% to 36% range that we mentioned for return on that revenue in the guidance call in December, that remains a pretty good guide to how we'll look for the year on all current indications. In terms of investment for growth. As you know, we're one of the few global asset managers who's actually growing revenues at the moment. There's a lot of rather vicious industry headwinds. The volumes in new business we're taking on are definitely leading to elevated costs. Both the costs of taking the business on in terms of commission and setup expenses, but also developing our sales force and our ability to serve clients, whether it's different -- whether it's new share class of the mutual funds or new offices internationally, those are all expansionary things we're doing, but they're all costing money. And that's why 33% to 36% remains our guidance, not higher. There are asset managers with higher margins, there's a few, but they're mostly firms who are not growing or even in some cases shrinking. I would rather have our balance, but hope that answers the question, Erik."

As we've talked about in the past, we look at the relationship between our growth and our revenue and our growth and our expenses. We always tried to have this 1% to 2% differential, i.e., the revenue growing faster than expenses. But when you look back to 2014, as part of the trailing 12 months, and as always, we try to look at it over a longer period of time because of some volatility that could occur in any one particular period, 2014 was a pretty tough comparison because of the strong revenue growth as well as the expenses that we had. So looking at it in terms of more of a sequential basis, you've seen a pretty significant reduction in our expense growth from fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. It's down approximately 5% or $44 million. Now we think that as you go forward, we're going to continue to align our expenses and revenue. And as Jim talked about, he's looking to the future of PGI. We also look across all of our organizations, and we feel more comfortable about the growth rate for the entire year. If you look at 2016 compared to 2015, we'll see that 1% differential on our revenue growth. We think that 2015 is probably a more comparable year. And if you look at expenses in the first quarter of 2016, I'd say that, that's probably more comparable with what you'll see the rest of the year than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. So again, we look at the growth rate of expenses, ensure -- and try to make sure that we get that good comparison with the growth rate of revenues. In any point particular quarter, it's tough to do. As you saw in the first quarter, a significant decline in the equity markets having an impact on our revenue on a short-term basis. Our expenses will catch up with that -- with the rest of the year. Hope that helps."

And I got to tell you, Steven, I just want to make a couple more comments on DOL more broadly just to set the tone, in addition to my earlier prepared comments. We just can't, as a country, lose the fact that we've amassed $15 trillion in rollover IRAs, 401(k)s; another $7 trillion in defined benefit. There's $22 trillion in this country, which arguably would make it the most successful retirement system anywhere in the world. Secondly, the DOL, I believe their intentions are good. When I think about the intent of the law, it's to protect the interest of U.S. retirement savers. It's about creating transparency around cost and benefits and value. It's also about making sure we have access to the competitive marketplace. There are some unintended consequences, and that's what Deanna will respond to in just a minute, relative to working with advisers. There's a view that the Robo solution solves all problems for small account balance holders. That's just not the case, and so we have some more work to do there. The second is we want to make sure that we're not creating barriers that reduce the number of advisers that have in the past and will in the future provide important education to individuals and to savers. And then we also want to make sure that we don't limit the number of individualized solutions that we can present to plan participants. They're very dependent on that enroller, if you will. So with that as a backdrop, I'll ask Deanna to weigh in on the implications on Principal adviser network and how we might have to do things slightly differently."

And first of all, I want to put into kind of context the impact on our affiliated distribution. And so first, I think it's important to point out that our advisers sell and service across the entire range of product offerings, including many products within Principal that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. In fact, a majority of that systems revenue comes from transactions that aren't impacted by the proposal. Having said that, I think there's a couple of points that I think is important to keep in mind as we think about even those products that do fall under the regulation. First of all, as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, the final regs did allow for a pass-forward on proprietary products, and that applies to both funds within our retirement plan as well as retail products sold at the time of either retirement or when participants change job. I think the other thing to keep in mind is our affiliated advisers already today have choice. We have both proprietary and nonproprietary products and solutions, and our proprietary offerings will have to continue to compete on items such as investment performance and service as they do today. So we will have some business model changes for that channel that will come in the realm of compensation changes, like you mentioned, compliance. But I think we're very confident that our business model can adjust and feel good about our ability to comply as well as continue to stay focused on meeting the needs of those customers that we serve."

And we think that, as you mentioned though, that the share buyback program is a very important part of that so far. So through the first quarter, we add $86 million. As of yesterday, we added another $26 million in the program. So we're over $100 million now. We're looking at it long term. We do have a program that gets accelerated as the share price goes lower. Hopefully, we won’t have to worry about that in the near future. But as we look into the second half of the year, we've got options. We've got opportunities to continue to pay out our dividend and increase it towards that 40% payout ratio. We're also looking at acquisition activity for the remainder of the year. And as we've talked about in the past, we've looked at increasing our share of some PGI boutiques, and so we'll look at that as well. We'll also think about the share buyback. So as I've mentioned, we've continued to build that out. And so we've got over $360 million yet in our authorization. So that is a very integral part of the share buyback -- excuse me, of the capital deployment strategy in this environment. And then we're also going to continue to look at opportunities to change our capital structure and reduce our debt leverage because we do have some high-coupon debt out there that we could, if the opportunity presents itself, use that for that. So we're going to continue very balanced, disciplined, long-term approach to our capital deployment strategy. And I think we're well on our way to distributing that $800 million to $1 billion. Hope that helps."

We did an outstanding job in the current quarter retaining clients. We did a nice job acquiring clients. Our strong investment performance certainly help -- contributes to that success. Having said that, again, net cash flow was healthy for us, but these are things that are a little bit lumpy, and I'll have Nora kind of weigh in now and talk about some of that lumpiness and her views broadly on the FSA line."

We certainly believe we're striking the right balance, and we think we have the proof points for it. With the kind of plan retention we're seeing, with the kind of the sales we're seeing, we're always looking at -- obviously we've got a competitive market we're dealing in, but one of the things that we're seeing is, in particular in that small to medium, that core segment of our market, we're seeing just a tremendous opportunity for us as we move in that space. And what I -- and what we've seen is as we look at that growth in our -- both in our sales and retention, that, that's the piece of it that is really outperforming for us. The lumpiness that we talked about or the volatility we talked about comes on 1 or 2 larger cases. So you think in terms of $500 million or north of $500 million. Now oftentimes, when we talk about the discipline between growth and profitability, it's with those larger cases in making a decision that we're not willing to race to the bottom on pricing. So that's the kind of lumpiness you'll see, and that's why we'll have quarters like we had this quarter with a $3 billion really outstanding net cash flow. But we don't want to get over our skis extrapolating that because we will have 1 or 2 large plan decisions over the year that will move that number, which is why we continue to reaffirm the guidance that if we look at a full year rather than quarter-to-quarter, if we look at a full year, we're confident given what we see today that we're going to be well within that 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account value. But the caveat that we always throw out is because our core business is small and medium businesses, when you have 1 or 2 of those larger cases moving in or out, that can swing the numbers, which is why we tend to look full year rather than quarter-to-quarter."

We have a tremendous amount of choice there. We got extremely strong investment performance. So we compete in that space very well with regard to that suite of key asset classes. In addition, on service side, because of our scale, we're able to move up and down, whether it's a small business, a medium business or a large business. And we scaled our service platform to the point where that is seamless for us. So we compete very well in that space, both on the investment side and the service side.

The TRS, the Total Retirement Suite, still is a very, very powerful tool for The Principal that can differentiate value from pure 401(k) players, and so that again is a differentiator. Frozen defined benefits, deferred compensation, ESOP had a nice quarter here. So that is a nice differentiator. The other point I'd make is because it was -- this generalization of large case pricing. There are so many components that go into the pricing of a large plan. How many payroll centers? What's the current penetration rate relative to participant involvement? What's the customized communications package? All of those variables go into it. So when we lose a plan or win a plan, it's because we've done the homework behind the scenes to understand exactly what kind of resources are going to have to be deployed against that plan. So that's why at any given time, you could lose a plan or win a plan. But again, we like the model that we have. We think it resonates in the marketplace, and our retention rates would imply that those large plans appreciate it. Hopefully that helps."

They're going to call into a call center like they always have because that's the typical sort of process. And they're going to be having a conversation with a person providing education and guidance. And they're going to disclose what the pricing is in the current plan structure, in a qualified retirement plan. And it could be larger plan, and there's going to be a certain price. And they're also, as I always have in the past disclosed to them, that there are other options for them to consider. They could move that money to a rollover IRA with The Principal or they could roll over that money to a third party. And the names are common. You would know all of those. And the burden that now falls on the adviser is that the participant has a very clear understanding that they're moving from one product to another. And they have to look at it on a couple of different dimensions. One dimension, of course, is the investment lineup. Is it same or is it different? Another dimension is what's the underlying performance of those investment options? The third dimension is on the price. What am I paying and what am I getting in exchange for that? And it doesn't have to be the same price, but there has to be a thorough understanding and explanation on why there is a difference for the price being paid. That action onto itself is going to take a longer conversation for fully vetting that opportunity. It ties back to my earlier statements that small account balance holders could find that there are fewer advisers willing to invest the time and the energy to vet every one of those situations. So I think there is a likelihood that 401(k) service providers could end up almost by default retaining maybe more of those smaller account balances after they've had that discussion with that phone counselor. I think on the larger account balances, there are advisers that are going to be spending the time to help vet the opportunity. And the last comment I would make is remember that we are a significant player in the rollover business for Defined Contribution Investment Only, where Jim McCaughan's PGI investment products not only find themselves on the platform of many 401(k) chassis, but also they find themselves on rollover IRA chassis. And again, with strong performance and investment options that solve needs for long-term savers, I think that's a net plus. So hopefully, that's not too long winded of an answer, John. Do you have a follow-up?"

So I think there's some signs that these emerging countries are going through the process.

So what happened with our net customer cash flow? You could see our financial supplement, trailing 12 months, we are flying at $9.3 billion in trailing 12 months. We put in $900 million net customer cash flows in the first quarter. If you're looking the trend that we have had during 2015 first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, in the first part of the year, average per quarter $2.5 billion, $3 billion in net customer cash flows; average in the second part of the year, $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion; and then we had $1 billion. But if you're going into the first quarter, I would say that January, February, March, they had a very positive,  I would say, behavior.

I'll then turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on financial results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
Principal had a solid start to the year as we continue to focus on meeting the needs of our customers. Our first quarter results were impacted by volatile equity markets, low interest rates and unfavorable currency exchange. Once again, our diversified business model by product offering, by geography and by asset class helped stabilize earnings and grow assets under management. 
Despite challenging operating conditions, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $1.2 billion of after-tax operating earnings and increased assets under management to a record $548 billion. These results demonstrate our ability to focus on the things within our control, like delivering outcomes-based solutions to customers around the world and maintaining industry-leading margins in a competitive environment. 
Importantly, the fundamentals of business remains strong. As Slide 5 shows, more than 90% of our investment options were in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 3- and 5-year by basis. 
Additionally, we received several third-party recognitions for performance in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 6. Barron's Magazine recognized Principal as the sixth best mutual fund manager based on a 5-year period and as a top 5 municipal manager. CIMB-Principal won the award for the best Asia-Pacific Equity Fund at the 2016 Morningstar Awards and won 6 2016 Edge Lipper Fund Awards, including Best Overall Group. Hong Kong was awarded the MPF Scheme [ph] of the Year in 2016 MPF Awards. Mexico was awarded the best balanced fund in 2015 by Morningstar. 
Outstanding investment performance coupled with our broad multi-channel distribution network enable us to generate more than $3 billion in total company net cash flows for the quarter and $17 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, while many in the industry experienced outflows. The Retirement and Income Solution - Fee business had $3 billion of quarterly net cash flows due to strong sales and plan-level retention in the quarter. 
Principal Global Investors had a single large, passively managed currency overlay mandate lapse in the first quarter. Equity and fixed income net cash flows were $3 billion in total as our distinctive active strategies and outcome-based solutions continue to resonate with investors. And Principal International had its 30th consecutive quarter of positive reported net cash flows. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to strengthen our competitive position. I'll start with a comment on our global brand launch, followed by ways we're enhancing our solution set, expanding distribution and improving customer outcomes. 
One of the more notable achievements for the quarter was the roll out of our refresh global brand. Our new brand better represents how we help people in all life stages achieve financial success. The brand underscores our commitment to the underserved markets, including small and medium-size businesses in the U.S. and emerging markets, with growing middle-class populations in Latin America and Asia, and it reflects our intensified focus on make it easier for everyone, individuals, business owners, advisors and institutional clients to do business with us. 
In March, we planted another important seed in Asia. We signed a memorandum of understanding with China Construction Bank, the second largest bank in the world, to develop a new asset management and pension partnership. Principal and China Construction Bank jointly created CCB-Principal Asset Management company in 2005, and it has become a leading fund management company in China. This new agreement enhances our existing long-term successful relationship and is a key to creating future opportunities for Principal to participate in the  significant pension and asset management opportunities in China. 
Also in the quarter, we purchased the remaining stake in Claritas. With a leading asset manager in Brazil, we are well positioned to capture the growing opportunity as investors seek to diversify their portfolio by geography and asset class. Claritas also provides a mutual fund distribution platform in Brazil for several funds managed by Principal Global Investors, further expanding the synergies of our business. Despite political and economic volatility, Brazil continues to generate positive cash flows and remains a very important market for us with excellent long-term growth opportunities. 
Moving to our solution set. We further expanded our investment and distribution platform in the first quarter, launching 2 new ETFs: the Price Setters Index ETF and the Shareholder Yield Index ETF. Our target-date collective investment trust, or CITs, are gaining significant traction in the retirement space, including the Defined Contribution Investment Only channel, due to strong investment performance. At the end of the first quarter, 8 out of 12 of the funds in our target-date CIT series were in the top decile on a 3- and 5-year basis. The demand for our target-date investment options remain high among retirement plan clients as we provide broad diversified choices with our multi-manager options, including both active and passive strategies. 
In addition to expanding our investment platform, we continue to invest in innovative customer solutions to drive further growth. Following our examples of recent initiatives to help people get on the path to financial security and improve customer outcomes, we recently launched Principal Pension Builder, which gives participants the opportunity to purchase an in-plan annuity, give them easy access to guaranteed income through their retirement. We continue our efforts to aggressively promote PlanWorks, our suite of best-in-class plan designs that include features like automatic enrollment and automatic deferral increases. These plan designs are resulting in higher participation and higher savings rates versus traditional opt-in plan designs. 
Additionally, we recently introduced My Virtual Coach, which is driving outcomes as well. This innovative virtual-assisted interactive enrollment and education tool makes it easier than ever for 401(k) plan participants to save for retirement and appeals to a new generation of investors. 
On the protection side, we're also using technology to improve the customer experience when buying life and disability insurance. Recently, we launched the first phase of a digital sales solution for these products on principal.com. The solution delivers tools to help potential customers assess their coverage needs, get a price quote and obtain assistance to complete the process. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll close with comments on the final fiduciary rule released by the Department of Labor on April 6.  Though we're still thoroughly reviewing the nearly 1,000-page document, I have some overall comments to make. As we've said before, we remain concerned that some individuals will receive less help in the future than they do today. That said, we remain hopeful we can work with the Department of Labor towards the end goal of helping Americans adequately prepare for retirement. Implementation is clearly top of mind, and we continue to work with the industry and distribution firms to clarify this complex rule and design responsive business models to serve clients regardless of size. There will certainly be transition cost and higher ongoing compliance cost, but we don't expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. Importantly, based on our review of the final rule, we'll still be able to help small businesses with their retirement plans, and our affiliated distribution channels will still be able to sell proprietary products. 
We'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and by providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Despite the challenges, we believe we'll continue to gain market share as distribution firms potentially limit who they work with to a smaller number of providers that can help them manage and comply with the revised rules.  We'll also gain market share as we accelerate growth of our Defined Contribution Investment Only business and experience higher retention rates of retirees. 
In closing, I remain optimistic about the remainder of 2016 and beyond. The fundamentals of the business are strong, and we'll continue to strengthen our competitive position despite an operating environment that remains challenging. Terry?"
201105,313906463,967859,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan.

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
As Dan said, we viewed first quarter results as a solid start to 2016. Despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we see the strength of the underlying fundamentals of our business and signs that some headwinds experienced for some time might be weakening. 
Total company after-tax operating earnings for the first quarter were $286 million, a 12% decline versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a continued volatile operating environment. An important proxy for our fee revenue is the S&P 500 daily average, which was down approximately 5% compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. This negatively impacted the daily average revenue from our fee businesses, the primary driver of earnings. This is the first time since third quarter of 2009 that the S&P 500 daily average declined compared to the prior year period. 
Additionally, foreign currency translation negatively impacted current quarter earnings compared to the prior year quarter. Operating earnings are translated using the average currency exchange rates. However, for the first time since second quarter 2014, the U.S. dollar spot rate weakened versus all 3 of our Latin American currencies during the quarter. This was a benefit to assets under management as foreign exchange for assets under management is translated on a spot rate basis. 
Over the long term, we continue to align revenue and expense growth to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. Expense initiatives started in the first quarter will benefit earnings in the second half of the year and beyond. 
As shown on Slide 8, reported earnings per share were $0.97 for first quarter 2016, an 8% decline compared to the normalized year ago quarter, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate and volatile equity markets. 
At the end of the first quarter, return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment, was 13.4%. The 160 basis point decline from first quarter 2015 is predominantly due to the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lower prepayment fees. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results starting on Slide 9 with Retirement Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee, businesses. First quarter pretax operating earnings of $114 million were down 17% from the normalized year ago quarter. Quarterly net revenue decreased 6% from the prior year normalized quarter, driven by unfavorable equity market conditions. On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 30%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, pretax return on net revenue was 32%. Given normal market conditions, we are confident our industry-leading margin will continue to be within our previously stated range of 28% to 32% throughout 2016. RIS-Fee had strong net free cash flow of $3 billion in the first quarter. For full year 2016, we still expect net cash flow to be on our stated 1% to 3% range as we continue to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. The balance of strong sales and retention, combined with expected equity market returns and continued expense alignment, should drive a stronger finish to 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings was $67 million, a 10% increase over the year ago quarter. The rise in earnings, which is in line with the 10% growth in the RIS-Spread average account values, was driven by strong sales of all spread products. On a trailing 12-month basis, the normalized pretax return on net revenue was 55% and within our guided range. RIS-Spread continues to perform well as the market volatility has created opportunities as clients welcome guaranteed solutions even in the low interest rate environment. The pipeline remains strong, and we continue to approach the pension closeout and Investment Only businesses opportunistically. 
Turning to Slide 11. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $80 million in the first quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by volatile market performance as well as lower performance and transaction fees in first quarter 2016. The low performance and transaction fees in the first quarter were a result of timing differences as we see good visibility for more normal levels in the remainder of 2016. 
While these performance and transactions fees fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the best measure of our ongoing development in asset management is management fees. These increased slightly from a year ago quarter and increased more than 6% on a trailing 12-month basis in spite of the severe industry headwinds. On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 33% and within our expected range. 
Quarterly net cash flows were a positive $700 million despite the lapse of a $3.3 billion passively managed low-fee currency overlay mandate. The new business pipeline remains strong. 
Slide 12 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $68 million. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for encaje performance, Principal International continues to have mid-teens growth in operating earnings. First quarter 2016 encaje performance was $4 million pretax lower than expected, while the year ago quarter benefited $5 million pretax from better-than-expected encaje performance. 
We're continuing to build traction in China. Quarterly pretax operating earnings in China more than tripled over the prior year quarter providing further diversification within Principal International. 
We continue to work with our joint venture partner, China Construction Bank, to develop a diversified product portfolio and provide investment solutions for long-term savings. Compared to the prior year quarter, the strengthening U.S. dollar suppressed Principal International pretax operating earnings by $16 million. Over the trailing 12 months, foreign exchange has reduced Principal International assets under management by $9 billion [ph]. However, strengthening Latin American currencies in the latter part of the first quarter 2016 had a favorable $8 billion [ph] impact on assets under management in the quarter. If sustained, this improved exchange rate could provide a tailwind to next quarter's operating earnings. 
Moving to Slide 13. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $39 million. First quarter 2015 was positively impacted by the recovery of reinsurance premiums partially offset by higher expenses. After normalizing prior year results, pretax operating earnings decreased 5%. Growth in the block of business was offset by higher individual disability claims compared to the prior period, which can be volatile in any one quarter. The overall loss ratio for the first quarter was within the targeted range. 
The underlying fundamentals of the business remains strong with record sales and retention and normalized premium and fee growth of 8% as well as double-digit increase in trailing 12-month pretax operating earnings. As a reminder, Specialty Benefits operating earnings are seasonally impacted by higher first quarter dental and vision claims and higher first quarter nondeferred sales-related expenses. Typically, distribution of annual earnings in this business is 20% in the first quarter, 25% in the second and third quarters and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 14, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% from the prior year period. This was a strong result, leading to pretax margin of 16%, which is at the higher end of our range. Results this quarter were driven by higher interest margins as well as favorable mortality on a growing block of business.  Business market sales remain strong at 56% of total sales in the first quarter. 
Corporate pretax operating losses of $53 million were lower than expected due to timing of some of our funded initiatives. We anticipate full year 2016 corporate pretax operating losses to be at the lower end of our previously announced range of $235 million to $265 million. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $368 million, including net realized capital gains of $82 million. Lower interest rates led to gains of $112 million in our derivative portfolio, partially offset by $30 million of credit-related losses. Our investment portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations as credit stress was isolated to the energy and basic industry sectors. We remain confident in our diversified high-quality investment portfolio. Again, due to our disciplined asset liability management, we are not forced sellers in stressed times. 
As outlined on Slide 15, we continue to target $800 million to $1 billion of capital deployment in 2016. In first quarter 2016, we paid a $0.38 common stock dividend, a strong dividend yield in the current low interest rate environment.  Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.39 per share payable in the second quarter, as we continue to increase our dividend payout ratio. 
In addition, we repurchased $86 million worth of common stock in the first quarter, completing the remainder of our 2015 authorization. In February, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $400 million share repurchase program. $389 million of that authorization remained outstanding at the end of the first quarter. 
We continue to have a balanced approach to capital deployment and consider all options, including dividends, acquisitions, share repurchase and reducing our leverage ratio. 
In the current environment, we view share repurchase as an effective way to increase long-term value for shareholders. Despite the volatile operating environment, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we will continue to focus on things within our control to drive growth and profitability for the long term. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

You'll have seen from Page 3 of the supplement that management fee revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, we show that, and this thing called Other revenue. The 2 biggest parts of Other revenue are borrower fees on commercial mortgage origination and incentive fees on various strategies from hedge funds to real estate funds to various institutional accounts that have an incentive fee. So those are shown in Other revenues. And you'll see, if you look back at the trailing 12 months, that's been typically, give or take, 20% to 25% of our total revenues of PGI. It's been pretty steady. What's happened during the first quarter is that borrowers on commercial mortgages delayed closing because of market instability. And it so happened, this is partly random actually, that the incentive fees were actually basically 0 in the first quarter. Now the incentive fees can be on a 1-year cycle, a 3-year cycle or be dependent on the realization of the underlying asset. Those are really the 3 ways they tend to operate, and most quarters, we get some. They're, as you know, back-end loaded to the fourth quarter, which is partly why we showed trailing 12-months in the supplement. So this preamble is really a buildup to a couple of numbers I can give you, if I can identify them here in my notes. If you look at the quarter, the year ago quarter, just for example, was a typical 20% Other revenue quarter. We had $264.2 million of management fees and $64.7 million of Other revenue. The quarter just ended that we're reporting on had $265.4 million of management fees. So actually, up slightly on a year ago quarter, but only $44.2 million of Other revenue, as all the phenomena I mentioned were slowing client activities. We have done a pretty thorough bottom-up analysis of what Other revenues will look like during the rest of the year, and we are basically anticipating that the year will be much more typical of the last 2 or 3 years and that really what has happened is a little bit random, but more important, the client activities will pick up again. So we remain pretty perky about what the year as a whole will look like."

We're pretty confident that the 33% to 36% range that we mentioned for return on that revenue in the guidance call in December, that remains a pretty good guide to how we'll look for the year on all current indications. In terms of investment for growth. As you know, we're one of the few global asset managers who's actually growing revenues at the moment. There's a lot of rather vicious industry headwinds. The volumes in new business we're taking on are definitely leading to elevated costs. Both the costs of taking the business on in terms of commission and setup expenses, but also developing our sales force and our ability to serve clients, whether it's different -- whether it's new share classes in mutual funds or new offices internationally, those are all expansionary things we're doing, but they're all costing money. And that's why 33% to 36% remains our guideline, not higher. There are asset managers with higher margins, there's a few, but they're mostly firms who are not growing or even in some cases shrinking. I would rather have our balance, but hope that answers the question, Erik."

As we've talked about in the past, we look at the relationship between our growth and our revenue and our growth and our expenses. We've always tried to have this 1% to 2% differential, i.e., the revenue growing faster than expenses. But when you look back to 2014, as part of the trailing 12 months, and as always, we try to look at it over a longer period of time because of some volatility that could occur in any one particular period, 2014 was a pretty tough comparison because of the strong revenue growth as well as the expenses that we had. So looking at it in terms of more of a sequential basis, you've seen a pretty significant reduction in our expense growth from fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. It's down approximately 5% or $44 million. Now we think that as you go forward, we're going to continue to align our expenses and revenue. And as Jim talked about, he's looking to the future of PGI. We also look across all of our organizations, and we feel more comfortable about the growth rate for the entire year. If you look at 2016 compared to 2015, we'll see that 1% differential in our revenue growth. We think that 2015 is probably a more comparable year. And if you look at expenses in the first quarter of 2016, I'd say that, that's probably more comparable to what you'll see the rest of the year than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. So again, we look at the growth rate of expenses, ensure -- and try to make sure that we get that good comparison with the growth rate of revenues. In any point particular quarter, it's tough to do. As you saw in the first quarter, a significant decline in the equity markets having an impact on our revenue on a short-term basis. Our expenses will catch up with that -- for the rest of the year. Hope that helps."

We just can't, as a country, lose the fact that we've amassed $15 trillion in rollover IRAs, 401(k)s; another $7 trillion in defined benefit. There's $22 trillion in this country, which arguably would make it the most successful retirement system anywhere in the world. Secondly, the DOL, I believe their intentions are good. When I think about the intent of the law, it's to protect the interest of U.S. retirement savers. It's about creating transparency around cost and benefits and value. It's also about making sure we have access to the competitive marketplace. There are some unintended consequences, and that's what Deanna will respond to in just a minute, relative to working with advisers. There's a view that the Robo solution solves all problems for small account balance holders. That's just not the case, and so we have some more work to do there. The second is we want to make sure that we're not creating barriers that reduce the number of advisers that have in the past and will in the future provide important education to individuals and to savers. And then we also want to make sure that we don't limit the number of individualized solutions that we can present to plan participants. They're very dependent on that enroller, if you will. So with that as a backdrop, I'll ask Deanna to weigh in on the implications on Principal adviser network and how we might have to do things slightly differently."

And first of all, I want to put into kind of context the impact on our affiliated distribution. And so first, I think it's important to point out that our advisers sell and service across the entire range of product offerings, including many products within Principal that are not impacted by the DOL regulations. In fact, a majority of that systems revenue comes from transactions that aren't impacted by the proposal. Having said that, I think there's a couple of points that I think is important to keep in mind as we think about even those products that do fall under the regulations. First of all, as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, the final regs did allow for a pass-forward on proprietary products, and that applies to both funds within a retirement plan as well as retail products sold at the time of either retirement or when participants change jobs. I think the other thing to keep in mind is our affiliated advisers already today have choice. We have both proprietary and nonproprietary products and solutions, and our proprietary offerings will have to continue to compete on items such as investment performance and service as they do today. So we will have some business model changes for that channel that will come in the realm of compensation changes, like you mentioned, compliance. But I think we're very confident that our business model can adjust and feel good about our ability to comply as well as continue to stay focused on meeting the needs of those customers that we serve."

We're looking for that, what will enhance the shareholder's value. Now buying back shares is one of the options, but we look at all kinds of different things in terms of to enhance shareholder value as well as to distribute that value as it's created. If you look at over the last several years, you'd see we've done a pretty good job of balancing it between our organic growth and acquisitions in order to create shareholder value and then increasing our dividend payout ratio, as we've just increased the dividend again, as we marched towards that 40% of net income. And buybacks is just another part of the program here. And so we talked about, in 2016, $800 million to $1 billion, and we're on track to do that. And we think that, as you mentioned though, that the share buyback program is a very important part of that so far. So through the first quarter, we had $86 million. As of yesterday, we added another $26 million in the program. So we're over $100 million now. We're looking at it long term. We do have a program that gets accelerated as the share price goes lower. Hopefully, we won’t have to worry about that in the near future. But as we look into the second half of the year, we've got options. We've got opportunities to continue to pay out our dividend and increase it towards that 40% payout ratio. We're also looking at acquisition activity for the remainder of the year. And as we've talked about in the past, we've looked at increasing our share of some PGI boutiques, and so we'll look at that as well. We'll also think about the share buyback. So as I've mentioned, we've continued to build that out. And so we've got over $360 million yet in our authorization. So that is a very integral part of the share buyback -- excuse me, of the capital deployment strategy in this environment. And then we're also going to continue to look at opportunities to change our capital structure and reduce our debt leverage because we do have some high-coupon debt out there that we could, if the opportunity presents itself, use that for that. So we're going to continue very balanced, disciplined, long-term approach to our capital deployment strategy. And I think we're well on our way to distributing that $800 million to $1 billion. Hope that helps."

With the kind of plan retention we're seeing, with the kind of the sales we're seeing, we're always looking at -- obviously we've got a competitive market we're dealing in, but one of the things that we're seeing is, in particular in that small to medium, that core segment of our market, we're seeing just a tremendous opportunity for us as we move in that space. And what I -- and what we've seen is, as we look at that growth in our -- both in our sales and retention, that, that's the piece of it that is really outperforming for us. The lumpiness that we talked about or the volatility we talked about comes with 1 or 2 larger cases. So you think in terms of $500 million or north of $500 million. Now oftentimes, when we talk about the discipline between growth and profitability, it's with those larger cases in making a decision that we're not willing to race to the bottom on pricing. So that's the kind of lumpiness you'll see, and that's why we'll have quarters like we had this quarter with a $3 billion really outstanding net cash flow. But we don't want to get over our skis extrapolating that because we will have 1 or 2 large plan decisions over the year that will move that number, which is why we continue to reaffirm the guidance that if we look at a full year rather than quarter-to-quarter, if we look at a full year, we're confident given what we see today that we're going to be well within that 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account value. But the caveat that we always throw out is because our core business is small and medium businesses, when you have 1 or 2 of those larger cases moving in or out, that can swing the numbers, which is why we tend to look full year rather than quarter-to-quarter."

Frozen defined benefits, deferred compensation, ESOP had a nice quarter here. So that is a nice differentiator. The other point I'd make is because it was -- this generalization of large case pricing. There are so many components that go into the pricing of a large plan. How many payroll centers? What's the current penetration rate relative to participant involvement? What's the customized communications package? All of those variables go into it. So when we lose a plan or win a plan, it's because we've done the homework behind the scenes to understand exactly what kind of resources are going to have to be deployed against that plan. So that's why at any given time, you could lose a plan or win a plan. But again, we like the model that we have.

I would not anticipate there to be any pressure coming off fee structures because of DOL. Could it cause some additional discussion? It should because it's really around transparency and making sure the people understand what they're paying and what they're getting for their money. So again, I think on a marginal basis, I think we'll continue to have a lot of dialogue around cost and pricing. And Nora wanted to make one more comment here."

And when you think about that, the logical conclusion is you're going to have subscale players, or folks that don't have this as their core business, having a moment in time here where there may be moving out of the market. So we see it as an opportunity around consolidation. And I think that goes back to your question about pricing. I think the irony here is that those of us who are at scale that have the expertise are going to stay in the market. And I think there will be a number of players who will take this as their opportunity to exit the market."

They're going to call into a call center like they always have because that's the typical sort of process. And they're going to be having a conversation with a person providing education and guidance. And they're going to disclose what the pricing is in the current plan structure, in a qualified retirement plan. And it could be larger plan, and there's going to be a certain price. And they're also, as I always have in the past disclosed to them, that there are other options for them to consider. They could move that money to a rollover IRA with the Principal or they could roll over that money to a third party. And the names are common. You would know all of those. And the burden that now falls on the adviser is that the participant has a very clear understanding that they're moving from one product to another. And they have to look at it on a couple of different dimensions. One dimension, of course, is the investment lineup. Is it same or is it different? Another dimension is what's the underlying performance of those investment options? The third dimension is on the price. What am I paying and what am I getting in exchange for that? And it doesn't have to be the same price, but there has to be a thorough understanding and explanation on why there is a difference for the price being paid. That action onto itself is going to take a longer conversation for fully vetting that opportunity. It ties back to my earlier statements that small account balance holders could find that there are fewer advisers willing to invest the time and the energy to vet every one of those situations. So I think there is a likelihood that 401(k) service providers could end up almost by default retaining maybe more of those smaller account balances after they've had that discussion with that phone counselor. I think on the larger account balances, there are advisers that are going to be spending the time to help vet the opportunity. And the last comment I would make is remember that we are a significant player in the rollover business for Defined Contribution Investment Only, where Jim McCaughan's PGI investment products not only find themselves on the platform of many 401(k) chassis, but also they find themselves on rollover IRA chassis. And again, with strong performance and investment options that solve needs for long-term savers, I think that's a net plus. So hopefully, that's not too long winded of an answer, John. Do you have a follow-up?"

I'm also encouraged by some of the recovery that's happening in some of the countries, like Brazil, where you see their equity markets in the first quarter recovering by almost 12% and -- or up 15% and the currency has recovered by approximately 12%. So I think there's some signs that these emerging countries are going through the process. They're -- although they still show negative GDP in some cases, there is some sign that there's new capital being infused in those countries and things are bouncing back. But to your specific question on net cash flow, I'll defer to Luis to answer that."

If you look in the equities index, FX confidence indexes and commodity prices, even interest rates, are showing a much better picture for emerging markets today: oil prices above $46, $48 today; copper prices in $2.28; FX going in the right direction. So what happened with our net customer cash flow? You could see our financial supplement, trailing 12 months, we are flying at $9.3 billion in trailing 12 months. We put in $900 million net customer cash flows in the first quarter. If you're looking the trend that we have had during 2015 first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, in the first part of the year, average per quarter $2.5 billion, $3 billion in net customer cash flows; average in the second part of the year, $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion; and then we had $1 billion. But if you're going into the first quarter, I would say that January, February, March, they had a very positive, I would say, behavior. February was a pretty much more flat, better February and much better March. So I would say that the $900 million that we do had in first quarter is not an indication of what is our real run rate that we are looking forward during 2016."

I'll then turn the call over to Terry, who will provide additional details on financial results. As John mentioned, slides related to today's call are available on our website. The key themes are outlined on Slide 4. 
Principal had a solid start to the year as we continue to focus on meeting the needs of our customers. Our first quarter results were impacted by volatile equity markets, low interest rates and unfavorable currency exchange. Once again, our diversified business model by product offering, by geography and by asset class helped stabilize earnings and grow assets under management. 
Despite challenging operating conditions, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $1.2 billion of after-tax operating earnings and increased assets under management to a record $548 billion. These results demonstrate our ability to focus on the things within our control, like delivering outcomes-based solutions to customers around the world and maintaining industry-leading margins in a competitive environment. 
Importantly, the fundamentals of business remains strong. As Slide 5 shows, more than 90% of our investment options were in the top 2 Morningstar quartiles on a 3- and 5-year by basis. 
Additionally, we received several third-party recognitions for performance in the first quarter, as shown on Slide 6. Barron's Magazine recognized Principal as the sixth best mutual fund manager based on a 5-year period and as a top 5 municipal manager. CIMB-Principal won the award for the best Asia-Pacific Equity Fund at the 2016 Morningstar Awards and won 6 2016 Edge Lipper Fund Awards, including Best Overall Group. Hong Kong was awarded the MPF Scheme [ph] of the Year in 2016 MPF Awards. Mexico was awarded the best balanced fund in 2015 by Morningstar. 
Outstanding investment performance coupled with our broad multi-channel distribution network enable us to generate more than $3 billion in total company net cash flows for the quarter and $17 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, while many in the industry experienced outflows. The Retirement and Income Solution - Fee business had $3 billion of quarterly net cash flows due to strong sales and plan-level retention in the quarter. 
Principal Global Investors had a single large, passively managed currency overlay mandate lapse in the first quarter. Equity and fixed income net cash flows were $3 billion in total as our distinctive active strategies and outcome-based solutions continue to resonate with investors. And Principal International had its 30th consecutive quarter of positive reported net cash flows. 
Next, I'll provide some examples of how we continue to strengthen our competitive position. I'll start with a comment on our global brand launch, followed by ways we're enhancing our solution set, expanding distribution and improving customer outcomes. 
One of the more notable achievements for the quarter was the roll out of our refresh global brand. Our new brand better represents how we help people in all life stages achieve financial success. The brand underscores our commitment to the underserved markets, including small and medium-size businesses in the U.S. and emerging markets, with growing middle-class populations in Latin America and Asia, and it reflects our intensified focus on make it easier for everyone, individuals, business owners, advisors and institutional clients to do business with us. 
In March, we planted another important seed in Asia. We signed a memorandum of understanding with China Construction Bank, the second largest bank in the world, to develop a new asset management and pension partnership. Principal and China Construction Bank jointly created CCB-Principal Asset Management company in 2005, and it has become a leading fund management company in China. This new agreement enhances our existing long-term successful relationship and is a key to creating future opportunities for Principal to participate in the  significant pension and asset management opportunities in China. 
Also in the quarter, we purchased the remaining stake in Claritas. With a leading asset manager in Brazil, we are well positioned to capture the growing opportunity as investors seek to diversify their portfolio by geography and asset class. Claritas also provides a mutual fund distribution platform in Brazil for several funds managed by Principal Global Investors, further expanding the synergies of our business. Despite political and economic volatility, Brazil continues to generate positive cash flows and remains a very important market for us with excellent long-term growth opportunities. 
Moving to our solution set. We further expanded our investment and distribution platform in the first quarter, launching 2 new ETFs: the Price Setters Index ETF and the Shareholder Yield Index ETF. Our target-date collective investment trust, or CITs, are gaining significant traction in the retirement space, including the Defined Contribution Investment Only channel, due to strong investment performance. At the end of the first quarter, 8 out of 12 of the funds in our target-date CIT series were in the top decile on a 3- and 5-year basis. The demand for our target-date investment options remain high among retirement plan clients as we provide broad diversified choices with our multi-manager options, including both active and passive strategies. 
In addition to expanding our investment platform, we continue to invest in innovative customer solutions to drive further growth. Following our examples of recent initiatives to help people get on the path to financial security and improve customer outcomes, we recently launched Principal Pension Builder, which gives participants the opportunity to purchase an in-plan annuity, give them easy access to guaranteed income through their retirement. We continue our efforts to aggressively promote PlanWorks, our suite of best-in-class plan designs that include features like automatic enrollment and automatic deferral increases. These plan designs are resulting in higher participation and higher savings rates versus traditional opt-in plan designs. 
Additionally, we recently introduced My Virtual Coach, which is driving outcomes as well. This innovative virtual-assisted interactive enrollment and education tool makes it easier than ever for 401(k) plan participants to save for retirement and appeals to a new generation of investors. 
On the protection side, we're also using technology to improve the customer experience when buying life and disability insurance. Recently, we launched the first phase of a digital sales solution for these products on principal.com. The solution delivers tools to help potential customers assess their coverage needs, get a price quote and obtain assistance to complete the process. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll close with comments on the final fiduciary rule released by the Department of Labor on April 6.  Though we're still thoroughly reviewing the nearly 1,000-page document, I have some overall comments to make. As we've said before, we remain concerned that some individuals will receive less help in the future than they do today. That said, we remain hopeful we can work with the Department of Labor towards the end goal of helping Americans adequately prepare for retirement. Implementation is clearly top of mind, and we continue to work with the industry and distribution firms to clarify this complex rule and design responsive business models to serve clients regardless of size. There will certainly be transition cost and higher ongoing compliance cost, but we don't expect a significant increase in our run rate expenses. Importantly, based on our review of the final rule, we'll still be able to help small businesses with their retirement plans, and our affiliated distribution channels will still be able to sell proprietary products. 
We'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and by providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Despite the challenges, we believe we'll continue to gain market share as distribution firms potentially limit who they work with to a smaller number of providers that can help them manage and comply with the revised rules.  We'll also gain market share as we accelerate growth of our Defined Contribution Investment Only business and experience higher retention rates of retirees. 
In closing, I remain optimistic about the remainder of 2016 and beyond. The fundamentals of the business are strong, and we'll continue to strengthen our competitive position despite an operating environment that remains challenging. Terry?"

As Dan said, we viewed first quarter results as a solid start to 2016. Despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, we see the strength of the underlying fundamentals of our business and signs that some headwinds experienced for some time might be weakening. 
Total company after-tax operating earnings for the first quarter were $286 million, a 12% decline versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting a continued volatile operating environment. An important proxy for our fee revenue is the S&P 500 daily average, which was down approximately 5% compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2015. This negatively impacted the daily average revenue from our fee businesses, the primary driver of earnings. This is the first time since third quarter of 2009 that the S&P 500 daily average declined compared to the prior year period. 
Additionally, foreign currency translation negatively impacted current quarter earnings compared to the prior year quarter. Operating earnings are translated using the average currency exchange rates. However, for the first time since second quarter 2014, the U.S. dollar spot rate weakened versus all 3 of our Latin American currencies during the quarter. This was a benefit to assets under management as foreign exchange for assets under management is translated on a spot rate basis. 
Over the long term, we continue to align revenue and expense growth to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. Expense initiatives started in the first quarter will benefit earnings in the second half of the year and beyond. 
As shown on Slide 8, reported earnings per share were $0.97 for first quarter 2016, an 8% decline compared to the normalized year ago quarter, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate and volatile equity markets. 
At the end of the first quarter, return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustment, was 13.4%. The 160 basis point decline from first quarter 2015 is predominantly due to the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lower prepayment fees. 
Now I'll discuss business unit results starting on Slide 9 with Retirement Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee, businesses. First quarter pretax operating earnings of $114 million were down 17% from the normalized year ago quarter. Quarterly net revenue decreased 6% from the prior year normalized quarter, driven by unfavorable equity market conditions. On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 30%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, pretax return on net revenue was 32%. Given normal market conditions, we are confident our industry-leading margin will continue to be within our previously stated range of 28% to 32% throughout 2016. RIS-Fee had strong net free cash flow of $3 billion in the first quarter. For full year 2016, we still expect net cash flow to be on our stated 1% to 3% range as we continue to strike the right balance of growth and profitability. The balance of strong sales and retention, combined with expected equity market returns and continued expense alignment, should drive a stronger finish to 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings was $67 million, a 10% increase over the year ago quarter. The rise in earnings, which is in line with the 10% growth in the RIS-Spread average account values, was driven by strong sales of all spread products. On a trailing 12-month basis, the normalized pretax return on net revenue was 55% and within our guided range. RIS-Spread continues to perform well as the market volatility has created opportunities as clients welcome guaranteed solutions even in the low interest rate environment. The pipeline remains strong, and we continue to approach the pension closeout and Investment Only businesses opportunistically. 
Turning to Slide 11. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $80 million in the first quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by volatile market performance as well as lower performance and transaction fees in first quarter 2016. The low performance and transaction fees in the first quarter were a result of timing differences as we see good visibility for more normal levels in the remainder of 2016. 
While these performance and transactions fees fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the best measure of our ongoing development in asset management is management fees. These increased slightly from a year ago quarter and increased more than 6% on a trailing 12-month basis in spite of the severe industry headwinds. On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 33% and within our expected range. 
Quarterly net cash flows were a positive $700 million despite the lapse of a $3.3 billion passively managed low-fee currency overlay mandate. The new business pipeline remains strong. 
Slide 12 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International of $68 million. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for encaje performance, Principal International continues to have mid-teens growth in operating earnings. First quarter 2016 encaje performance was $4 million pretax lower than expected, while the year ago quarter benefited $5 million pretax from better-than-expected encaje performance. 
We're continuing to build traction in China. Quarterly pretax operating earnings in China more than tripled over the prior year quarter providing further diversification within Principal International. 
We continue to work with our joint venture partner, China Construction Bank, to develop a diversified product portfolio and provide investment solutions for long-term savings. Compared to the prior year quarter, the strengthening U.S. dollar suppressed Principal International pretax operating earnings by $16 million. Over the trailing 12 months, foreign exchange has reduced Principal International assets under management by $9 billion [ph]. However, strengthening Latin American currencies in the latter part of the first quarter 2016 had a favorable $8 billion [ph] impact on assets under management in the quarter. If sustained, this improved exchange rate could provide a tailwind to next quarter's operating earnings. 
Moving to Slide 13. Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were $39 million. First quarter 2015 was positively impacted by the recovery of reinsurance premiums partially offset by higher expenses. After normalizing prior year results, pretax operating earnings decreased 5%. Growth in the block of business was offset by higher individual disability claims compared to the prior period, which can be volatile in any one quarter. The overall loss ratio for the first quarter was within the targeted range. 
The underlying fundamentals of the business remains strong with record sales and retention and normalized premium and fee growth of 8% as well as double-digit increase in trailing 12-month pretax operating earnings. As a reminder, Specialty Benefits operating earnings are seasonally impacted by higher first quarter dental and vision claims and higher first quarter nondeferred sales-related expenses. Typically, distribution of annual earnings in this business is 20% in the first quarter, 25% in the second and third quarters and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 14, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $42 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% from the prior year period. This was a strong result, leading to pretax margin of 16%, which is at the higher end of our range. Results this quarter were driven by higher interest margins as well as favorable mortality on a growing block of business.  Business market sales remain strong at 56% of total sales in the first quarter. 
Corporate pretax operating losses of $53 million were lower than expected due to timing of some of our funded initiatives. We anticipate full year 2016 corporate pretax operating losses to be at the lower end of our previously announced range of $235 million to $265 million. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $368 million, including net realized capital gains of $82 million. Lower interest rates led to gains of $112 million in our derivative portfolio, partially offset by $30 million of credit-related losses. Our investment portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations as credit stress was isolated to the energy and basic industry sectors. We remain confident in our diversified high-quality investment portfolio. Again, due to our disciplined asset liability management, we are not forced sellers in stressed times. 
As outlined on Slide 15, we continue to target $800 million to $1 billion of capital deployment in 2016. In first quarter 2016, we paid a $0.38 common stock dividend, a strong dividend yield in the current low interest rate environment.  Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.39 per share payable in the second quarter, as we continue to increase our dividend payout ratio. 
In addition, we repurchased $86 million worth of common stock in the first quarter, completing the remainder of our 2015 authorization. In February, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $400 million share repurchase program. $389 million of that authorization remained outstanding at the end of the first quarter. 
We continue to have a balanced approach to capital deployment and consider all options, including dividends, acquisitions, share repurchase and reducing our leverage ratio. 
In the current environment, we view share repurchase as an effective way to increase long-term value for shareholders. Despite the volatile operating environment, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we will continue to focus on things within our control to drive growth and profitability for the long term. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

You'll have seen from Page 3 of the supplement that management fee revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, we show that, and this thing called Other revenue.

You'll have seen from Page 3 of the supplement that management fee revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, we show that, and this thing called Other revenue. The 2 biggest parts of Other revenue are borrower fees on commercial mortgage origination and incentive fees on various strategies from hedge funds to real estate funds to various institutional accounts that have an incentive fee. So those are shown in Other revenues. And you'll see, if you look back at the trailing 12 months, that's been typically, give or take, 20% to 25% of our total revenues of PGI. It's been pretty steady. What's happened during the first quarter is that borrowers on commercial mortgages delayed closing because of market instability. And it so happened, this is partly random actually, that the incentive fees were actually basically 0 in the first quarter. Now the incentive fees can be on a 1-year cycle, a 3-year cycle or be dependent on the realization of the underlying asset. Those are really the 3 ways they tend to operate, and most quarters, we get some. They're, as you know, back-end loaded to the fourth quarter, which is partly why we showed trailing 12-months in the supplement. So this preamble is really a buildup to a couple of numbers I can give you, if I can identify them here in my notes. If you look at the quarter, the year ago quarter, just for example, was a typical 20% Other revenue quarter. We had $264.2 million of management fees and $64.7 million of Other revenue. The quarter just ended that we're reporting on had $265.4 million of management fees. So actually, up slightly on a year ago quarter, but only $44.2 million of Other revenue, as all the phenomena I mentioned were slowing client activities. We have done a pretty thorough bottom-up analysis of what Other revenues will look like during the rest of the year, and we are basically anticipating that the year will be much more typical of the last 2 or 3 years and that really what has happened is a little bit random, but more important, the client activities will pick up again. So we remain pretty perky about what the year as a whole will look like."

The slight depression of margins taking the first quarter on its own was simply due to a relatively low -- an anomalously lower revenues for the reasons I described. We're pretty confident that the 33% to 36% range that we mentioned for return on net revenue in the guidance call in December, that remains a pretty good guide to how we'll look for the year on all current indications. In terms of investment for growth. As you know, we're one of the few global asset managers who's actually growing revenues at the moment. There's a lot of rather vicious industry headwinds. The volumes in new business we're taking on are definitely leading to elevated costs. Both the costs of taking the business on in terms of commission and setup expenses, but also developing our sales force and our ability to serve clients, whether it's different -- whether it's new share classes in mutual funds or new offices internationally, those are all expansionary things we're doing, but they're all costing money. And that's why 33% to 36% remains our guideline, not higher. There are asset managers with higher margins, there's a few, but they're mostly firms who are not growing or even in some cases shrinking. I would rather have our balance, but hope that answers the question, Erik."

As we've talked about in the past, we look at the relationship between our growth and our revenue and our growth and our expenses. We've always tried to have this 1% to 2% differential, i.e., the revenue growing faster than expenses. But when you look back to 2014, as part of the trailing 12 months, and as always, we try to look at it over a longer period of time because of some volatility that could occur in any one particular period, 2014 was a pretty tough comparison because of the strong revenue growth as well as the expenses that we had. So looking at it in terms of more of a sequential basis, you've seen a pretty significant reduction in our expense growth from fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. It's down approximately 5% or $44 million. Now we think that as you go forward, we're going to continue to align our expenses and revenue. And as Jim talked about, he's looking to the future of PGI. We also look across all of our organizations, and we feel more comfortable about the growth rate for the entire year. If you look at 2016 compared to 2015, we'll see that 1% differential in our revenue growth. We think that 2015 is probably a more comparable year. And if you look at expenses in the first quarter of 2016, I'd say that, that's probably more comparable to what you'll see the rest of the year than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. So again, we look at the growth rate of expenses, ensure -- and try to make sure that we get that good comparison with the growth rate of revenues. In any point particular quarter, it's tough to do. As you saw in the first quarter, a significant decline in the equity markets having an impact on our revenue on a short-term basis. Our expenses will catch up with that -- for the rest of the year. Hope that helps."

There's $22 trillion in this country, which arguably would make it the most successful retirement system anywhere in the world. Secondly, the DOL, I believe their intentions are good. When I think about the intent of the law, it's to protect the interest of U.S. retirement savers. It's about creating transparency around cost and benefits and value. It's also about making sure we have access to the competitive marketplace. There are some unintended consequences, and that's what Deanna will respond to in just a minute, relative to working with advisers. There's a view that the Robo solution solves all problems for small account balance holders. That's just not the case, and so we have some more work to do there. The second is we want to make sure that we're not creating barriers that reduce the number of advisers that have in the past and will in the future provide important education to individuals and to savers. And then we also want to make sure that we don't limit the number of individualized solutions that we can present to plan participants. They're very dependent on that enroller, if you will.

In fact, a majority of that systems revenue comes from transactions that aren't impacted by the proposal. Having said that, I think there's a couple of points that I think is important to keep in mind as we think about even those products that do fall under the regulations. First of all, as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, the final regs did allow for a pass-forward on proprietary products, and that applies to both funds within a retirement plan as well as retail products sold at the time of either retirement or when participants change jobs. I think the other thing to keep in mind is our affiliated advisers already today have choice. We have both proprietary and nonproprietary products and solutions, and our proprietary offerings will have to continue to compete on items such as investment performance and service as they do today. So we will have some business model changes for that channel that will come in the realm of compensation changes, like you mentioned, compliance. But I think we're very confident that our business model can adjust and feel good about our ability to comply as well as continue to stay focused on meeting the needs of those customers that we serve."

We're looking for that, what will enhance the shareholder's value. Now buying back shares is one of the options, but we look at all kinds of different things in terms of to enhance shareholder value as well as to distribute that value as it's created. If you look at over the last several years, you'd see we've done a pretty good job of balancing it between our organic growth and acquisitions in order to create shareholder value and then increasing our dividend payout ratio, as we've just increased the dividend again, as we marched towards that 40% of net income. And buybacks is just another part of the program here. And so we talked about, in 2016, $800 million to $1 billion, and we're on track to do that. And we think that, as you mentioned though, that the share buyback program is a very important part of that so far. So through the first quarter, we had $86 million. As of yesterday, we added another $26 million in the program. So we're over $100 million now. We're looking at it long term. We do have a program that gets accelerated as the share price goes lower. Hopefully, we won’t have to worry about that in the near future. But as we look into the second half of the year, we've got options. We've got opportunities to continue to pay out our dividend and increase it towards that 40% payout ratio. We're also looking at acquisition activity for the remainder of the year. And as we've talked about in the past, we've looked at increasing our share of some PGI boutiques, and so we'll look at that as well. We'll also think about the share buyback. So as I've mentioned, we've continued to build that out. And so we've got over $360 million yet in our authorization. So that is a very integral part of the share buyback -- excuse me, of the capital deployment strategy in this environment. And then we're also going to continue to look at opportunities to change our capital structure and reduce our debt leverage because we do have some high-coupon debt out there that we could, if the opportunity presents itself, use that for that. So we're going to continue very balanced, disciplined, long-term approach to our capital deployment strategy. And I think we're well on our way to distributing that $800 million to $1 billion. Hope that helps."

We certainly believe we're striking the right balance, and we think we have the proof points for it. With the kind of plan retention we're seeing, with the kind of the sales we're seeing, we're always looking at -- obviously we've got a competitive market we're dealing in, but one of the things that we're seeing is, in particular in that small to medium, that core segment of our market, we're seeing just a tremendous opportunity for us as we move in that space. And what I -- and what we've seen is, as we look at that growth in our -- both in our sales and retention, that, that's the piece of it that is really outperforming for us. The lumpiness that we talked about or the volatility we talked about comes with 1 or 2 larger cases. So you think in terms of $500 million or north of $500 million. Now oftentimes, when we talk about the discipline between growth and profitability, it's with those larger cases in making a decision that we're not willing to race to the bottom on pricing. So that's the kind of lumpiness you'll see, and that's why we'll have quarters like we had this quarter with a $3 billion really outstanding net cash flow. But we don't want to get over our skis extrapolating that because we will have 1 or 2 large plan decisions over the year that will move that number, which is why we continue to reaffirm the guidance that if we look at a full year rather than quarter-to-quarter, if we look at a full year, we're confident given what we see today that we're going to be well within that 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account value. But the caveat that we always throw out is because our core business is small and medium businesses, when you have 1 or 2 of those larger cases moving in or out, that can swing the numbers, which is why we tend to look full year rather than quarter-to-quarter."

The TRS, the Total Retirement Suite, still is a very, very powerful tool for The Principal that can differentiate value from pure 401(k) players, and so that again is a differentiator. Frozen defined benefits, deferred compensation, ESOP had a nice quarter here. So that is a nice differentiator. The other point I'd make is because it was -- this generalization of large case pricing. There are so many components that go into the pricing of a large plan. How many payroll centers? What's the current penetration rate relative to participant involvement? What's the customized communications package? All of those variables go into it. So when we lose a plan or win a plan, it's because we've done the homework behind the scenes to understand exactly what kind of resources are going to have to be deployed against that plan. So that's why at any given time, you could lose a plan or win a plan. But again, we like the model that we have. We think it resonates in the marketplace, and our retention rates would imply that those large plans appreciate it. Hopefully that helps."

They're going to call into a call center like they always have because that's the typical sort of process. And they're going to be having a conversation with a person providing education and guidance. And they're going to disclose what the pricing is in the current plan structure, in a qualified retirement plan. And it could be larger plan, and there's going to be a certain price. And they're also, as I always have in the past disclosed to them, that there are other options for them to consider. They could move that money to a rollover IRA with the Principal or they could roll over that money to a third party. And the names are common. You would know all of those. And the burden that now falls on the adviser is that the participant has a very clear understanding that they're moving from one product to another. And they have to look at it on a couple of different dimensions. One dimension, of course, is the investment lineup. Is it same or is it different? Another dimension is what's the underlying performance of those investment options? The third dimension is on the price. What am I paying and what am I getting in exchange for that? And it doesn't have to be the same price, but there has to be a thorough understanding and explanation on why there is a difference for the price being paid. That action unto itself is going to take a longer conversation for fully vetting that opportunity. It ties back to my earlier statements that small account balance holders could find that there are fewer advisers willing to invest the time and the energy to vet every one of those situations. So I think there is a likelihood that 401(k) service providers could end up almost by default retaining maybe more of those smaller account balances after they've had that discussion with that phone counselor. I think on the larger account balances, there are advisers that are going to be spending the time to help vet the opportunity. And the last comment I would make is remember that we are a significant player in the rollover business for Defined Contribution Investment Only, where Jim McCaughan's PGI investment products not only find themselves on the platform of many 401(k) chassis, but also they find themselves on rollover IRA chassis. And again, with strong performance and investment options that solve needs for long-term savers, I think that's a net plus. So hopefully, that's not too long winded of an answer, John.

So what happened with our net customer cash flow? You could see our financial supplement, trailing 12 months, we are flying at $9.3 billion in trailing 12 months. We put in $900 million net customer cash flows in the first quarter. If you're looking the trend that we have had during 2015 first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, in the first part of the year, average per quarter $2.5 billion, $3 billion in net customer cash flows; average in the second part of the year, $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion; and then we had $1 billion. But if you're going into the first quarter, I would say that January, February, March, they had a very positive, I would say, behavior.

I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, particularly so given the context of 4 macroeconomic headwinds impacting our businesses: Volatile equity markets, volatile emerging markets and foreign exchange rates, low interest rates, and growing demand for lower-cost investment options. Despite these pressures, over the trailing 12 months, we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in operating earnings, $17 billion of net cash flows and a $33 billion increase in assets under management. 
As shown on Slide 5, strong investment performance remains a key contributor, with 90-plus percent of our Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust above medium for 3- and 5-year performance at the end of the second quarter. These results reflect several others strengths as well. 
I'll briefly share some thoughts on each of them starting with our success managing the right active strategies. While many other active managers are struggling, Principal Global Investors delivered $6.4 billion in positive net cash flows to the first half of 2016. The success reflects our focus on asset allocation, multi-asset, multi-manager strategies and our outcomes-based solutions. While volatile conditions remain, our strong net cash flows reflect strong underlying growth. We benefit again from a diversified business model, but more importantly, from how our businesses are integrated. Retirement and Income Solutions is central to that integration. And our ability to meet customer needs throughout the spectrum of accumulation and retirement income stages. When full-service accumulation grows, it drives enterprise growth. Increasing the pull of retirement assets for Principal Global Investors to manage as well as growth for our retail funds and annuity businesses and, of course, Principal Bank. 
The U.S. retirement industry has a competitive market. That said, we remain highly competitive, and the fundamentals remains strong. We added 1,100 net new defined contribution plans over the trailing 12 months and nearly 100,000 new participants with account values. I'd also point to our exceptional joint venture partners. Despite the severe recession in Brazil, we have nearly $4 billion of positive net cash flows through mid-year, much can be attributed to the relationship with our partner, Banco de Brasil. Another example is our joint venture with China Construction Bank. Over the trailing 12 months, our pretax operating earnings in China have nearly tripled to $34 million while the vast of majority of China's assets under management growth and net cash flows this quarter were institutional and short term in nature, we're building momentum with retail investors. 
A couple additional points on our opportunity in China. First, an update on last quarter's announcement about the memorandum of understanding we signed with China Construction Bank to develop a new pension joint venture. Again, this is a longer-term initiative, but we're already dedicating resources. We're also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to share Principal's pension and asset management expertise with China Construction Bank and build relationship with leadership at their pension company. 
Lastly, as the result of our long-term commitment to China and strong relationship, I have the privilege of participating in the U.S.-China strategic economic dialogue in Beijing in June. This gave me an opportunity to further discuss our commitment to improving retirement readiness in China, and to that end, the importance of Principal obtaining a pension license. 
The last area I will cover is our continued strong track record of execution. Specialty Benefits is a great example. The level and consistency of growth and profitability in this business continues to be industry-leading, reflecting our focus on small- to medium-sized businesses, strong pricing discipline and strong claims management. Strong execution also applies to 3 other areas I've been highlighting with investors: Our solution set, distribution, and customer experience. Here are a few examples that reflect our ongoing effort to evolve the organization in these areas and position Principal for sustainable, profitable growth. 
I'll start with PlanWorks, our retirement readiness plan design. Through the first 6 months of 2016, we've increased the number of PlanWorks contracts by 25% compared to the same period a year ago, and more than doubled the number of additional participants covered. While this is resource-intensive and is accomplished 1 plan at a time, this work is moving the needle in 2 important ways: First, higher participation rates and use of automatic deferral increases is contributing to growth in reoccurring deposits, which are up approximately $500 million through the first 6 months of 2016. Second, better participant outcomes contributed continued strong contract level retention, which is more than 97% through mid-year 2016. 
From a distribution standpoint, we continue to make meaningful progress getting our funds on third-party platforms, model portfolios and recommended list. Through mid-year 2016, we put more than 20 different funds on nearly 20 different platforms, with success across equities, fixed income as well as alternatives. 
Moving to our solution set. In addition to multiple fund launches in the first half of the year, we've positioned multiple offerings for the second half launch. Our global product strategy contemplates opportunities such as accelerating demand for income solutions due to the aging global populations, potential disruption from regulatory changes as well as the trend towards lower cost product structures. 
As one final example, I'll highlight our recent launch of online Individual Life and Individual Disability Insurance purchasing portal. We're already seeing strong interest in the site. It is producing leads in conversion to sales of nearly 10%. This demonstrates the need individuals have for this product and their desire to engage with us to further protect their financial future. 
Before I hand off to Terry, I want to provide a brief update on what we're doing to prepare for the implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. We're making significant progress working with the multiple distribution partners to design an array of best interest solutions and address changing business models. 
As we said last quarter, we believe we'll continue to lead industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Centrally to the final rule, our cross-business unit teams have gained a clear understanding of the cost to cover training and system and product modifications to ensure we can continue to serve advisers and customers post-implementation. We anticipate the increased cost will be approximately $1 million per month over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully implemented, we estimate the annual operational costs associated with the new rule to increase annual expenses by $5 million to $10 million. 
In closing, again, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to position Principal for long-term growth through strong execution and ongoing investments to enhance our competitive position. Terry?"
201105,313906498,1017301,"Principal Financial Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Principal Financial Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income, including performance of the investment portfolio, and I'll close with an update on capital deployment.

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter, net income, including performance of the investment portfolio, and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Our teams delivered strong results in the second quarter, proving once again that our diversified and integrated business model drives results despite some ongoing macroeconomic volatility. 
Second quarter total company after-tax operating earnings were $337 million, the second highest on record. This was a 3% increase compared to the normalized year-ago quarter and an 18% increase over first quarter 2016. 
Now as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to manage the long-term growth rate of expenses in line with revenues and we'll continue to see a positive impact from that in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to second quarter 2015, the S&P daily average was more than 1% lower in second quarter 2016 resulting in lower fee income and impacting earnings on our fee-based businesses. However, compared to the first quarter, the daily average was up 6%. Additionally, persistent low interest rates pressure our spread and risk-based businesses. Although the majority of our earnings come from our fee-based businesses, we are impacted by the low-interest rate environment, and as I'll discuss later in the call, we'll continue to work to mitigate that risk. 
As shown on Slide 6, reported earnings per share were $1.15 for second quarter 2016, a 5% increase over the normalized year-ago quarter. We did not normalize any items in the second quarter as performance fees, claims and encaje performance were all within normal volatility. I'll cover those items in more detail in the business unit sections. 
At the end of the second quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.3%. This was down 140 basis points from the year-ago quarter reflecting flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and lower prepayment activity. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 7 with the RIS-Fee businesses. Second quarter pretax operating earnings were $125 million, down 13% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower fee revenue and lower variable investment income partially offset by diligent expense management. However, we've seen a strong 9% increase from the first quarter reflecting growth in the business, improved market performance and continued expense management. On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 29%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 32% in the second quarter 2016. Despite the ongoing competitiveness of the U.S. retirement market, we remain confident of our opportunities in this business. 
RIS-Fee quarterly net cash flows were flat, reflecting the loss of 1 large client. The pipeline remains strong, and we expect net cash flows to be at the upper end of our stated range of 1% to 3% at the beginning of the year account values. 
Turning to Slide 8. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $70 million, a 2% increase over the normalized prior year quarter. Growth in the business was partially offset by a decline in variable investment income. On a sequential basis, growth in the business and higher variable investment income generated a 4% increase on pretax operating earnings. While Full Service Payout sales were lower in the second quarter compared to a record sales in the prior year quarter, we still have a strong pipeline in our target market. On a trailing 12-month basis, second quarter pretax return on net revenue, after adjusting for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, was 55%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $118 million, a 19% increase over the year-ago quarter and a 47% increase over the first quarter. Performance and transaction fees rebounded from the lower levels in the first quarter. Second quarter's fees are slightly above our long-term quarterly expectations. However, on a year-to-date basis, these fees are in line with our expectations and are a good proxy going forward. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to record assets under management, record operating earnings and positive net cash flows of nearly $6 billion, a contrast from recent trends in the active management space.  
On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 34% in the second quarter, and within our targeted range. 
Slide 10 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International worth $70 million. Second quarter 2016 encaje performance was $5 million lower than expected on a pretax basis within expected volatility.  Compared to the first quarter, operating earnings were up 3% due to the underlying growth of the business. Foreign currency tailwinds during the quarter were partially offset by headwinds from Latin American inflation. On a constant-currency basis and adjusting for expected encaje performance, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in operating earnings and revenues. Net cash flows for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong net cash flows within our 2 companies in Brazil: Brasilprev and Claritas. Brasilprev captured 59% of the open pension industry net deposits during the second quarter. And Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, generated $200 million of net cash flows in the quarter, demonstrating its strategic important in this market. Although not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows of $3.2 billion for the quarter, our joint venture in China generated a record $45 billion of net cash flows in the second quarter, but nearly all of the flows were short term in nature and with low basis point fees. These institutional mandates carry no investment guarantees. 
Turning to U.S. Insurance Solutions. It was a strong quarter with pretax operating earnings of $104 million, up 18% over the prior year quarter. We also had nice top line growth with overall sales of 12% and premium and fees, up 7%. 
On Slide 11, Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were a strong $67 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year quarter primarily due to a favorable loss ratio. The loss ratio was driven by a positive claims volatility within our expected range, continued investments in our claims process and technology and strong underwriting and renewal [ph] practices. We expect the Specialty Benefits loss ratio to trend back over the next few quarters towards recent trailing 12-month levels with normal quarterly volatility. Specialty Benefits continues to deliver above-market growth with a 7% increase in premium and fees on a normalized trailing 12-month basis. Normalized pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was very strong on the top end of our targeted range. 
As shown on Slide 12, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, a slight increase over the prior year period as growth was partially offset by slightly higher mortality. Normalized trailing 12-month premium and fee growth of 4% is within the targeted range. We continue to execute on our business market strategy with sales in this market comprising more than half of the total Individual Life sales in the quarter.  After removing the impact of the 2014 and 2015 third quarter actuarial reviews, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15%, reflecting favorable mortality results.  Corporate pretax operating losses were $55 million, reflecting the timing of some funded initiatives. We expect to be at the low end of our full year range. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $322 million, including net realized capital losses of $15 million. Credit-related losses continued to be lower than our long-term expectations at $6 million. 
One [indiscernible] the market has been focused on recently is the potential for an interest rate environment that stays low for a long period of time. With only 4% of our $573 billion of assets under management with a minimum guaranteed interest rate, we believe our exposures are manageable given a business mix that's predominantly fee-based, driving 70% of total company operating earnings, a portfolio of guaranteed businesses that have varying levels of impact from interest rate risks; ongoing derisking activities in the design and distribution of guaranteed products; and disciplined pricing as part of our asset/liability management strategy. 
I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. As outlined on Slide 13, through the second quarter, we've deployed $453 million of capital with the commitment of approximately $118 million for our third quarter common stock dividend. We continue to target $800 million to $1 billion for the full year. Our deployment strategy remains balanced as we look at multiple ways to add long-term value for shareholders. In second quarter 2016, we paid a $0.39 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in the third quarter, a 7% increase over third quarter 2015 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we've repurchased $104 million worth of common stock in the second quarter. We continue to execute on our board authorized $400 million share repurchase program, and as of today, we have $250 million remaining in that program. We also deployed an additional $38 million in the second quarter as we increased our ownership in existing Principal Global Investor boutiques. 
As I started out saying, we continue to benefit from our diversified and integrated business model and volatile macroeconomic environments. Second quarter was another great example of the strong fundamentals of our business as a result of focused execution and disciplined expense management. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

It looks as if the ability of our various people in London to continue to be based will be unimpaired, but that's something we're watching very carefully. That's probably our #1 near-term concern. As regards to clients, Ryan, we have actually seen, if anything, a boost to our business from the tensions within the European Union, if anything, because largely what we're selling is global and dollar-based products, which are extremely attractive in the very low interest rates environment you have in Europe. So Europe has been a pretty good market for us. And even if economies are somewhat negatively impacted by Brexit, both in the Eurozone and in Britain, even if that happens, we would expect to continue to be in a pretty strong position as a fundamentally global and cross-border player."

You've identified the fact that we quarter-over-quarter have the variable investment income down. But what you're asking about is really the gap between account value growth and revenue growth. And this is a gap that's been part of our business for many, many years. I mean, this isn't a new phenomenon. If you look quarter-over-quarter sometimes can be a bit -- it can bounce back and forth. But if you look at a trailing 12-month period over the last many years, you're going to generally see that gap, and this is -- remember, this is a growth gap. You're going to generally see that between 4% and 5%. Sometimes, it's going to be more, sometimes it's going to be less. In a down market, you might see that gap close a bit. But the fact there are many, many factors that are contributing to that in our industry factors. There's product mix changes that you get in your block, there's business mix changes that you get in your block. Obviously, there's investment mix changes there going on in a constant basis, and then there's competitive pricing. So you get -- and I could go and on, there are other factors, but you get the point. There are a number of different factors that are going to impact that delta between the account value growth and the revenue growth.

The first thing I'd say is there's not an across-the-board mandate to reduce expenses.

And that's where our focus is on. So again, not anything across the board, but by business unit, within Jim's operations, Nora's, Deanna's and Luis's as well as across corporate, we're looking at how do we align those expenses for the revenues we're able to create. And it doesn't happen overnight. And I would tell you, we've been at this now for -- it's an ongoing effort, and we're going to continue to focus on that. And at the same time, what I would tell you, if we're making the investments or we need to make investments, we have to make an investment in DOL, we have to make an investment in technology, we have to make sure our products are relevant. Part of the diminution of the revenue stream that Nora mentioned was around investment mix. If someone chooses a collective investment trust that has a similar investment strategy, but the underlying revenue associated with it is less, that's good for the customer, good for the participant, good for the adviser, and we need to recognize we have a little bit less revenue coming in. So this won't go away at the end of this quarter or the next quarter. It's something we're just going to continue to keep top of mind.

Just a couple of comments, and some of this will add on to some of the comments I made in last quarter's results. I think the first thing to keep in mind, as Dan mentioned, we have 1,200 kind of proprietary advisers across the United States. And I think the first thing to remember is they sell across the broad range of products that we offer here in the U.S. And so actually, if you look underneath that, the majority of that systems revenue are actually coming from products that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. That could be, obviously, our life insurance business, disability insurance business, group benefits as well as nonqualified transactions across retirement and PGI. So I think that's the first thing that is great to understand. And then I think underneath that, obviously, the final regs do have a path forward for proprietary products, and even today, our affiliated advisers already have choice between different types of products as well as different proprietary and non-proprietary offerings, and so we think that puts us in a good stead to continue to offer them a competitive set of products and solutions, but also put us in a good stead going forward. I spend a lot of time with these advisers, and I continue to have confidence that they already properly evaluate their customers' needs and make recommendations that are in the best interest of the customer. And I think even though this is going to put some additional compliance and monitoring relative to that, as we leverage the buys [ph] for both our retail and retirement plan business, I do feel that both the current business model of those advisers as well as the processors and training we'll be putting in place, really do provide a path forward for this, part of the business and how it interacts with all of our product solutions."

And we're actually really, really confident in our ability to work with our alliance partners, because we're out there working with them right now. They're going to make decisions about their business model, and we're ready to execute on that. We've already got a couple of things that are in place. We actually have services and products that are in place that already address the DOL rule, levelized commission structure for the broker-dealers. Most of our brokers already use this levelized comp solution that we have. We've already got a 0 revenue share investment platform for both of our fee-based and commission advisers, and that's where we collect administrative fees from participants directly, another solution under the DOL rule. We already have an integrated third-party investment fiduciary service. So that's an example of a product and service that we've had in place for many years, and that's going to directly address the DOL -- one of the models that many of our advisers may choose to outsource that third-party investment fiduciary piece. We have a number of in-plan solutions. The new option, obviously, for all of us in the industry, is what we call the BIC, the best interest contract. And as we're out there talking to our distribution partners, we're finding that many of them are going to look and probably execute under the BIC. So we're working with them to help design our end of that equation that then hooks into their end of that equation. The platform exception is one other example, pre-packaged investments, we're having discussions around that. So bottom line is, we've got a lot that's already in place, and actually, we've been executing on it for a number of years, and we're out there with our alliance partners. Many, many of them may be leaning to the BIC, and we'll be ready to go on that front."

In the mutual fund business, the adverse impact for the business, generally, will be around moves towards lower cost share classes. And for us, a move to lower cost share classes basically means shared classes without a 12B-1 Fee or a front-end load. But that move has been going on anyway for several years. For example, 70% of our A shares in our mutual fund business are already load waived. So it's a pretty small minority of our mutual funds where we have a front-end loaded. That will eventually go away perhaps accelerated by the implications of the DOL rule. But it's a pretty small amount for us, and currently we're collecting around $5 million annually from the entire front-end load. So that is a pretty modest impact and it will go away gradually. On the 12B-1s, those are basically a pass through for our business. They're a way that advisers get paid and that is passed through by the fund company. So the effect on our of 12B-1s going away should in the end be negligible over the period that happens. So we don't see that as something a big implication. It's all part of the general fee erosion which is happening in mutual funds, which just means we have to get more efficient. I think also I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of opportunities. One is, if you look around at retirement platforms in the industry generally, there may be a move away from poorer performing or less well-designed proprietary products. That will be an opportunity for us to offer our products on a Defined Contribution Investment Only basis. And we are increasing our resources devoted to finding those clients. And secondly, on the efficiency point, I'd remind you, we did a business integration announced early last year of our funds company with Principal Global Investors. That is enabling us to grow the business without adding add [ph] cost. It wasn't done as a cost take out [ph], we haven't have any reduction enforced consequent on that integration. But it's an opportunity for us to gradually redeploy people, become more efficient, and actually, do more business with our existing teams."

So having said that, in the last quarter, instead of to loan money, which is going into bank deposits, they decided to invest that money in short-term fixed income and they moved that money essentially into our JV, our asset management company. So that is the -- I mean the source of that money is better source of that money. And having said that, we -- that is why we got $45 billion in net customer cash flows, that's in China. But none of that money is -- that money that I mentioned to you coming from CCB bank. Out of that, $2 million or $3 billion are a part of our underlying long-term savings mutual fund retail business. So that is essentially from where that money is coming from."

We'd look at this as a balanced approach of capital deployment to our long-term shareholder strategy and value. Most of our businesses, like we talked about in the past, are fee-based businesses, which generates a lot more of that capital -- earnings that are available. As you'd look at that $800 million to $1 billion, we've already made a pretty good dent in it already in terms of capital that we've deployed in the first half of the year as well as we've committed to. We announced our increase in the third quarter dividend up to $0.41, we're pleased with that. We're progressing towards that 40% payout ratio. We're continuing to move towards that. The acquisitions, we put more into the boutique strategy, which is part of our long-term strategy, buying part of the additional shares of the Finisterre origin, CCI as well as Claritas, that's a good consistent process that we've been having in place for a long time. The share buyback program, you're aware that we had a $400 million authorization in February. We're executing on that. As I've stated in the comments that we've executed, we still have $250 million of our authorization going forward. And so far, what we've deployed and committed is over $600 million. And so far. Now we have options for the rest of the year, we're -- hopefully, we'll pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter, which we assume will happen. And M&A activity, we're always looking for options and opportunities there. Share buybacks, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, $250 million of that authorization. With the low interest rate environment right now, Suneet, there's some opportunities, there's some opportunities to actually execute on some of our debt maturities that we have coming up. We have in 2017, we have $300 million, and that's at a 1.8% coupon. 2019, we have a $350 million, which is at a high 8 7/8% coupon. So we have an opportunity to actually execute on that, enhance the overall return of the organization and reduce our leverage ratio. As right now, we're under 24%, we're marching towards 20%. So we have options. Now are we going to exceed that $1 billion? No, I can't say at this point in time, because, as I mentioned, share buybacks and some of those opportunities will continue to unfold as the year goes on. But if you look back to last year, if you look back to 2015, we said that $800 million to $1 billion, and we were a little bit over that at a billion 17 million dollars [ph] which was about 90% of our net income. So we're continuing to deploy capital in what we believe is a balanced approach to enhance the long-term shareholder values. So stay tuned."

I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, part",1150,"Thank you, John. I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. 
I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, particularly so given the context of 4 macroeconomic headwinds impacting our businesses: volatile equity markets, volatile emerging markets and foreign exchange rates, low interest rates and growing demand for lower-cost investment options. 
Despite these pressures, over the trailing 12 months, we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in operating earnings, $17 billion of net cash flows and a $33 billion increase in assets under management. 
As shown on Slide 5, strong investment performance remains a key contributor, with 90-plus percent of our Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust above median for 3- and 5-year performance at the end of the second quarter. These results reflect several other strengths as well. 
I'll briefly share some thoughts on each of them, starting with our success managing the right active strategies. While many other active managers are struggling, Principal Global Investors delivered $6.4 billion in positive net cash flows through the first half of 2016. The success reflects our focus on asset allocation, multi-asset, multi-manager strategies and our outcomes-based solutions. 
While volatile conditions remain, our strong net cash flows reflect strong underlying growth. We benefit, again, from a diversified business model, but more importantly, from how our businesses are integrated. 
Retirement and Income Solutions is central to that integration and our ability to meet customer needs throughout the spectrum of accumulation and retirement income stages. When Full Service Accumulation grows, it drives enterprise growth, increasing the pool of retirement assets for Principal Global Investors to manage as well as growth for our retail funds and annuity businesses and, of course, Principal Bank. 
The U.S. retirement industry is a competitive market. That said, we remain highly competitive, and the fundamentals remains strong. We added 1,100 net new defined contribution plans over the trailing 12 months and nearly 100,000 new participants with account values. 
I'd also point to our exceptional joint venture partners. Despite the severe recession in Brazil, we have nearly $4 billion of positive net cash flows through mid-year, much can be attributed to the relationship with our partner, Banco do Brasil. 
Another example is our joint venture with China Construction Bank. Over the trailing 12 months, our pretax operating earnings in China have nearly tripled to $34 million. While the vast majority of China's assets under management growth and net cash flows this quarter were institutional and short term in nature, we're building momentum with retail investors. 
A couple additional points on our opportunity in China. First, an update on last quarter's announcement about the memorandum of understanding we signed with China Construction Bank to develop a new pension joint venture. Again, this is a longer-term initiative, but we're already dedicating resources. We're also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to share Principal's pension and asset management expertise with China Construction Bank and build relationships with leadership at their pension company. 
Lastly, as the result of our long-term commitment to China and strong relationship, I have the privilege of participating in the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing in June. This gave me an opportunity to further discuss our commitment to improving retirement readiness in China and to that end, the importance of Principal obtaining a pension license. 
The last area I will cover is our continued strong track record of execution. Specialty Benefits is a great example. The level and consistency of growth and profitability in this business continues to be industry-leading, reflecting our focus on small- to medium-sized businesses, strong pricing discipline and strong claims management. 
Strong execution also applies to 3 other areas I've been highlighting with investors: our solution set, distribution and customer experience. Here are a few examples that reflect our ongoing effort to evolve the organization in these areas and position Principal for sustainable, profitable growth. 
I'll start with PlanWorks, our retirement readiness plan design. Through the first 6 months of 2016, we've increased the number of PlanWorks contracts by 25% compared to the same period a year ago and more than double the number of additional participants covered. While this is resource-intensive and is accomplished one plan at a time, this work is moving the needle in 2 important ways: First, higher participation rates and use of automatic deferral increases is contributing to growth in reoccurring deposits, which are up approximately $500 million through the first 6 months of 2016. Second, better participant outcomes contribute to continued strong contract-level retention, which is more than 97% through mid-year 2016. 
From a distribution standpoint, we continue to make meaningful progress getting our funds on third-party platforms, model portfolios and recommended list. Through mid-year 2016, we put more than 20 different funds on nearly 20 different platforms, with success across equities, fixed income as well as alternatives. 
Moving to our solution set. In addition to multiple fund launches in the first half of the year, we positioned multiple offerings for the second half launch. Our global product strategy contemplates opportunities, such as accelerating demand for income solutions due to the aging global populations, potential disruption from regulatory changes as well as the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
As one final example, I'll highlight our recent launch of online individual life and individual disability insurance purchasing portal. We're already seeing strong interest in the site. It is producing leads and conversion to sales of nearly 10%. This demonstrates the need individuals have for these products and their desire to engage with us to further protect their financial future. 
Before I hand off to Terry, I want to provide a brief update on work we're doing to prepare for the implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. We're making significant progress working with multiple distribution partners to design an array of best-interest solutions and address changing business models. 
As we said last quarter, we believe we'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Centrally to the final rule, our cross-business unit teams have gained a clearer understanding of the cost to cover training and system and product modifications to ensure we can continue to serve advisers and customers post-implementation. We anticipate the increased cost will be approximately $1 million per month over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully implemented, we estimate the annual operational costs associated with the new rule to increase annual expenses by $5 million to $10 million. 
In closing, again, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to position Principal for long-term growth through strong execution and ongoing investments to enhance our competitive position. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. Our teams delivered strong results in the second",1588,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Our teams delivered strong results in the second quarter, proving once again that our diversified and integrated business model drives results despite some ongoing macroeconomic volatility. 
Second quarter total company after-tax operating earnings were $337 million, the second highest on record. This was a 3% increase compared to the normalized year ago quarter and an 18% increase over first quarter 2016. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to manage the long-term growth rate of expenses in line with revenues, and we'll continue to see a positive impact from that in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to second quarter 2015, the S&P daily average was more than 1% lower in second quarter 2016, resulting in lower fee income and impacting earnings on our fee-based businesses. However, compared to the first quarter, the daily average was up 6%. 
Additionally, persistent low interest rates pressure our spread and risk-based businesses. Although the majority of our earnings come from our fee-based businesses, we are impacted by the low-interest rate environment, and as I'll discuss later in the call, we'll continue to work to mitigate that risk. 
As shown on Slide 6, reported earnings per share were $1.15 for second quarter 2016, a 5% increase over the normalized year ago quarter. We did not normalize any items in the second quarter as performance fees, claims and encaje performance were all within normal volatility. I'll cover those items in more detail in the business unit sections. 
At the end of the second quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.3%. This was down 140 basis points from the year ago quarter, reflecting flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and lower prepayment activity. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 7 with the RIS-Fee businesses. Second quarter pretax operating earnings were $125 million, down 13% from the year ago quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower fee revenue and lower variable investment income, partially offset by diligent expense management. 
However, we've seen a strong 9% increase from the first quarter, reflecting growth in the business, improved market performance and continued expense management. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 29%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 32% in second quarter 2016. Despite the ongoing competitiveness of the U.S. retirement market, we remain confident of our opportunities in this business. 
RIS-Fee quarterly net cash flows were flat, reflecting the loss of one large client. The pipeline remains strong, and we expect net cash flows to be at the upper end of our stated range of 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account values. 
Turning to Slide 8. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $70 million, a 2% increase over the normalized prior year quarter. Growth in the business was partially offset by decline in variable investment income. On a sequential basis, growth in the business and higher variable investment income generated a 4% increase on pretax operating earnings. 
While Full Service Payout sales were lower in the second quarter compared to record sales in the prior year quarter, we still have a strong pipeline in our target market. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, second quarter pretax return on net revenue, after adjusting for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, was 55%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $118 million, a 19% increase over the year ago quarter and a 47% increase over the first quarter. Performance and transaction fees rebounded from the lower levels in the first quarter. Second quarter's fees are slightly above our long-term quarterly expectations. However, on a year-to-date basis, these fees are in line with our expectations and are a good proxy going forward. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to record assets under management, record operating earnings and positive net cash flows of nearly $6 billion, a contrast from recent trends in the active management space.  
On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 34% in the second quarter, and within our targeted range. 
Slide 10 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International worth $70 million. Second quarter 2016 encaje performance was $5 million lower than expected on a pretax basis, within expected volatility.  Compared to the first quarter, operating earnings were up 3% due to the underlying growth of the business. Foreign currency tailwinds during the quarter were partially offset by headwinds from Latin American inflation. 
On a constant currency basis and adjusting for expected encaje performance, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in operating earnings and revenues. Net cash flows for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong net cash flows within our 2 companies in Brazil: Brasilprev and Claritas. Brasilprev captured 59% of the open pension industry net deposits during the second quarter. And Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, generated $200 million of net cash flows in the quarter, demonstrating its strategic importance in this market. 
Although not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows of $3.2 billion for the quarter, our joint venture in China generated a record $45 billion of net cash flows in the second quarter, but nearly all of the flows were short term in nature and with low basis point fees. These institutional mandates carry no investment guarantees. 
Turning to U.S. Insurance Solutions. It was a strong quarter, with pretax operating earnings of $104 million, up 18% over the prior year quarter. We also had nice top line growth with overall sales of 12% and premium and fees up 7%. 
On Slide 11, Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were a strong $67 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a favorable loss ratio. The loss ratio was driven by positive claims volatility within our expected range, continued investments in our claims process and technology and strong underwriting and renewal practices. We expect the Specialty Benefits loss ratio to trend back over the next few quarters towards recent trailing 12-month levels with normal quarterly volatility. 
Specialty Benefits continues to deliver above-market growth with a 7% increase in premium and fees on a normalized trailing 12-month basis. Normalized pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was very strong, at the top end of targeted range. 
As shown on Slide 12, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, a slight increase over the prior year period as growth was partially offset by slightly higher mortality. Normalized trailing 12-month premium and fee growth of 4% is within the targeted range. We continue to execute on our business market strategy with sales in this market comprising more than half of the total Individual Life sales in the quarter.  
After removing the impact of the 2014 and 2015 third quarter actuarial reviews, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15%, reflecting favorable mortality results.  Corporate pretax operating losses were $55 million, reflecting the timing of some funded initiatives. We expect to be at the low end of our full year range. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $322 million, including net realized capital losses of $15 million. Credit-related losses continued to be lower than our long-term expectations at $6 million. 
One risk the market has been focused on recently is the potential for an interest rate environment that stays low for a long period of time. With only 4% of our $573 billion of assets under management with a minimum guaranteed interest rate, we believe our exposures are manageable, given a business mix that's predominantly fee-based, driving 70% of total company operating earnings; a portfolio of guaranteed businesses that have varying levels of impact from interest rate risks; ongoing derisking activities in the design and distribution of guaranteed products; and disciplined pricing as part of our asset/liability management strategy. 
I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. As outlined on Slide 13, through the second quarter, we've deployed $453 million of capital with a commitment of approximately $118 million for third quarter common stock dividend. We continue to target $800 million to $1 billion for the full year. Our deployment strategy remains balanced as we look at multiple ways to add long-term value for shareholders. 
In second quarter 2016, we paid a $0.39 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in the third quarter, a 7% increase over third quarter 2015 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we repurchased $104 million worth of common stock in the second quarter. We continue to execute on our board authorized $400 million share repurchase program, and as of today, we have $250 million remaining in that program. We also deployed an additional $38 million in the second quarter as we increased our ownership in existing Principal Global Investor boutiques. 
As I started out saying, we continue to benefit from our diversified and integrated business model and volatile macroeconomic environments. Second quarter was another great example of the strong fundamentals of our business as a result of focused execution and disciplined expense management. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

First thing is on Brexit is we have a very substantial operation in London, so that could be affected longer term depending on how, over the next 2 or 3 years, the Brexit negotiations go. But our main international fund product is domiciled in Dublin, which will remain part of the European Union. So we have our investment adviser and mutual funds domiciled in Dublin. That will allow us access throughout Europe almost regardless of how the negotiations go. We also, in the European Union, just for completeness of offices in Munich, Amsterdam and Malta, all of which give us some flexibility about how we will domicile and manage different businesses depending on how the negotiations go. So we feel pretty well protected here. Our first concern is we have many nationalities in London. It looks as if the ability of our various people in London to continue to be based there will be unimpaired, but that's something we're watching very carefully. That's probably our #1 near-term concern. As regards to clients, Ryan, we have actually seen, if anything, a boost to our business from the tensions within the European Union, if anything, because largely what we're selling is global and dollar-based products, which are extremely attractive in the very low interest rates environment you have in Europe. So Europe has been a pretty good market for us. And even if economies are somewhat negatively impacted by Brexit, both in the Eurozone and in Britain, even if that happens, we would expect to continue to be in a pretty strong position as a fundamentally global and cross-border player."

And particularly, we have been able to see a very important rebound in our activity in Banco do Brasil, particularly Brazilians continue saving money for their long-term saving needs and retirement needs. So it's very clear as well that for long time, the Brazilian government is going to be unable to put together some kind of a strong pillar 1 for pensions. So both repensions and open pension companies are going to continue playing a very important role in that country. So we remain very optimistic about our business in Brazil."

You've identified the fact that we quarter-over-quarter have variable investment income down. But what you're asking about is really the gap between account value growth and revenue growth. And this is a gap that's been part of our business for many, many years. I mean, this isn't a new phenomenon. If you look, quarter-over-quarter sometimes can be a bit -- it can bounce back and forth. But if you look at a trailing 12-month period over the last many years, you're going to generally see that gap, and this is -- remember, this is a growth gap. You're going to generally see that between 4% and 5%. Sometimes, it's going to be more. Sometimes it's going to be less. In a down market, you might see that gap close a bit. But the fact there are many, many factors that are contributing to that, and they're industry factors. There's product mix changes that you get in your block. There's business mix changes that you get in your block. Obviously, there's investment mix changes there going on in a constant basis, and then there's competitive pricing. So you get -- and I could go and on. There are other factors, but you get the point. There are a number of different factors that are going to impact that delta between the account value growth and the revenue growth. And we're seeing the impact of that, as is everybody in the industry."

The first thing I'd say is there's not an across-the-board mandate to reduce expenses. What we've tried to always do -- Larry did it. Barry did it.

So again, not anything across-the-board, but by business unit, within Jim's operations, Nora's and Deanna's and Luis' as well as across corporate. We're looking at how do we align those expenses for the revenues we're able to create. And it doesn't happen overnight. And I would tell you, we've been at this now for -- it's an ongoing effort, and we're going to continue to focus on that. And at the same time, what I would tell you is we're making the investments where we need to make investments. We have to make an investment in DOL. We have to make an investment in technology. We have to make sure our products are relevant. Part of the diminution of the revenue stream that Nora mentioned was around investment mix. If someone chooses a collective investment trust that has a similar investment strategy, but the underlying revenue associated with it is less, that's good for the customer, good for the participant, good for the adviser, and we need to recognize we have a little bit less revenue coming in. So this won't go away at the end of this quarter or the next quarter. It's something we're just going to continue to keep top of mind, and at same time, never put the mission and the strategy of the organization at risk. Is that helpful?"

Just a couple of comments, and some of this will add on to some of the comments I made in last quarter's results. I think the first thing to keep in mind, as Dan mentioned, we have 1,200 kind of proprietary advisers across the United States. And I think the first thing to remember is they sell across the broad range of products that we offer here in the U.S. And so actually, if you look underneath that, the majority of that systems revenue are actually coming from products that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. That could be, obviously, our life insurance business, disability insurance business, group benefits as well as nonqualified transactions across retirement in PGI. So I think that's the first thing that is great to understand. And then I think underneath that, obviously, the final regs do have a path forward for proprietary products. And even today, our affiliated advisers already have choice between different types of products as well as different proprietary and nonproprietary offerings. And so we think that puts us in a good stead to continue to offer them a competitive set of products and solutions, but also put us in a good stead going forward. I spend a lot of time with these advisers, and I continue to have confidence that they already properly evaluate their customers' needs and make recommendations that are in the best interest of the customer. And I think even though this is going to put some additional compliance and monitoring relative to that, as we leverage the bias for both our retail and retirement plan business, I do feel that both the current business model of those advisers as well as the processes and training we'll be putting in place really do provide a path forward for this part of the business and how it interacts with all of our product solutions."

And we're actually really, really confident in our ability to work with our alliance partners because we're out there working with them right now. They're going to make decisions about their business model, and we're ready to execute on that. We've already got a couple of things that are in place. We actually have services and products that are in place that already address the DOL rule, levelized commission structure for the broker-dealers. Most of our brokers already use this levelized comp solution that we have. We've already got a 0 revenue share investment platform for both of our fee-based and commission advisers, and that's where we collect administrative fees from participants directly, another solution under the DOL rule. We already have an integrated third-party investment fiduciary service. So that's an example of a product and service that we've had in place for many years, and that's going to directly address the DOL, one of the models that many of our advisers may choose to outsource that third-party investment fiduciary piece. We have a number of in-plan solutions. The new option, obviously, for all of us in the industry, is what we call the BIC, the best interest contract. And as we're out there talking to our distribution partners, we're finding that many of them are going to look and probably execute under the BIC. So we're working with them to help design our end of that equation that then hooks into their end of that equation. The platform exception is one other example. Prepackaged investments, we're having discussions around that. So bottom line is we've got a lot that's already in place, and actually, we've been executing on it for a number of years, and we're out there with our alliance partners. Many, many of them may be leaning to the BIC, and we'll be ready to go on that front."

In the mutual fund business, the adverse impact for the business, generally, will be around moves towards lower-cost share classes. And for us, a move to lower-cost share classes basically means share classes without a 12b-1 fee or a front-end load. But that move has been going on anyway for several years. For example, 70% of our A shares in our mutual fund business are already load waived. So it's a pretty small minority of our mutual funds where we have a front-end load. That will eventually go away, perhaps accelerated by the implications of the DOL rule. But it's a pretty small amount for us, and currently, we're collecting around $5 million annually from the entire front-end loads. So that is a pretty modest impact and it will go away gradually. On the 12b-1s, those are basically a pass-through for our business. They're a way that advisers get paid and that is passed through by the fund company. So the effect on -- of 12b-1s going away should in the end be negligible over the period it happens. So we don't see that as having a big implication. It's all part of the general fee erosion which is happening in mutual funds, which just means we have to get more efficient. I think also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of opportunities. One is if you look around at retirement platforms in the industry generally, there may be a move away from poorer performing or less well-designed proprietary products. That will be an opportunity for us to offer our products on a Defined Contribution, Investment Only basis, and we are increasing our resources devoted to finding those clients. And secondly, on the efficiency point, I'd remind you, we did a business integration announced early last year of our funds company with Principal Global Investors. That is enabling us to grow the business without adding costs. It wasn't done as a cost take-up. We haven't had any reduction in force consequent on that integration. But it's an opportunity for us to gradually redeploy people, become more efficient and actually do more business with our existing team."

The second is, as you heard from Deanna and Nora and Jim, a lot of this has to do with adapting current product to retrofit it to work with the marketplace. So it's not going to require a refiling. A lot of what we have is going to be able to be modified to work. And then lastly, I would tell you, we're on our front foot in working with our distribution partners. They embrace the conversation. They want to have the conversation, and we're feeling pretty optimistic about how we can work our way through the deal or reg. Any additional comments?"

We'd look at this as a balanced approach of capital deployment to our long-term shareholder strategy and value. Most of our businesses, like we talked about in the past, are fee-based businesses, which generates a lot more of that capital -- earnings that are available. As you look at that $800 million to $1 billion, we've already made a pretty good dent in it already in terms of capital that we've deployed in the first half of the year as well as we committed to. We announced our increase in the third quarter dividend up to $0.41. We're pleased with that. We're progressing towards that 40% payout ratio. We're continuing to move towards that. We -- acquisitions, we put more into the boutique strategy, which is part of our long-term strategy, buying part of additional shares of Finisterre, Origin, CCI as well as Claritas. That's a good, consistent process that we've been having in place for a long time. The share buyback program, you're aware that we had a $400 million authorization in February. We're executing on that. As I stated in the comments that we've executed -- we still have $250 million of authorization going forward. And so far, what we've deployed and committed is over $600 million, in so far. Now we have options for the rest of the year, where hopefully, we'll pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter, which we assume will happen. In M&A activity, we're always looking for options and opportunities there. Share buybacks, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, $250 million of that authorization. With the low interest rate environment right now, Suneet, there's some opportunities. There's some opportunities to actually execute on some of our debt maturities that we have coming up. We have in 2017, we have $300 million, and that's at a 1.8% coupon. 2019, we have a $350 million, which is at a high 8 7/8% coupon. So we have an opportunity to actually execute on that, enhance the overall return of the organization and reduce our leverage ratio. As right now, we're under 24%. We're marching towards 20%. So we have options. Now are we going to exceed that $1 billion? No, I can't say at this point in time because, as I mentioned, share buybacks and some of those opportunities will continue to unfold as the year goes on. But if you look back to last year, if you look back to 2015, we said that $800 million to $1 billion, and we were a little bit over that at $1,070,000,000,  which was about 90% of our net income. So we're continuing to deploy capital in what we believe is a balanced approach to enhance the long-term shareholder value. So stay tuned."

I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, part",1150,"Thank you, John. I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. 
I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, particularly so given the context of 4 macroeconomic headwinds impacting our businesses: volatile equity markets, volatile emerging markets and foreign exchange rates, low interest rates and growing demand for lower-cost investment options. 
Despite these pressures, over the trailing 12 months, we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in operating earnings, $17 billion of net cash flows and a $33 billion increase in assets under management. 
As shown on Slide 5, strong investment performance remains a key contributor, with 90-plus percent of our Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust above median for 3- and 5-year performance at the end of the second quarter. These results reflect several other strengths as well. 
I'll briefly share some thoughts on each of them, starting with our success managing the right active strategies. While many other active managers are struggling, Principal Global Investors delivered $6.4 billion in positive net cash flows through the first half of 2016. The success reflects our focus on asset allocation, multi-asset, multi-manager strategies and our outcomes-based solutions. 
While volatile conditions remain, our strong net cash flows reflect strong underlying growth. We benefit, again, from a diversified business model, but more importantly, from how our businesses are integrated. 
Retirement and Income Solutions is central to that integration and our ability to meet customer needs throughout the spectrum of accumulation and retirement income stages. When Full Service Accumulation grows, it drives enterprise growth, increasing the pool of retirement assets for Principal Global Investors to manage as well as growth for our retail funds and annuity businesses and, of course, Principal Bank. 
The U.S. retirement industry is a competitive market. That said, we remain highly competitive, and the fundamentals remains strong. We added 1,100 net new defined contribution plans over the trailing 12 months and nearly 100,000 new participants with account values. 
I'd also point to our exceptional joint venture partners. Despite the severe recession in Brazil, we have nearly $4 billion of positive net cash flows through mid-year, much can be attributed to the relationship with our partner, Banco do Brasil. 
Another example is our joint venture with China Construction Bank. Over the trailing 12 months, our pretax operating earnings in China have nearly tripled to $34 million. While the vast majority of China's assets under management growth and net cash flows this quarter were institutional and short term in nature, we're building momentum with retail investors. 
A couple additional points on our opportunity in China. First, an update on last quarter's announcement about the memorandum of understanding we signed with China Construction Bank to develop a new pension joint venture. Again, this is a longer-term initiative, but we're already dedicating resources. We're also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to share Principal's pension and asset management expertise with China Construction Bank and build relationships with leadership at their pension company. 
Lastly, as the result of our long-term commitment to China and strong relationship, I have the privilege of participating in the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing in June. This gave me an opportunity to further discuss our commitment to improving retirement readiness in China and to that end, the importance of Principal obtaining a pension license. 
The last area I will cover is our continued strong track record of execution. Specialty Benefits is a great example. The level and consistency of growth and profitability in this business continues to be industry-leading, reflecting our focus on small- to medium-sized businesses, strong pricing discipline and strong claims management. 
Strong execution also applies to 3 other areas I've been highlighting with investors: our solution set, distribution and customer experience. Here are a few examples that reflect our ongoing effort to evolve the organization in these areas and position Principal for sustainable, profitable growth. 
I'll start with PlanWorks, our retirement readiness plan design. Through the first 6 months of 2016, we've increased the number of PlanWorks contracts by 25% compared to the same period a year ago and more than double the number of additional participants covered. While this is resource-intensive and is accomplished one plan at a time, this work is moving the needle in 2 important ways: First, higher participation rates and use of automatic deferral increases is contributing to growth in reoccurring deposits, which are up approximately $500 million through the first 6 months of 2016. Second, better participant outcomes contribute to continued strong contract-level retention, which is more than 97% through mid-year 2016. 
From a distribution standpoint, we continue to make meaningful progress getting our funds on third-party platforms, model portfolios and recommended list. Through mid-year 2016, we put more than 20 different funds on nearly 20 different platforms, with success across equities, fixed income as well as alternatives. 
Moving to our solution set. In addition to multiple fund launches in the first half of the year, we positioned multiple offerings for the second half launch. Our global product strategy contemplates opportunities, such as accelerating demand for income solutions due to the aging global populations, potential disruption from regulatory changes as well as the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
As one final example, I'll highlight our recent launch of online individual life and individual disability insurance purchasing portal. We're already seeing strong interest in the site. It is producing leads and conversion to sales of nearly 10%. This demonstrates the need individuals have for these products and their desire to engage with us to further protect their financial future. 
Before I hand off to Terry, I want to provide a brief update on work we're doing to prepare for the implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. We're making significant progress working with multiple distribution partners to design an array of best-interest solutions and address changing business models. 
As we said last quarter, we believe we'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Centrally to the final rule, our cross-business unit teams have gained a clearer understanding of the cost to cover training and system and product modifications to ensure we can continue to serve advisers and customers post-implementation. We anticipate the increased cost will be approximately $1 million per month over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully implemented, we estimate the annual operational costs associated with the new rule to increase annual expenses by $5 million to $10 million. 
In closing, again, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to position Principal for long-term growth through strong execution and ongoing investments to enhance our competitive position. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. Our teams delivered strong results in the second",1588,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Our teams delivered strong results in the second quarter, proving once again that our diversified and integrated business model drives results despite some ongoing macroeconomic volatility. 
Second quarter total company after-tax operating earnings were $337 million, the second highest on record. This was a 3% increase compared to the normalized year ago quarter and an 18% increase over first quarter 2016. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to manage the long-term growth rate of expenses in line with revenues, and we'll continue to see a positive impact from that in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to second quarter 2015, the S&P daily average was more than 1% lower in second quarter 2016, resulting in lower fee income and impacting earnings on our fee-based businesses. However, compared to the first quarter, the daily average was up 6%. 
Additionally, persistent low interest rates pressure our spread and risk-based businesses. Although the majority of our earnings come from our fee-based businesses, we are impacted by the low-interest rate environment, and as I'll discuss later in the call, we'll continue to work to mitigate that risk. 
As shown on Slide 6, reported earnings per share were $1.15 for second quarter 2016, a 5% increase over the normalized year ago quarter. We did not normalize any items in the second quarter as performance fees, claims and encaje performance were all within normal volatility. I'll cover those items in more detail in the business unit sections. 
At the end of the second quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.3%. This was down 140 basis points from the year ago quarter, reflecting flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and lower prepayment activity. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 7 with the RIS-Fee businesses. Second quarter pretax operating earnings were $125 million, down 13% from the year ago quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower fee revenue and lower variable investment income, partially offset by diligent expense management. 
However, we've seen a strong 9% increase from the first quarter, reflecting growth in the business, improved market performance and continued expense management. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 29%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 32% in second quarter 2016. Despite the ongoing competitiveness of the U.S. retirement market, we remain confident of our opportunities in this business. 
RIS-Fee quarterly net cash flows were flat, reflecting the loss of one large client. The pipeline remains strong, and we expect net cash flows to be at the upper end of our stated range of 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account values. 
Turning to Slide 8. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $70 million, a 2% increase over the normalized prior year quarter. Growth in the business was partially offset by decline in variable investment income. On a sequential basis, growth in the business and higher variable investment income generated a 4% increase on pretax operating earnings. 
While Full Service Payout sales were lower in the second quarter compared to record sales in the prior year quarter, we still have a strong pipeline in our target market. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, second quarter pretax return on net revenue, after adjusting for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, was 55%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $118 million, a 19% increase over the year ago quarter and a 47% increase over the first quarter. Performance and transaction fees rebounded from the lower levels in the first quarter. Second quarter's fees are slightly above our long-term quarterly expectations. However, on a year-to-date basis, these fees are in line with our expectations and are a good proxy going forward. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to record assets under management, record operating earnings and positive net cash flows of nearly $6 billion, a contrast from recent trends in the active management space.  
On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 34% in the second quarter, and within our targeted range. 
Slide 10 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International worth $70 million. Second quarter 2016 encaje performance was $5 million lower than expected on a pretax basis, within expected volatility.  Compared to the first quarter, operating earnings were up 3% due to the underlying growth of the business. Foreign currency tailwinds during the quarter were partially offset by headwinds from Latin American inflation. 
On a constant currency basis and adjusting for expected encaje performance, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in operating earnings and revenues. Net cash flows for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong net cash flows within our 2 companies in Brazil: Brasilprev and Claritas. Brasilprev captured 59% of the open pension industry net deposits during the second quarter. And Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, generated $200 million of net cash flows in the quarter, demonstrating its strategic importance in this market. 
Although not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows of $3.2 billion for the quarter, our joint venture in China generated a record $45 billion of net cash flows in the second quarter, but nearly all of the flows were short term in nature and with low basis point fees. These institutional mandates carry no investment guarantees. 
Turning to U.S. Insurance Solutions. It was a strong quarter, with pretax operating earnings of $104 million, up 18% over the prior year quarter. We also had nice top line growth with overall sales of 12% and premium and fees up 7%. 
On Slide 11, Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were a strong $67 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a favorable loss ratio. The loss ratio was driven by positive claims volatility within our expected range, continued investments in our claims process and technology and strong underwriting and renewal practices. We expect the Specialty Benefits loss ratio to trend back over the next few quarters towards recent trailing 12-month levels with normal quarterly volatility. 
Specialty Benefits continues to deliver above-market growth with a 7% increase in premium and fees on a normalized trailing 12-month basis. Normalized pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was very strong, at the top end of targeted range. 
As shown on Slide 12, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, a slight increase over the prior year period as growth was partially offset by slightly higher mortality. Normalized trailing 12-month premium and fee growth of 4% is within the targeted range. We continue to execute on our business market strategy with sales in this market comprising more than half of the total Individual Life sales in the quarter.  
After removing the impact of the 2014 and 2015 third quarter actuarial reviews, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15%, reflecting favorable mortality results.  Corporate pretax operating losses were $55 million, reflecting the timing of some funded initiatives. We expect to be at the low end of our full year range. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $322 million, including net realized capital losses of $15 million. Credit-related losses continued to be lower than our long-term expectations at $6 million. 
One risk the market has been focused on recently is the potential for an interest rate environment that stays low for a long period of time. With only 4% of our $573 billion of assets under management with a minimum guaranteed interest rate, we believe our exposures are manageable, given a business mix that's predominantly fee-based, driving 70% of total company operating earnings; a portfolio of guaranteed businesses that have varying levels of impact from interest rate risks; ongoing derisking activities in the design and distribution of guaranteed products; and disciplined pricing as part of our asset/liability management strategy. 
I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. As outlined on Slide 13, through the second quarter, we've deployed $453 million of capital with a commitment of approximately $118 million for third quarter common stock dividend. We continue to target $800 million to $1 billion for the full year. Our deployment strategy remains balanced as we look at multiple ways to add long-term value for shareholders. 
In second quarter 2016, we paid a $0.39 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in the third quarter, a 7% increase over third quarter 2015 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we repurchased $104 million worth of common stock in the second quarter. We continue to execute on our board authorized $400 million share repurchase program, and as of today, we have $250 million remaining in that program. We also deployed an additional $38 million in the second quarter as we increased our ownership in existing Principal Global Investor boutiques. 
As I started out saying, we continue to benefit from our diversified and integrated business model and volatile macroeconomic environments. Second quarter was another great example of the strong fundamentals of our business as a result of focused execution and disciplined expense management. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

But our main international fund product is domiciled in Dublin, which will remain part of the European Union. So we have our investment adviser and mutual funds domiciled in Dublin. That will allow us access throughout Europe almost regardless of how the negotiations go. We also, in the European Union, just for completeness of offices in Munich, Amsterdam and Malta, all of which give us some flexibility about how we will domicile and manage different businesses depending on how the negotiations go. So we feel pretty well protected here. Our first concern is we have many nationalities in London. It looks as if the ability of our various people in London to continue to be based there will be unimpaired, but that's something we're watching very carefully. That's probably our #1 near-term concern. As regards to clients, Ryan, we have actually seen, if anything, a boost to our business from the tensions within the European Union, if anything, because largely what we're selling is global and dollar-based products, which are extremely attractive in the very low interest rates environment you have in Europe. So Europe has been a pretty good market for us. And even if economies are somewhat negatively impacted by Brexit, both in the Eurozone and in Britain, even if that happens, we would expect to continue to be in a pretty strong position as a fundamentally global and cross-border player."

And particularly, we have been able to see a very important rebound in our activity in Banco do Brasil, particularly Brazilians continue saving money for their long-term saving needs and retirement needs. So it's very clear as well that for long time, the Brazilian government is going to be unable to put together some kind of a strong pillar 1 for pensions.

You've identified the fact that we quarter-over-quarter have variable investment income down. But what you're asking about is really the gap between account value growth and revenue growth. And this is a gap that's been part of our business for many, many years. I mean, this isn't a new phenomenon. If you look, quarter-over-quarter sometimes can be a bit -- it can bounce back and forth. But if you look at a trailing 12-month period over the last many years, you're going to generally see that gap, and this is -- remember, this is a growth gap. You're going to generally see that between 4% and 5%. Sometimes, it's going to be more. Sometimes it's going to be less. In a down market, you might see that gap close a bit. But the fact there are many, many factors that are contributing to that, and they're industry factors. There's product mix changes that you get in your block. There's business mix changes that you get in your block. Obviously, there's investment mix changes there going on in a constant basis, and then there's competitive pricing. So you get -- and I could go and on. There are other factors, but you get the point. There are a number of different factors that are going to impact that delta between the account value growth and the revenue growth.

So again, not anything across-the-board, but by business unit, within Jim's operations, Nora's and Deanna's and Luis' as well as across corporate. We're looking at how do we align those expenses for the revenues we're able to create. And it doesn't happen overnight. And I would tell you, we've been at this now for -- it's an ongoing effort, and we're going to continue to focus on that. And at the same time, what I would tell you is we're making the investments where we need to make investments. We have to make an investment in DOL. We have to make an investment in technology. We have to make sure our products are relevant. Part of the diminution of the revenue stream that Nora mentioned was around investment mix. If someone chooses a collective investment trust that has a similar investment strategy, but the underlying revenue associated with it is less, that's good for the customer, good for the participant, good for the adviser, and we need to recognize we have a little bit less revenue coming in. So this won't go away at the end of this quarter or the next quarter. It's something we're just going to continue to keep top of mind, and at same time, never put the mission and the strategy of the organization at risk. Is that helpful?"

I think about it impacting in 3 different areas. One area, which Deanna will cover, is around Principal Advisor Network, our 1,200 advisers that are out there every day supporting small to medium-sized businesses and their business owners. Nora, in the retirement space, of course, we have impact in our ability to attract, retain rollovers at benefit event for job changers and retirees. And of course, within Jim's organization, we have the mutual fund company, and it certainly could impact DCI as well. So with that, Deanna, you want to make some comments on PAN?"

Just a couple of comments, and some of this will add on to some of the comments I made in last quarter's results. I think the first thing to keep in mind, as Dan mentioned, we have 1,200 kind of proprietary advisers across the United States. And I think the first thing to remember is they sell across the broad range of products that we offer here in the U.S. And so actually, if you look underneath that, the majority of that systems revenue are actually coming from products that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. That could be, obviously, our life insurance business, disability insurance business, group benefits as well as nonqualified transactions across retirement in PGI. So I think that's the first thing that is great to understand. And then I think underneath that, obviously, the final regs do have a path forward for proprietary products. And even today, our affiliated advisers already have choice between different types of products as well as different proprietary and nonproprietary offerings. And so we think that puts us in a good stead to continue to offer them a competitive set of products and solutions, but also put us in a good stead going forward. I spend a lot of time with these advisers, and I continue to have confidence that they already properly evaluate their customers' needs and make recommendations that are in the best interest of the customer. And I think even though this is going to put some additional compliance and monitoring relative to that, as we leverage the bias for both our retail and retirement plan business, I do feel that both the current business model of those advisers as well as the processes and training we'll be putting in place really do provide a path forward for this part of the business and how it interacts with all of our product solutions."

So Mike, you asked about solutions, and I'll look at it through the retirement plan lens. And we're actually really, really confident in our ability to work with our alliance partners because we're out there working with them right now. They're going to make decisions about their business model, and we're ready to execute on that. We've already got a couple of things that are in place. We actually have services and products that are in place that already address the DOL rule, levelized commission structure for the broker-dealers. Most of our brokers already use this levelized comp solution that we have. We've already got a 0 revenue share investment platform for both of our fee-based and commission advisers, and that's where we collect administrative fees from participants directly, another solution under the DOL rule. We already have an integrated third-party investment fiduciary service. So that's an example of a product and service that we've had in place for many years, and that's going to directly address the DOL, one of the models that many of our advisers may choose to outsource that third-party investment fiduciary piece. We have a number of in-plan solutions. The new option, obviously, for all of us in the industry, is what we call the BIC, the best interest contract. And as we're out there talking to our distribution partners, we're finding that many of them are going to look and probably execute under the BIC. So we're working with them to help design our end of that equation that then hooks into their end of that equation. The platform exception is one other example. Prepackaged investments, we're having discussions around that. So bottom line is we've got a lot that's already in place, and actually, we've been executing on it for a number of years, and we're out there with our alliance partners. Many, many of them may be leaning to the BIC, and we'll be ready to go on that front."

In the mutual fund business, the adverse impact for the business, generally, will be around moves towards lower-cost share classes. And for us, a move to lower-cost share classes basically means share classes without a 12b-1 fee or a front-end load. But that move has been going on anyway for several years. For example, 70% of our A shares in our mutual fund business are already load waived. So it's a pretty small minority of our mutual funds where we have a front-end load. That will eventually go away, perhaps accelerated by the implications of the DOL rule. But it's a pretty small amount for us, and currently, we're collecting around $5 million annually from the entire front-end loads. So that is a pretty modest impact and it will go away gradually. On the 12b-1s, those are basically a pass-through for our business. They're a way that advisers get paid and that is passed through by the fund company. So the effect on -- of 12b-1s going away should in the end be negligible over the period it happens. So we don't see that as having a big implication. It's all part of the general fee erosion which is happening in mutual funds, which just means we have to get more efficient. I think also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of opportunities. One is if you look around at retirement platforms in the industry generally, there may be a move away from poorer performing or less well-designed proprietary products. That will be an opportunity for us to offer our products on a Defined Contribution, Investment Only basis, and we are increasing our resources devoted to finding those clients. And secondly, on the efficiency point, I'd remind you, we did a business integration announced early last year of our funds company with Principal Global Investors. That is enabling us to grow the business without adding costs. It wasn't done as a cost take-up. We haven't had any reduction in force consequent on that integration. But it's an opportunity for us to gradually redeploy people, become more efficient and actually do more business with our existing team."

A lot of what we have is going to be able to be modified to work. And then lastly, I would tell you, we're on our front foot in working with our distribution partners. They embrace the conversation.

We'd look at this as a balanced approach of capital deployment to our long-term shareholder strategy and value. Most of our businesses, like we talked about in the past, are fee-based businesses, which generates a lot more of that capital -- earnings that are available. As you look at that $800 million to $1 billion, we've already made a pretty good dent in it already in terms of capital that we've deployed in the first half of the year as well as we committed to. We announced our increase in the third quarter dividend up to $0.41. We're pleased with that. We're progressing towards that 40% payout ratio. We're continuing to move towards that. We -- acquisitions, we put more into the boutique strategy, which is part of our long-term strategy, buying part of additional shares of Finisterre, Origin, CCI as well as Claritas. That's a good, consistent process that we've been having in place for a long time. The share buyback program, you're aware that we had a $400 million authorization in February. We're executing on that. As I stated in the comments that we've executed -- we still have $250 million of authorization going forward. And so far, what we've deployed and committed is over $600 million, in so far. Now we have options for the rest of the year, where hopefully, we'll pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter, which we assume will happen. In M&A activity, we're always looking for options and opportunities there. Share buybacks, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, $250 million of that authorization. With the low interest rate environment right now, Suneet, there's some opportunities. There's some opportunities to actually execute on some of our debt maturities that we have coming up. We have in 2017, we have $300 million, and that's at a 1.8% coupon. 2019, we have a $350 million, which is at a high 8 7/8% coupon. So we have an opportunity to actually execute on that, enhance the overall return of the organization and reduce our leverage ratio. As right now, we're under 24%. We're marching towards 20%. So we have options. Now are we going to exceed that $1 billion? No, I can't say at this point in time because, as I mentioned, share buybacks and some of those opportunities will continue to unfold as the year goes on. But if you look back to last year, if you look back to 2015, we said that $800 million to $1 billion, and we were a little bit over that at $1,070,000,000,  which was about 90% of our net income. So we're continuing to deploy capital in what we believe is a balanced approach to enhance the long-term shareholder value. So stay tuned."

I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, part",1152,"Thank you, John. I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. 
I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, particularly so given the context of 4 macroeconomic headwinds impacting our businesses: volatile equity markets, volatile emerging markets and foreign exchange rates, low interest rates and growing demand for lower-cost investment options. 
Despite these pressures, over the trailing 12 months, we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in operating earnings, $17 billion of net cash flows and a $33 billion increase in assets under management. 
As shown on Slide 5, strong investment performance remains a key contributor, with 90-plus percent of our Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust above median for 3- and 5-year performance at the end of the second quarter. These results reflect several other strengths as well. 
I'll briefly share some thoughts on each of them, starting with our success managing the right active strategies. While many other active managers are struggling, Principal Global Investors delivered $6.4 billion in positive net cash flows through the first half of 2016. The success reflects our focus on asset allocation, multi-asset, multi-manager strategies and our outcomes-based solutions. 
While volatile conditions remain, our strong net cash flows reflect strong underlying growth. We benefit, again, from a diversified business model, but more importantly, from how our businesses are integrated. 
Retirement and Income Solutions is central to that integration and our ability to meet customer needs throughout the spectrum of accumulation and retirement income stages. When Full Service Accumulation grows, it drives enterprise growth, increasing the pool of retirement assets for Principal Global Investors to manage as well as growth for our retail funds and annuity businesses and, of course, Principal Bank. 
The U.S. retirement industry is a competitive market. That said, we remain highly competitive, and the fundamentals remains strong. We added 1,100 net new defined contribution plans over the trailing 12 months and nearly 100,000 new participants with account values. 
I'd also point to our exceptional joint venture partners. Despite the severe recession in Brazil, we have nearly $4 billion of positive net cash flows through mid-year, much can be attributed to the relationship with our partner, Banco do Brasil. 
Another example is our joint venture with China Construction Bank. Over the trailing 12 months, our pretax operating earnings in China have nearly tripled to $34 million. While the vast majority of China's assets under management growth and net cash flows this quarter were institutional and short term in nature, we're building momentum with retail investors. 
A couple additional points on our opportunity in China. First, an update on last quarter's announcement about the memorandum of understanding we signed with China Construction Bank to develop a new pension joint venture. Again, this is a longer-term initiative, but we're already dedicating resources. We're also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to share Principal's pension and asset management expertise with China Construction Bank and build relationships with leadership at their pension company. 
Lastly, as the result of our long-term commitment to China and strong relationship, I had the privilege of participating in the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing in June. This gave me an opportunity to further discuss our commitment to improving retirement readiness in China and, to that end, the importance of Principal obtaining a pension license. 
The last area I will cover is our continued strong track record of execution. Specialty Benefits is a great example. The level and consistency of growth and profitability in this business continues to be industry-leading, reflecting our focus on small- to medium-sized businesses, strong pricing discipline and strong claims management. 
Strong execution also applies to 3 other areas I've been highlighting with investors: our solution set, distribution and customer experience. Here are a few examples that reflect our ongoing effort to evolve the organization in these areas and position Principal for sustainable, profitable growth. 
I'll start with PlanWorks, our retirement readiness plan design. Through the first 6 months of 2016, we've increased the number of PlanWorks contracts by 25% compared to the same period a year ago and more than double the number of additional participants covered. While this is resource-intensive and is accomplished one plan at a time, this work is moving the needle in 2 important ways: First, higher participation rates and use of automatic deferral increases is contributing to growth in reoccurring deposits, which are up approximately $500 million through the first 6 months of 2016. Second, better participant outcomes contribute to continued strong contract-level retention, which is more than 97% through mid-year 2016. 
From a distribution standpoint, we continue to make meaningful progress getting our funds on third-party platforms, model portfolios and recommended lists. Through mid-year 2016, we put more than 20 different funds on nearly 20 different platforms, with success across equities, fixed income as well as alternatives. 
Moving to our solution set. In addition to multiple fund launches in the first half of the year, we positioned multiple offerings for the second half launch. Our global product strategy contemplates opportunities, such as accelerating demand for income solutions due to the aging global populations, potential disruption from regulatory changes as well as the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
As one final example, I'll highlight our recent launch of online individual life and individual disability insurance purchasing portal. We're already seeing strong interest in the site. It is producing leads and conversion to sales of nearly 10%. This demonstrates the need individuals have for these products and their desire to engage with us to further protect their financial future. 
Before I hand off to Terry, I want to provide a brief update on work we're doing to prepare for the implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. We're making significant progress working with multiple distribution partners to design an array of best-interest solutions and address changing business models. 
As we said last quarter, we believe we'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Since the release of the final rule, our cross-business unit teams have gained a clearer understanding of the cost to cover training and system and product modifications to ensure we can continue to serve advisers and customers post-implementation. We anticipate the increased cost will be approximately $1 million per month over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully implemented, we estimate the annual operational costs associated with the new rule to increase annual expenses by $5 million to $10 million. 
In closing, again, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to position Principal for long-term growth through strong execution and ongoing investments to enhance our competitive position. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. Our teams delivered strong results in the second",1590,"Thanks, Dan. This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Our teams delivered strong results in the second quarter, proving once again that our diversified and integrated business model drives results despite some ongoing macroeconomic volatility. 
Second quarter total company after-tax operating earnings were $337 million, the second highest on record. This was a 3% increase compared to the normalized year ago quarter and an 18% increase over first quarter 2016. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to manage the long-term growth rate of expenses in line with revenues, and we'll continue to see a positive impact from that in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to second quarter 2015, the S&P daily average was more than 1% lower in second quarter 2016, resulting in lower fee income and impacting earnings on our fee-based businesses. However, compared to the first quarter, the daily average was up 6%. 
Additionally, persistent low interest rates pressure our spread and risk-based businesses. Although the majority of our earnings come from our fee-based businesses, we are impacted by the low-interest rate environment, and as I'll discuss later in the call, we'll continue to work to mitigate that risk. 
As shown on Slide 6, reported earnings per share were $1.15 for second quarter 2016, a 5% increase over the normalized year ago quarter. We did not normalize any items in the second quarter as performance fees, claims and encaje performance were all within normal volatility. I'll cover those items in more detail in the business unit sections. 
At the end of the second quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.3%. This was down 140 basis points from the year ago quarter, reflecting flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and lower prepayment activity. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 7 with the RIS-Fee businesses. Second quarter pretax operating earnings were $125 million, down 13% from the year ago quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower fee revenue and lower variable investment income, partially offset by diligent expense management. 
However, we've seen a strong 9% increase from the first quarter, reflecting growth in the business, improved market performance and continued expense management. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 29%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 32% in second quarter 2016. Despite the ongoing competitiveness of the U.S. retirement market, we remain confident of our opportunities in this business. 
RIS-Fee quarterly net cash flows were flat, reflecting the loss of one large client. The pipeline remains strong, and we expect net cash flows to be at the upper end of our stated range of 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account values. 
Turning to Slide 8. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $70 million, a 2% increase over the normalized prior year quarter. Growth in the business was partially offset by a decline in variable investment income. On a sequential basis, growth in the business and higher variable investment income generated a 4% increase on pretax operating earnings. 
While Full Service Payout sales were lower in the second quarter compared to record sales in the prior year quarter, we still have a strong pipeline in our target market. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, second quarter pretax return on net revenue, after adjusting for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, was 55%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $118 million, a 19% increase over the year ago quarter and a 47% increase over the first quarter. Performance and transaction fees rebounded from the lower levels in the first quarter. Second quarter's fees are slightly above our long-term quarterly expectations. However, on a year-to-date basis, these fees are in line with our expectations and are a good proxy going forward. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to record assets under management, record operating earnings and positive net cash flows of nearly $6 billion, a contrast from recent trends in the active management space.  
On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 34% in the second quarter, and within our targeted range. 
Slide 10 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International were at $70 million. Second quarter 2016 encaje performance was $5 million lower than expected on a pretax basis, within expected volatility.  Compared to the first quarter, operating earnings were up 3% due to the underlying growth of the business. Foreign currency tailwinds during the quarter were partially offset by headwinds from Latin American inflation. 
On a constant currency basis and adjusting for expected encaje performance, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in operating earnings and revenues. Net cash flows for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong net cash flows within our 2 companies in Brazil: Brasilprev and Claritas. Brasilprev captured 59% of the open pension industry net deposits during the second quarter. And Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, generated $200 million of net cash flows in the quarter, demonstrating its strategic importance in this market. 
Although not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows of $3.2 billion for the quarter, our joint venture in China generated a record $45 billion of net cash flows in the second quarter, but nearly all of the flows were short term in nature and with low basis point fees. These institutional mandates carry no investment guarantees. 
Turning to U.S. Insurance Solutions. It was a strong quarter, with pretax operating earnings of $104 million, up 18% over the prior year quarter. We also had nice top line growth, with overall sales up 12% and premium and fees up 7%. 
On Slide 11, Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were a strong $67 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a favorable loss ratio. The loss ratio was driven by positive claims volatility within our expected range, continued investments in our claims process and technology and strong underwriting and renewal practices. We expect the Specialty Benefits loss ratio to trend back over the next few quarters towards recent trailing 12-month levels with normal quarterly volatility. 
Specialty Benefits continues to deliver above-market growth, with a 7% increase in premium and fees on a normalized trailing 12-month basis. Normalized pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was very strong, at the top end of targeted range. 
As shown on Slide 12, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, a slight increase over the prior year period as growth was partially offset by slightly higher mortality. Normalized trailing 12-month premium and fee growth of 4% is within the targeted range. We continue to execute on our business market strategy, with sales in this market comprising more than half of the total Individual Life sales in the quarter.  
After removing the impact of the 2014 and 2015 third quarter actuarial reviews, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15%, reflecting favorable mortality results.  Corporate pretax operating losses were $55 million, reflecting the timing of some funded initiatives. We expect to be at the low end of our full year range. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $322 million, including net realized capital losses of $15 million. Credit-related losses continued to be lower than our long-term expectations at $6 million. 
One risk the market has been focused on recently is the potential for an interest rate environment that stays low for a long period of time. With only 4% of our $573 billion of assets under management with a minimum guaranteed interest rate, we believe our exposures are manageable, given a business mix that's predominantly fee-based, driving 70% of total company operating earnings; a portfolio of guaranteed businesses that have varying levels of impact from interest rate risk; ongoing derisking activities in the design and distribution of guaranteed products; and disciplined pricing as part of our asset/liability management strategy. 
I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. As outlined on Slide 13, through the second quarter, we've deployed $453 million of capital, with a commitment of approximately $118 million for third quarter common stock dividend. We continue to target $800 million to $1 billion for the full year. Our deployment strategy remains balanced as we look at multiple ways to add long-term value for shareholders. 
In second quarter 2016, we paid a $0.39 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in the third quarter, a 7% increase over third quarter 2015 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we repurchased $104 million worth of common stock in the second quarter. We continue to execute on our board authorized $400 million share repurchase program, and as of today, we have $250 million remaining in that program. We also deployed an additional $38 million in the second quarter as we increased our ownership in existing Principal Global Investor boutiques. 
As I started out saying, we continue to benefit from our diversified and integrated business model and volatile macroeconomic environments. Second quarter was another great example of the strong fundamentals of our business as a result of focused execution and disciplined expense management. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

First thing I'd say on Brexit is we have a very substantial operation in London, so that could be affected longer term depending on how, over the next 2 or 3 years, the Brexit negotiations go. But our main international fund product is domiciled in Dublin, which will remain part of the European Union. So we have our investment adviser and mutual funds domiciled in Dublin. That will allow us access throughout Europe almost regardless of how the negotiations go. We also, in the European Union, just for completeness of offices in Munich, Amsterdam and Malta, all of which give us some flexibility about how we will domicile and manage different businesses depending on how the negotiations go. So we feel pretty well protected here. Our first concern is we have many nationalities in London. It looks as if the ability of our various people in London to continue to be based there will be unimpaired, but that's something we're watching very carefully. That's probably our #1 near-term concern. As regards to clients, Ryan, we have actually seen, if anything, a boost to our business from the tensions within the European Union, if anything, because largely what we're selling is global and dollar-based products, which are extremely attractive in the very low interest rates environment you have in Europe. So Europe has been a pretty good market for us. And even if economies are somewhat negatively impacted by Brexit, both in the Eurozone and in Britain, even if that happens, we would expect to continue to be in a pretty strong position as a fundamentally global and cross-border player."

And particularly, we have been able to see a very important rebound in our activity in Banco do Brasil, particularly Brazilians continue saving money for their long-term saving needs and retirement needs. So it's very clear as well that for a long time, the Brazilian government is going to be unable to put together some kind of a strong pillar 1 for pensions.

And this is a gap that's been part of our business for many, many years. I mean, this isn't a new phenomenon. If you look, quarter-over-quarter sometimes can be a bit -- it can bounce back and forth. But if you look at a trailing 12-month period over the last many years, you're going to generally see that gap, and this is -- remember, this is a growth gap. You're going to generally see that between 4% and 5%. Sometimes, it's going to be more. Sometimes it's going to be less. In a down market, you might see that gap close a bit. But the fact there are many, many factors that are contributing to that, and they're industry factors. There's product mix changes that you get in your block. There's business mix changes that you get in your block. Obviously, there's investment mix changes that are going on in a constant basis, and then there's competitive pricing. So you get -- and I could go and on. There are other factors, but you get the point. There are a number of different factors that are going to impact that delta between the account value growth and the revenue growth. And we're seeing the impact of that, as is everybody in the industry."

The first thing I'd say is there's not an across-the-board mandate to reduce expenses. What we've tried to always do -- Larry did it. Barry did it. Terry has certainly been at the forefront of this as we've migrated the company -- is to really look at the revenues that we're generating and what expenses are necessary in order to get a delta between the 2, and that's where our focus is on. So again, not anything across-the-board, but by business unit, within Jim's operations, Nora's and Deanna's and Luis', as well as across corporate. We're looking at how do we align those expenses for the revenues we're able to create. And it doesn't happen overnight. And I would tell you, we've been at this now for -- it's an ongoing effort, and we're going to continue to focus on that. And at the same time, what I would tell you is we're making the investments where we need to make investments. We have to make an investment in DOL. We have to make an investment in technology. We have to make sure our products are relevant. Part of the diminution of the revenue stream that Nora mentioned was around investment mix. If someone chooses a collective investment trust that has a similar investment strategy, but the underlying revenue associated with it is less, that's good for the customer, good for the participant, good for the adviser, and we need to recognize we have a little bit less revenue coming in. So this won't go away at the end of this quarter or the next quarter. It's something we're just going to continue to keep top of mind, and at same time, never put the mission and the strategy of the organization at risk. Is that helpful?"

Just a couple of comments, and some of this will add on to some of the comments I made in last quarter's results. I think the first thing to keep in mind, as Dan mentioned, we have 1,200 kind of proprietary advisers across the United States. And I think the first thing to remember is they sell across the broad range of products that we offer here in the U.S. And so actually, if you look underneath that, the majority of that systems revenue are actually coming from products that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. That could be, obviously, our life insurance business, disability insurance business, group benefits as well as nonqualified transactions across retirement in PGI. So I think that's the first thing that is great to understand. And then I think underneath that, obviously, the final regs do have a path forward for proprietary products. And even today, our affiliated advisers already have choice between different types of products as well as different proprietary and nonproprietary offerings. And so we think that puts us in a good stead to continue to offer them a competitive set of products and solutions, but also put us in a good stead going forward. I spend a lot of time with these advisers, and I continue to have confidence that they already properly evaluate their customers' needs and make recommendations that are in the best interest of the customer. And I think even though this is going to put some additional compliance and monitoring relative to that, as we leverage the bias for both our retail and retirement plan business, I do feel that both the current business model of those advisers as well as the processes and training we'll be putting in place really do provide a path forward for this part of the business and how it interacts with all of our product solutions."

And we're actually really, really confident in our ability to work with our alliance partners, because we're out there working with them right now. They're going to make decisions about their business model, and we're ready to execute on that. We've already got a couple of things that are in place. We actually have services and products that are in place that already address the DOL rule, levelized commission structure for the broker-dealers. Most of our brokers already use this levelized comp solution that we have. We've already got a 0 revenue share investment platform for both of our fee-based and commission advisers, and that's where we collect administrative fees from participants directly, another solution under the DOL rule. We already have an integrated third-party investment fiduciary service. So that's an example of a product and service that we've had in place for many years, and that's going to directly address the DOL, one of the models that many of our advisers may choose to outsource that third-party investment fiduciary piece. We have a number of in-plan solutions. The new option, obviously, for all of us in the industry, is what we call the BIC, the best interest contract. And as we're out there talking to our distribution partners, we're finding that many of them are going to look and probably execute under the BIC. So we're working with them to help design our end of that equation that then hooks into their end of that equation. The platform exception is one other example. Prepackaged investments, we're having discussions around that. So bottom line is we've got a lot that's already in place, and actually, we've been executing on it for a number of years, and we're out there with our alliance partners. Many, many of them may be leaning to the BIC, and we'll be ready to go on that front."

In the mutual fund business, the adverse impact for the business, generally, will be around moves towards lower-cost share classes. And for us, a move to lower-cost share classes basically means share classes without a 12b-1 fee or a front-end load. But that move has been going on anyway for several years. For example, 70% of our A shares in our mutual fund business are already load waived. So it's a pretty small minority of our mutual funds where we have a front-end load. That will eventually go away, perhaps accelerated by the implications of the DOL rule. But it's a pretty small amount for us, and currently, we're collecting around $5 million annually from the entire front-end loads. So that is a pretty modest impact and it will go away gradually. On the 12b-1s, those are basically a pass-through for our business. They're a way that advisers get paid and that is passed through by the fund company. So the effect on -- of 12b-1s going away should in the end be negligible over the period it happens. So we don't see that as having a big implication. It's all part of the general fee erosion which is happening in mutual funds, which just means we have to get more efficient. I think also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of opportunities. One is if you look around at retirement platforms in the industry generally, there may be a move away from poorer-performing or less-well-designed proprietary products. That will be an opportunity for us to offer our products on a Defined Contribution, Investment Only basis, and we are increasing our resources devoted to finding those clients. And secondly, on the efficiency point, I'd remind you we did a business integration announced early last year of our funds company with Principal Global Investors. That is enabling us to grow the business without adding costs. It wasn't done as a cost take-out. We haven't had any reduction in force consequent on that integration. But it's an opportunity for us to gradually redeploy people, become more efficient and actually do more business with our existing team."

Most of our businesses, like we talked about in the past, are fee-based businesses, which generates a lot more of that capital -- earnings that are available. As you look at that $800 million to $1 billion, we've already made a pretty good dent in it already in terms of capital that we've deployed in the first half of the year as well as we committed to. We announced our increase in the third quarter dividend up to $0.41. We're pleased with that. We're progressing towards that 40% payout ratio. We're continuing to move towards that. We -- acquisitions, we put more into the boutique strategy, which is part of our long-term strategy, buying part of additional shares of Finisterre, Origin, CCI as well as Claritas. That's a good, consistent process that we've been having in place for a long time. The share buyback program, you're aware that we had a $400 million authorization in February. We're executing on that. As I stated in the comments that we've executed -- we still have $250 million of authorization going forward. And so far, what we've deployed and committed is over $600 million, in so far. Now we have options for the rest of the year, where hopefully, we'll pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter, which we assume will happen. In M&A activity, we're always looking for options and opportunities there. Share buybacks, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, $250 million of that authorization. With the low interest rate environment right now, Suneet, there's some opportunities. There's some opportunities to actually execute on some of our debt maturities that we have coming up. We have in 2017, we have $300 million, and that's at a 1.8% coupon. 2019, we have a $350 million, which is at a high 8 7/8% coupon.

So we have options. Now are we going to exceed that $1 billion? No, I can't say at this point in time, because, as I mentioned, share buybacks and some of those other opportunities will continue to unfold as the year goes on. But if you look back to last year, if you look back to 2015, we said that $800 million to $1 billion, and we were a little bit over that at $1,070,000,000, which was about 90% of our net income. So we're continuing to deploy capital in what we believe is a balanced approach to enhance the long-term shareholder value. So stay tuned."

I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. 
I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, particularly so given the context of 4 macroeconomic headwinds impacting our businesses: volatile equity markets, volatile emerging markets and foreign exchange rates, low interest rates and growing demand for lower-cost investment options. 
Despite these pressures, over the trailing 12 months, we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in operating earnings, $17 billion of net cash flows and a $33 billion increase in assets under management. 
As shown on Slide 5, strong investment performance remains a key contributor, with 90-plus percent of our Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust above median for 3- and 5-year performance at the end of the second quarter. These results reflect several other strengths as well. 
I'll briefly share some thoughts on each of them, starting with our success managing the right active strategies. While many other active managers are struggling, Principal Global Investors delivered $6.4 billion in positive net cash flows through the first half of 2016. The success reflects our focus on asset allocation, multi-asset, multi-manager strategies and our outcomes-based solutions. 
While volatile conditions remain, our strong net cash flows reflect strong underlying growth. We benefit, again, from a diversified business model, but more importantly, from how our businesses are integrated. 
Retirement and Income Solutions is central to that integration and our ability to meet customer needs throughout the spectrum of accumulation and retirement income stages. When Full Service Accumulation grows, it drives enterprise growth, increasing the pool of retirement assets for Principal Global Investors to manage as well as growth for our retail funds and annuity businesses and, of course, Principal Bank. 
The U.S. retirement industry is a competitive market. That said, we remain highly competitive, and the fundamentals remains strong. We added 1,100 net new defined contribution plans over the trailing 12 months and nearly 100,000 new participants with account values. 
I'd also point to our exceptional joint venture partners. Despite the severe recession in Brazil, we have nearly $4 billion of positive net cash flows through mid-year, much can be attributed to the relationship with our partner, Banco do Brasil. 
Another example is our joint venture with China Construction Bank. Over the trailing 12 months, our pretax operating earnings in China have nearly tripled to $34 million. While the vast majority of China's assets under management growth and net cash flows this quarter were institutional and short term in nature, we're building momentum with retail investors. 
A couple additional points on our opportunity in China. First, an update on last quarter's announcement about the memorandum of understanding we signed with China Construction Bank to develop a new pension joint venture. Again, this is a longer-term initiative, but we're already dedicating resources. We're also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to share Principal's pension and asset management expertise with China Construction Bank and build relationships with leadership at their pension company. 
Lastly, as the result of our long-term commitment to China and strong relationship, I had the privilege of participating in the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing in June. This gave me an opportunity to further discuss our commitment to improving retirement readiness in China and, to that end, the importance of Principal obtaining a pension license. 
The last area I will cover is our continued strong track record of execution. Specialty Benefits is a great example. The level and consistency of growth and profitability in this business continues to be industry-leading, reflecting our focus on small- to medium-sized businesses, strong pricing discipline and strong claims management. 
Strong execution also applies to 3 other areas I've been highlighting with investors: our solution set, distribution and customer experience. Here are a few examples that reflect our ongoing effort to evolve the organization in these areas and position Principal for sustainable, profitable growth. 
I'll start with PlanWorks, our retirement readiness plan design. Through the first 6 months of 2016, we've increased the number of PlanWorks contracts by 25% compared to the same period a year ago and more than double the number of additional participants covered. While this is resource-intensive and is accomplished one plan at a time, this work is moving the needle in 2 important ways: First, higher participation rates and use of automatic deferral increases is contributing to growth in reoccurring deposits, which are up approximately $500 million through the first 6 months of 2016. Second, better participant outcomes contribute to continued strong contract-level retention, which is more than 97% through mid-year 2016. 
From a distribution standpoint, we continue to make meaningful progress getting our funds on third-party platforms, model portfolios and recommended lists. Through mid-year 2016, we put more than 20 different funds on nearly 20 different platforms, with success across equities, fixed income as well as alternatives. 
Moving to our solution set. In addition to multiple fund launches in the first half of the year, we positioned multiple offerings for the second half launch. Our global product strategy contemplates opportunities, such as accelerating demand for income solutions due to the aging global populations, potential disruption from regulatory changes as well as the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
As one final example, I'll highlight our recent launch of online individual life and individual disability insurance purchasing portal. We're already seeing strong interest in the site. It is producing leads and conversion to sales of nearly 10%. This demonstrates the need individuals have for these products and their desire to engage with us to further protect their financial future. 
Before I hand off to Terry, I want to provide a brief update on work we're doing to prepare for the implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. We're making significant progress working with multiple distribution partners to design an array of best-interest solutions and address changing business models. 
As we said last quarter, we believe we'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Since the release of the final rule, our cross-business unit teams have gained a clearer understanding of the cost to cover training and system and product modifications to ensure we can continue to serve advisers and customers post-implementation. We anticipate the increased cost will be approximately $1 million per month over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully implemented, we estimate the annual operational costs associated with the new rule to increase annual expenses by $5 million to $10 million. 
In closing, again, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to position Principal for long-term growth through strong execution and ongoing investments to enhance our competitive position. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Our teams delivered strong results in the second quarter, proving once again that our diversified and integrated business model drives results despite some ongoing macroeconomic volatility. 
Second quarter total company after-tax operating earnings were $337 million, the second highest on record. This was a 3% increase compared to the normalized year ago quarter and an 18% increase over first quarter 2016. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to manage the long-term growth rate of expenses in line with revenues, and we'll continue to see a positive impact from that in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to second quarter 2015, the S&P daily average was more than 1% lower in second quarter 2016, resulting in lower fee income and impacting earnings on our fee-based businesses. However, compared to the first quarter, the daily average was up 6%. 
Additionally, persistent low interest rates pressure our spread and risk-based businesses. Although the majority of our earnings come from our fee-based businesses, we are impacted by the low-interest rate environment, and as I'll discuss later in the call, we'll continue to work to mitigate that risk. 
As shown on Slide 6, reported earnings per share were $1.15 for second quarter 2016, a 5% increase over the normalized year ago quarter. We did not normalize any items in the second quarter as performance fees, claims and encaje performance were all within normal volatility. I'll cover those items in more detail in the business unit sections. 
At the end of the second quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.3%. This was down 140 basis points from the year ago quarter, reflecting flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and lower prepayment activity. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 7 with the RIS-Fee businesses. Second quarter pretax operating earnings were $125 million, down 13% from the year ago quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower fee revenue and lower variable investment income, partially offset by diligent expense management. 
However, we've seen a strong 9% increase from the first quarter, reflecting growth in the business, improved market performance and continued expense management. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 29%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 32% in second quarter 2016. Despite the ongoing competitiveness of the U.S. retirement market, we remain confident of our opportunities in this business. 
RIS-Fee quarterly net cash flows were flat, reflecting the loss of one large client. The pipeline remains strong, and we expect net cash flows to be at the upper end of our stated range of 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account values. 
Turning to Slide 8. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $70 million, a 2% increase over the normalized prior year quarter. Growth in the business was partially offset by a decline in variable investment income. On a sequential basis, growth in the business and higher variable investment income generated a 4% increase on pretax operating earnings. 
While Full Service Payout sales were lower in the second quarter compared to record sales in the prior year quarter, we still have a strong pipeline in our target market. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, second quarter pretax return on net revenue, after adjusting for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, was 55%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $118 million, a 19% increase over the year ago quarter and a 47% increase over the first quarter. Performance and transaction fees rebounded from the lower levels in the first quarter. Second quarter's fees are slightly above our long-term quarterly expectations. However, on a year-to-date basis, these fees are in line with our expectations and are a good proxy going forward. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to record assets under management, record operating earnings and positive net cash flows of nearly $6 billion, a contrast from recent trends in the active management space. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 34% in the second quarter, and within our targeted range. 
Slide 10 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International were at $70 million. Second quarter 2016 encaje performance was $5 million lower than expected on a pretax basis, within expected volatility. Compared to the first quarter, operating earnings were up 3% due to the underlying growth of the business. Foreign currency tailwinds during the quarter were partially offset by headwinds from Latin American inflation. 
On a constant currency basis and adjusting for expected encaje performance, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in operating earnings and revenues. Net cash flows for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong net cash flows within our 2 companies in Brazil: Brasilprev and Claritas. Brasilprev captured 59% of the open pension industry net deposits during the second quarter. And Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, generated $200 million of net cash flows in the quarter, demonstrating its strategic importance in this market. 
Although not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows of $3.2 billion for the quarter, our joint venture in China generated a record $45 billion of net cash flows in the second quarter, but nearly all of the flows were short term in nature and with low basis point fees. These institutional mandates carry no investment guarantees. 
Turning to U.S. Insurance Solutions. It was a strong quarter, with pretax operating earnings of $104 million, up 18% over the prior year quarter. We also had nice top line growth, with overall sales up 12% and premium and fees up 7%. 
On Slide 11, Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were a strong $67 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a favorable loss ratio. The loss ratio was driven by positive claims volatility within our expected range, continued investments in our claims process and technology and strong underwriting and renewal practices. We expect the Specialty Benefits loss ratio to trend back over the next few quarters towards recent trailing 12-month levels with normal quarterly volatility. 
Specialty Benefits continues to deliver above-market growth, with a 7% increase in premium and fees on a normalized trailing 12-month basis. Normalized pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was very strong, at the top end of targeted range. 
As shown on Slide 12, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, a slight increase over the prior year period as growth was partially offset by slightly higher mortality. Normalized trailing 12-month premium and fee growth of 4% is within the targeted range. We continue to execute on our business market strategy, with sales in this market comprising more than half of the total Individual Life sales in the quarter. 
After removing the impact of the 2014 and 2015 third quarter actuarial reviews, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15%, reflecting favorable mortality results. Corporate pretax operating losses were $55 million, reflecting the timing of some funded initiatives. We expect to be at the low end of our full year range. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $322 million, including net realized capital losses of $15 million. Credit-related losses continued to be lower than our long-term expectations at $6 million. 
One risk the market has been focused on recently is the potential for an interest rate environment that stays low for a long period of time. With only 4% of our $573 billion of assets under management with a minimum guaranteed interest rate, we believe our exposures are manageable, given a business mix that's predominantly fee-based, driving 70% of total company operating earnings; a portfolio of guaranteed businesses that have varying levels of impact from interest rate risk; ongoing derisking activities in the design and distribution of guaranteed products; and disciplined pricing as part of our asset/liability management strategy. 
I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. As outlined on Slide 13, through the second quarter, we've deployed $453 million of capital, with a commitment of approximately $118 million for third quarter common stock dividend. We continue to target $800 million to $1 billion for the full year. Our deployment strategy remains balanced as we look at multiple ways to add long-term value for shareholders. 
In second quarter 2016, we paid a $0.39 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in the third quarter, a 7% increase over third quarter 2015 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we repurchased $104 million worth of common stock in the second quarter. We continue to execute on our board authorized $400 million share repurchase program, and as of today, we have $250 million remaining in that program. We also deployed an additional $38 million in the second quarter as we increased our ownership in existing Principal Global Investor boutiques. 
As I started out saying, we continue to benefit from our diversified and integrated business model and volatile macroeconomic environments. Second quarter was another great example of the strong fundamentals of our business as a result of focused execution and disciplined expense management. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

But our main international fund product is domiciled in Dublin, which will remain part of the European Union. So we have our investment adviser and mutual funds domiciled in Dublin. That will allow us access throughout Europe almost regardless of how the negotiations go. We also, in the European Union, just for completeness of offices in Munich, Amsterdam and Malta, all of which give us some flexibility about how we will domicile and manage different businesses depending on how the negotiations go. So we feel pretty well protected here. Our first concern is we have many nationalities in London. It looks as if the ability of our various people in London to continue to be based there will be unimpaired, but that's something we're watching very carefully. That's probably our #1 near-term concern. As regards to clients, Ryan, we have actually seen, if anything, a boost to our business from the tensions within the European Union, if anything, because largely what we're selling is global and dollar-based products, which are extremely attractive in the very low interest rates environment you have in Europe. So Europe has been a pretty good market for us. And even if economies are somewhat negatively impacted by Brexit, both in the Eurozone and in Britain, even if that happens, we would expect to continue to be in a pretty strong position as a fundamentally global and cross-border player."

And particularly, we have been able to see a very important rebound in our activity in Banco do Brasil, particularly Brazilians continue saving money for their long-term saving needs and retirement needs.

You've identified the fact that we quarter-over-quarter have variable investment income down. But what you're asking about is really the gap between account value growth and revenue growth. And this is a gap that's been part of our business for many, many years. I mean, this isn't a new phenomenon. If you look, quarter-over-quarter sometimes can be a bit -- it can bounce back and forth. But if you look at a trailing 12-month period over the last many years, you're going to generally see that gap, and this is -- remember, this is a growth gap. You're going to generally see that between 4% and 5%. Sometimes, it's going to be more. Sometimes it's going to be less. In a down market, you might see that gap close a bit. But the fact there are many, many factors that are contributing to that, and they're industry factors. There's product mix changes that you get in your block. There's business mix changes that you get in your block. Obviously, there's investment mix changes that are going on in a constant basis, and then there's competitive pricing. So you get -- and I could go and on. There are other factors, but you get the point. There are a number of different factors that are going to impact that delta between the account value growth and the revenue growth.

The first thing I'd say is there's not an across-the-board mandate to reduce expenses. What we've tried to always do -- Larry did it. Barry did it.

So again, not anything across-the-board, but by business unit, within Jim's operations, Nora's and Deanna's and Luis', as well as across corporate. We're looking at how do we align those expenses for the revenues we're able to create. And it doesn't happen overnight. And I would tell you, we've been at this now for -- it's an ongoing effort, and we're going to continue to focus on that. And at the same time, what I would tell you is we're making the investments where we need to make investments. We have to make an investment in DOL. We have to make an investment in technology. We have to make sure our products are relevant. Part of the diminution of the revenue stream that Nora mentioned was around investment mix. If someone chooses a collective investment trust that has a similar investment strategy, but the underlying revenue associated with it is less, that's good for the customer, good for the participant, good for the adviser, and we need to recognize we have a little bit less revenue coming in. So this won't go away at the end of this quarter or the next quarter. It's something we're just going to continue to keep top of mind, and at same time, never put the mission and the strategy of the organization at risk. Is that helpful?"

Just a couple of comments, and some of this will add on to some of the comments I made in last quarter's results. I think the first thing to keep in mind, as Dan mentioned, we have 1,200 kind of proprietary advisers across the United States. And I think the first thing to remember is they sell across the broad range of products that we offer here in the U.S. And so actually, if you look underneath that, the majority of that systems revenue are actually coming from products that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. That could be, obviously, our life insurance business, disability insurance business, group benefits as well as nonqualified transactions across retirement in PGI. So I think that's the first thing that is great to understand. And then I think underneath that, obviously, the final regs do have a path forward for proprietary products. And even today, our affiliated advisers already have choice between different types of products as well as different proprietary and nonproprietary offerings. And so we think that puts us in a good stead to continue to offer them a competitive set of products and solutions, but also put us in a good stead going forward. I spend a lot of time with these advisers, and I continue to have confidence that they already properly evaluate their customers' needs and make recommendations that are in the best interest of the customer. And I think even though this is going to put some additional compliance and monitoring relative to that, as we leverage the bias for both our retail and retirement plan business, I do feel that both the current business model of those advisers as well as the processes and training we'll be putting in place really do provide a path forward for this part of the business and how it interacts with all of our product solutions."

And we're actually really, really confident in our ability to work with our alliance partners, because we're out there working with them right now. They're going to make decisions about their business model, and we're ready to execute on that. We've already got a couple of things that are in place. We actually have services and products that are in place that already address the DOL rule, levelized commission structure for the broker-dealers. Most of our brokers already use this levelized comp solution that we have. We've already got a 0 revenue share investment platform for both of our fee-based and commission advisers, and that's where we collect administrative fees from participants directly, another solution under the DOL rule. We already have an integrated third-party investment fiduciary service. So that's an example of a product and service that we've had in place for many years, and that's going to directly address the DOL, one of the models that many of our advisers may choose to outsource that third-party investment fiduciary piece. We have a number of in-plan solutions. The new option, obviously, for all of us in the industry, is what we call the BIC, the best interest contract. And as we're out there talking to our distribution partners, we're finding that many of them are going to look and probably execute under the BIC. So we're working with them to help design our end of that equation that then hooks into their end of that equation. The platform exception is one other example. Prepackaged investments, we're having discussions around that. So bottom line is we've got a lot that's already in place, and actually, we've been executing on it for a number of years, and we're out there with our alliance partners. Many, many of them may be leaning to the BIC, and we'll be ready to go on that front."

In the mutual fund business, the adverse impact for the business, generally, will be around moves towards lower-cost share classes. And for us, a move to lower-cost share classes basically means share classes without a 12b-1 fee or a front-end load. But that move has been going on anyway for several years. For example, 70% of our A shares in our mutual fund business are already load waived. So it's a pretty small minority of our mutual funds where we have a front-end load. That will eventually go away, perhaps accelerated by the implications of the DOL rule. But it's a pretty small amount for us, and currently, we're collecting around $5 million annually from the entire front-end loads. So that is a pretty modest impact and it will go away gradually. On the 12b-1s, those are basically a pass-through for our business. They're a way that advisers get paid and that is passed through by the fund company. So the effect on -- of 12b-1s going away should in the end be negligible over the period it happens. So we don't see that as having a big implication. It's all part of the general fee erosion which is happening in mutual funds, which just means we have to get more efficient. I think also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of opportunities. One is if you look around at retirement platforms in the industry generally, there may be a move away from poorer-performing or less-well-designed proprietary products. That will be an opportunity for us to offer our products on a Defined Contribution, Investment Only basis, and we are increasing our resources devoted to finding those clients. And secondly, on the efficiency point, I'd remind you we did a business integration announced early last year of our funds company with Principal Global Investors. That is enabling us to grow the business without adding costs. It wasn't done as a cost take-out. We haven't had any reduction in force consequent on that integration. But it's an opportunity for us to gradually redeploy people, become more efficient and actually do more business with our existing team."

So the Chinese government has been very eager and keener to try to, I would say, reduce the activity related with the wealth management products; also trying to manage, in some way, all the shadow banking and also other type of activities and lending activities that you might have there. We are not reporting and we never have reported any kind of wealth management product activity. And in our JV, we don't have -- almost nothing and a very small part of our asset management in the JV that we're not reporting that money is that's kind of wealth management product. But we have a very marginal activity in that part of the business in China in our JV."

We'd look at this as a balanced approach of capital deployment to our long-term shareholder strategy and value. Most of our businesses, like we talked about in the past, are fee-based businesses, which generates a lot more of that capital -- earnings that are available. As you look at that $800 million to $1 billion, we've already made a pretty good dent in it already in terms of capital that we've deployed in the first half of the year as well as we committed to. We announced our increase in the third quarter dividend up to $0.41. We're pleased with that. We're progressing towards that 40% payout ratio. We're continuing to move towards that. We -- acquisitions, we put more into the boutique strategy, which is part of our long-term strategy, buying part of additional shares of Finisterre, Origin, CCI as well as Claritas. That's a good, consistent process that we've been having in place for a long time. The share buyback program, you're aware that we had a $400 million authorization in February. We're executing on that. As I stated in the comments that we've executed -- we still have $250 million of authorization going forward. And so far, what we've deployed and committed is over $600 million, in so far. Now we have options for the rest of the year, where hopefully, we'll pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter, which we assume will happen. In M&A activity, we're always looking for options and opportunities there. Share buybacks, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, $250 million of that authorization. With the low interest rate environment right now, Suneet, there's some opportunities. There's some opportunities to actually execute on some of our debt maturities that we have coming up. We have in 2017, we have $300 million, and that's at a 1.8% coupon. 2019, we have a $350 million, which is at a high 8 7/8% coupon. So we have an opportunity to actually execute on that, enhance the overall return of the organization and reduce our leverage ratio. As right now, we're under 24%. We're marching towards 20%. So we have options. Now are we going to exceed that $1 billion? No, I can't say at this point in time, because, as I mentioned, share buybacks and some of those other opportunities will continue to unfold as the year goes on. But if you look back to last year, if you look back to 2015, we said that $800 million to $1 billion, and we were a little bit over that at $1,070,000,000, which was about 90% of our net income. So we're continuing to deploy capital in what we believe is a balanced approach to enhance the long-term shareholder value. So stay tuned."

I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, part",1152,"Thank you, John. I want to start by expressing my continued confidence in our strategy and our diversified integrated set of businesses that work well together through the lens of the client. 
I'd characterize our results through 6 months as strong, particularly so given the context of 4 macroeconomic headwinds impacting our businesses: volatile equity markets, volatile emerging markets and foreign exchange rates, low interest rates and growing demand for lower-cost investment options. 
Despite these pressures, over the trailing 12 months, we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in operating earnings, $17 billion of net cash flows and a $33 billion increase in assets under management. 
As shown on Slide 5, strong investment performance remains a key contributor, with 90-plus percent of our Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust above median for 3- and 5-year performance at the end of the second quarter. These results reflect several other strengths as well. 
I'll briefly share some thoughts on each of them, starting with our success managing the right active strategies. While many other active managers are struggling, Principal Global Investors delivered $6.4 billion in positive net cash flows through the first half of 2016. The success reflects our focus on asset allocation, multi-asset, multi-manager strategies and our outcomes-based solutions. 
While volatile conditions remain, our strong net cash flows reflect strong underlying growth. We benefit, again, from a diversified business model, but more importantly, from how our businesses are integrated. 
Retirement and Income Solutions is central to that integration and our ability to meet customer needs throughout the spectrum of accumulation and retirement income stages. When Full Service Accumulation grows, it drives enterprise growth, increasing the pool of retirement assets for Principal Global Investors to manage as well as growth for our retail funds and annuity businesses and, of course, Principal Bank. 
The U.S. retirement industry is a competitive market. That said, we remain highly competitive, and the fundamentals remains strong. We added 1,100 net new defined contribution plans over the trailing 12 months and nearly 100,000 new participants with account values. 
I'd also point to our exceptional joint venture partners. Despite the severe recession in Brazil, we have nearly $4 billion of positive net cash flows through mid-year, much can be attributed to the relationship with our partner, Banco do Brasil. 
Another example is our joint venture with China Construction Bank. Over the trailing 12 months, our pretax operating earnings in China have nearly tripled to $34 million. While the vast majority of China's assets under management growth and net cash flows this quarter were institutional and short term in nature, we're building momentum with retail investors. 
A couple additional points on our opportunity in China. First, an update on last quarter's announcement about the memorandum of understanding we signed with China Construction Bank to develop a new pension joint venture. Again, this is a longer-term initiative, but we're already dedicating resources. We're also doing a lot of work behind the scenes to share Principal's pension and asset management expertise with China Construction Bank and build relationships with leadership at their pension company. 
Lastly, as the result of our long-term commitment to China and strong relationship, I had the privilege of participating in the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing in June. This gave me an opportunity to further discuss our commitment to improving retirement readiness in China and, to that end, the importance of Principal obtaining a pension license. 
The last area I will cover is our continued strong track record of execution. Specialty Benefits is a great example. The level and consistency of growth and profitability in this business continues to be industry-leading, reflecting our focus on small- to medium-sized businesses, strong pricing discipline and strong claims management. 
Strong execution also applies to 3 other areas I've been highlighting with investors: our solution set, distribution and customer experience. Here are a few examples that reflect our ongoing effort to evolve the organization in these areas and position Principal for sustainable, profitable growth. 
I'll start with PlanWorks, our retirement readiness plan design. Through the first 6 months of 2016, we've increased the number of PlanWorks contracts by 25% compared to the same period a year ago and more than double the number of additional participants covered. While this is resource-intensive and is accomplished one plan at a time, this work is moving the needle in 2 important ways: First, higher participation rates and use of automatic deferral increases is contributing to growth in reoccurring deposits, which are up approximately $500 million through the first 6 months of 2016. Second, better participant outcomes contribute to continued strong contract-level retention, which is more than 97% through mid-year 2016. 
From a distribution standpoint, we continue to make meaningful progress getting our funds on third-party platforms, model portfolios and recommended lists. Through mid-year 2016, we put more than 20 different funds on nearly 20 different platforms, with success across equities, fixed income as well as alternatives. 
Moving to our solution set. In addition to multiple fund launches in the first half of the year, we positioned multiple offerings for the second half launch. Our global product strategy contemplates opportunities, such as accelerating demand for income solutions due to the aging global populations, potential disruption from regulatory changes as well as the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
As one final example, I'll highlight our recent launch of online individual life and individual disability insurance purchasing portal. We're already seeing strong interest in the site. It is producing leads and conversion to sales of nearly 10%. This demonstrates the need individuals have for these products and their desire to engage with us to further protect their financial future. 
Before I hand off to Terry, I want to provide a brief update on work we're doing to prepare for the implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. We're making significant progress working with multiple distribution partners to design an array of best-interest solutions and address changing business models. 
As we said last quarter, we believe we'll continue to lead the industry by creating sustainable solutions that meet the needs of the market, by managing assets appropriate for retirement and other long-term strategies and providing a diversified portfolio of in-plan offerings and systematic withdrawal solutions. 
Since the release of the final rule, our cross-business unit teams have gained a clearer understanding of the cost to cover training and system and product modifications to ensure we can continue to serve advisers and customers post-implementation. We anticipate the increased cost will be approximately $1 million per month over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully implemented, we estimate the annual operational costs associated with the new rule to increase annual expenses by $5 million to $10 million. 
In closing, again, the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we continue to position Principal for long-term growth through strong execution and ongoing investments to enhance our competitive position. Terry?"

This morning, I'll focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Our teams delivered strong results in the second quarter, proving once again that our diversified and integrated business model drives results despite some ongoing macroeconomic volatility. 
Second quarter total company after-tax operating earnings were $337 million, the second highest on record. This was a 3% increase compared to the normalized year ago quarter and an 18% increase over first quarter 2016. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to manage the long-term growth rate of expenses in line with revenues, and we'll continue to see a positive impact from that in the second half of 2016. 
Compared to second quarter 2015, the S&P daily average was more than 1% lower in second quarter 2016, resulting in lower fee income and impacting earnings on our fee-based businesses. However, compared to the first quarter, the daily average was up 6%. 
Additionally, persistent low interest rates pressure our spread and risk-based businesses. Although the majority of our earnings come from our fee-based businesses, we are impacted by the low-interest rate environment, and as I'll discuss later in the call, we'll continue to work to mitigate that risk. 
As shown on Slide 6, reported earnings per share were $1.15 for second quarter 2016, a 5% increase over the normalized year ago quarter. We did not normalize any items in the second quarter as performance fees, claims and encaje performance were all within normal volatility. I'll cover those items in more detail in the business unit sections. 
At the end of the second quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.3%. This was down 140 basis points from the year ago quarter, reflecting flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and lower prepayment activity. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 7 with the RIS-Fee businesses. Second quarter pretax operating earnings were $125 million, down 13% from the year ago quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower fee revenue and lower variable investment income, partially offset by diligent expense management. 
However, we've seen a strong 9% increase from the first quarter, reflecting growth in the business, improved market performance and continued expense management. 
On a reported basis, trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 29%. After normalizing for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 32% in second quarter 2016. Despite the ongoing competitiveness of the U.S. retirement market, we remain confident of our opportunities in this business. 
RIS-Fee quarterly net cash flows were flat, reflecting the loss of one large client. The pipeline remains strong, and we expect net cash flows to be at the upper end of our stated range of 1% to 3% of beginning-of-year account values. 
Turning to Slide 8. RIS-Spread quarterly pretax operating earnings were $70 million, a 2% increase over the normalized prior year quarter. Growth in the business was partially offset by a decline in variable investment income. On a sequential basis, growth in the business and higher variable investment income generated a 4% increase on pretax operating earnings. 
While Full Service Payout sales were lower in the second quarter compared to record sales in the prior year quarter, we still have a strong pipeline in our target market. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, second quarter pretax return on net revenue, after adjusting for the third quarter 2015 actuarial assumption review, was 55%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $118 million, a 19% increase over the year ago quarter and a 47% increase over the first quarter. Performance and transaction fees rebounded from the lower levels in the first quarter. Second quarter's fees are slightly above our long-term quarterly expectations. However, on a year-to-date basis, these fees are in line with our expectations and are a good proxy going forward. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to record assets under management, record operating earnings and positive net cash flows of nearly $6 billion, a contrast from recent trends in the active management space. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, the pretax return on adjusted revenue was 34% in the second quarter, and within our targeted range. 
Slide 10 shows quarterly pretax operating earnings for Principal International were at $70 million. Second quarter 2016 encaje performance was $5 million lower than expected on a pretax basis, within expected volatility. Compared to the first quarter, operating earnings were up 3% due to the underlying growth of the business. Foreign currency tailwinds during the quarter were partially offset by headwinds from Latin American inflation. 
On a constant currency basis and adjusting for expected encaje performance, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in operating earnings and revenues. Net cash flows for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong net cash flows within our 2 companies in Brazil: Brasilprev and Claritas. Brasilprev captured 59% of the open pension industry net deposits during the second quarter. And Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, generated $200 million of net cash flows in the quarter, demonstrating its strategic importance in this market. 
Although not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows of $3.2 billion for the quarter, our joint venture in China generated a record $45 billion of net cash flows in the second quarter, but nearly all of the flows were short term in nature and with low basis point fees. These institutional mandates carry no investment guarantees. 
Turning to U.S. Insurance Solutions. It was a strong quarter, with pretax operating earnings of $104 million, up 18% over the prior year quarter. We also had nice top line growth, with overall sales up 12% and premium and fees up 7%. 
On Slide 11, Specialty Benefits quarterly pretax operating earnings were a strong $67 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a favorable loss ratio. The loss ratio was driven by positive claims volatility within our expected range, continued investments in our claims process and technology and strong underwriting and renewal practices. We expect the Specialty Benefits loss ratio to trend back over the next few quarters towards recent trailing 12-month levels with normal quarterly volatility. 
Specialty Benefits continues to deliver above-market growth, with a 7% increase in premium and fees on a normalized trailing 12-month basis. Normalized pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was very strong, at the top end of targeted range. 
As shown on Slide 12, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $37 million for the quarter, a slight increase over the prior year period as growth was partially offset by slightly higher mortality. Normalized trailing 12-month premium and fee growth of 4% is within the targeted range. We continue to execute on our business market strategy, with sales in this market comprising more than half of the total Individual Life sales in the quarter. 
After removing the impact of the 2014 and 2015 third quarter actuarial reviews, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15%, reflecting favorable mortality results. Corporate pretax operating losses were $55 million, reflecting the timing of some funded initiatives. We expect to be at the low end of our full year range. 
For the quarter, total company net income was $322 million, including net realized capital losses of $15 million. Credit-related losses continued to be lower than our long-term expectations at $6 million. 
One risk the market has been focused on recently is the potential for an interest rate environment that stays low for a long period of time. With only 4% of our $573 billion of assets under management with a minimum guaranteed interest rate, we believe our exposures are manageable, given a business mix that's predominantly fee-based, driving 70% of total company operating earnings; a portfolio of guaranteed businesses that have varying levels of impact from interest rate risk; ongoing derisking activities in the design and distribution of guaranteed products; and disciplined pricing as part of our asset/liability management strategy. 
I'll close with some comments on our capital management strategy. As outlined on Slide 13, through the second quarter, we've deployed $453 million of capital, with a commitment of approximately $118 million for third quarter common stock dividend. We continue to target $800 million to $1 billion for the full year. Our deployment strategy remains balanced as we look at multiple ways to add long-term value for shareholders. 
In second quarter 2016, we paid a $0.39 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced an increase in our common stock dividend to $0.41 per share, payable in the third quarter, a 7% increase over third quarter 2015 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we repurchased $104 million worth of common stock in the second quarter. We continue to execute on our board authorized $400 million share repurchase program, and as of today, we have $250 million remaining in that program. We also deployed an additional $38 million in the second quarter as we increased our ownership in existing Principal Global Investor boutiques. 
As I started out saying, we continue to benefit from our diversified and integrated business model and volatile macroeconomic environments. Second quarter was another great example of the strong fundamentals of our business as a result of focused execution and disciplined expense management. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

First thing I'd say on Brexit is we have a very substantial operation in London, so that could be affected longer term depending on how, over the next 2 or 3 years, the Brexit negotiations go. But our main international fund product is domiciled in Dublin, which will remain part of the European Union. So we have our investment adviser and mutual funds domiciled in Dublin. That will allow us access throughout Europe almost regardless of how the negotiations go. We also, in the European Union, just for completeness of offices in Munich, Amsterdam and Malta, all of which give us some flexibility about how we will domicile and manage different businesses depending on how the negotiations go. So we feel pretty well protected here. Our first concern is we have many nationalities in London. It looks as if the ability of our various people in London to continue to be based there will be unimpaired, but that's something we're watching very carefully. That's probably our #1 near-term concern. As regards to clients, Ryan, we have actually seen, if anything, a boost to our business from the tensions within the European Union, if anything, because largely what we're selling is global and dollar-based products, which are extremely attractive in the very low interest rates environment you have in Europe. So Europe has been a pretty good market for us. And even if economies are somewhat negatively impacted by Brexit, both in the Eurozone and in Britain, even if that happens, we would expect to continue to be in a pretty strong position as a fundamentally global and cross-border player."

And particularly, we have been able to see a very important rebound in our activity in Banco do Brasil, particularly Brazilians continue saving money for their long-term saving needs and retirement needs. So it's very clear as well that for a long time, the Brazilian government is going to be unable to put together some kind of a strong pillar 1 for pensions.

You've identified the fact that we quarter-over-quarter have variable investment income down. But what you're asking about is really the gap between account value growth and revenue growth. And this is a gap that's been part of our business for many, many years. I mean, this isn't a new phenomenon. If you look, quarter-over-quarter sometimes can be a bit -- it can bounce back and forth. But if you look at a trailing 12-month period over the last many years, you're going to generally see that gap, and this is -- remember, this is a growth gap. You're going to generally see that between 4% and 5%. Sometimes, it's going to be more. Sometimes it's going to be less. In a down market, you might see that gap close a bit. But the fact there are many, many factors that are contributing to that, and they're industry factors. There's product mix changes that you get in your block. There's business mix changes that you get in your block. Obviously, there's investment mix changes that are going on in a constant basis, and then there's competitive pricing. So you get -- and I could go and on. There are other factors, but you get the point. There are a number of different factors that are going to impact that delta between the account value growth and the revenue growth. And we're seeing the impact of that, as is everybody in the industry."

The first thing I'd say is there's not an across-the-board mandate to reduce expenses. What we've tried to always do -- Larry did it. Barry did it.

So again, not anything across-the-board, but by business unit, within Jim's operations, Nora's and Deanna's and Luis' as well as across corporate. We're looking at how do we align those expenses for the revenues we're able to create. And it doesn't happen overnight. And I would tell you, we've been at this now for -- it's an ongoing effort, and we're going to continue to focus on that. And at the same time, what I would tell you is we're making the investments where we need to make investments. We have to make an investment in DOL. We have to make an investment in technology. We have to make sure our products are relevant. Part of the diminution of the revenue stream that Nora mentioned was around investment mix. If someone chooses a collective investment trust that has a similar investment strategy, but the underlying revenue associated with it is less, that's good for the customer, good for the participant, good for the adviser, and we need to recognize we have a little bit less revenue coming in. So this won't go away at the end of this quarter or the next quarter. It's something we're just going to continue to keep top of mind, and at same time, never put the mission and the strategy of the organization at risk. Is that helpful?"

Just a couple of comments, and some of this will add on to some of the comments I made in last quarter's results. I think the first thing to keep in mind, as Dan mentioned, we have 1,200 kind of proprietary advisers across the United States. And I think the first thing to remember is they sell across the broad range of products that we offer here in the U.S. And so actually, if you look underneath that, the majority of that systems revenue are actually coming from products that are not impacted by the DOL regulation. That could be, obviously, our life insurance business, disability insurance business, group benefits as well as nonqualified transactions across retirement in PGI. So I think that's the first thing that is great to understand. And then I think underneath that, obviously, the final regs do have a path forward for proprietary products. And even today, our affiliated advisers already have choice between different types of products as well as different proprietary and nonproprietary offerings. And so we think that puts us in a good stead to continue to offer them a competitive set of products and solutions, but also put us in a good stead going forward. I spend a lot of time with these advisers, and I continue to have confidence that they already properly evaluate their customers' needs and make recommendations that are in the best interest of the customer. And I think even though this is going to put some additional compliance and monitoring relative to that, as we leverage the bias for both our retail and retirement plan business, I do feel that both the current business model of those advisers as well as the processes and training we'll be putting in place really do provide a path forward for this part of the business and how it interacts with all of our product solutions."

And we're actually really, really confident in our ability to work with our alliance partners, because we're out there working with them right now. They're going to make decisions about their business model, and we're ready to execute on that. We've already got a couple of things that are in place. We actually have services and products that are in place that already address the DOL rule, levelized commission structure for the broker-dealers. Most of our brokers already use this levelized comp solution that we have. We've already got a 0 revenue share investment platform for both of our fee-based and commission advisers, and that's where we collect administrative fees from participants directly, another solution under the DOL rule. We already have an integrated third-party investment fiduciary service. So that's an example of a product and service that we've had in place for many years, and that's going to directly address the DOL, one of the models that many of our advisers may choose to outsource that third-party investment fiduciary piece. We have a number of in-plan solutions. The new option, obviously, for all of us in the industry, is what we call the BIC, the best interest contract. And as we're out there talking to our distribution partners, we're finding that many of them are going to look and probably execute under the BIC. So we're working with them to help design our end of that equation that then hooks into their end of that equation. The platform exception is one other example. Prepackaged investments, we're having discussions around that. So bottom line is we've got a lot that's already in place, and actually, we've been executing on it for a number of years, and we're out there with our alliance partners. Many, many of them may be leaning to the BIC, and we'll be ready to go on that front."

In the mutual fund business, the adverse impact for the business, generally, will be around moves towards lower-cost share classes. And for us, a move to lower-cost share classes basically means share classes without a 12b-1 fee or a front-end load. But that move has been going on anyway for several years. For example, 70% of our A shares in our mutual fund business are already load waived. So it's a pretty small minority of our mutual funds where we have a front-end load. That will eventually go away, perhaps accelerated by the implications of the DOL rule. But it's a pretty small amount for us, and currently, we're collecting around $5 million annually from the entire front-end loads. So that is a pretty modest impact and it will go away gradually. On the 12b-1s, those are basically a pass-through for our business. They're a way that advisers get paid and that is passed through by the fund company. So the effect on -- of 12b-1s going away should in the end be negligible over the period it happens. So we don't see that as having a big implication. It's all part of the general fee erosion which is happening in mutual funds, which just means we have to get more efficient. I think also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of opportunities. One is if you look around at retirement platforms in the industry generally, there may be a move away from poorer-performing or less-well-designed proprietary products. That will be an opportunity for us to offer our products on a Defined Contribution, Investment Only basis, and we are increasing our resources devoted to finding those clients. And secondly, on the efficiency point, I'd remind you we did a business integration announced early last year of our funds company with Principal Global Investors. That is enabling us to grow the business without adding costs. It wasn't done as a cost take-out. We haven't had any reduction in force consequent on that integration. But it's an opportunity for us to gradually redeploy people, become more efficient and actually do more business with our existing team."

A lot of what we have is going to be able to be modified to work. And then lastly, I would tell you, we're on our front foot in working with our distribution partners. They embrace the conversation. They want to have the conversation, and we're feeling pretty optimistic about how we can work our way through the deal all right. Any additional comments?"

We'd look at this as a balanced approach of capital deployment to our long-term shareholder strategy and value. Most of our businesses, like we talked about in the past, are fee-based businesses, which generates a lot more of that capital -- earnings that are available. As you look at that $800 million to $1 billion, we've already made a pretty good dent in it already in terms of capital that we've deployed in the first half of the year as well as we committed to. We announced our increase in the third quarter dividend up to $0.41. We're pleased with that. We're progressing towards that 40% payout ratio. We're continuing to move towards that. We -- acquisitions, we put more into the boutique strategy, which is part of our long-term strategy, buying part of additional shares of Finisterre, Origin, CCI as well as Claritas. That's a good, consistent process that we've been having in place for a long time. The share buyback program, you're aware that we had a $400 million authorization in February. We're executing on that. As I stated in the comments that we've executed -- we still have $250 million of authorization going forward. And so far, what we've deployed and committed is over $600 million, in so far. Now we have options for the rest of the year, where hopefully, we'll pay out a dividend in the fourth quarter, which we assume will happen. In M&A activity, we're always looking for options and opportunities there. Share buybacks, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, $250 million of that authorization. With the low interest rate environment right now, Suneet, there's some opportunities. There's some opportunities to actually execute on some of our debt maturities that we have coming up. We have in 2017, we have $300 million, and that's at a 1.8% coupon. 2019, we have a $350 million, which is at a high 8 7/8% coupon. So we have an opportunity to actually execute on that, enhance the overall return of the organization and reduce our leverage ratio. As right now, we're under 24%. We're marching towards 20%. So we have options. Now are we going to exceed that $1 billion? No, I can't say at this point in time, because, as I mentioned, share buybacks and some of those other opportunities will continue to unfold as the year goes on. But if you look back to last year, if you look back to 2015, we said that $800 million to $1 billion, and we were a little bit over that at $1,070,000,000, which was about 90% of our net income. So we're continuing to deploy capital in what we believe is a balanced approach to enhance the long-term shareholder value. So stay tuned."

This morning, I'll of focus my comments on 3 areas: Our characterized results for third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2016. Our share some thoughts on execution of highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach to expand our product and service solution set. I'll close with some thoughts on some certain external factors and how they're impacting our outlook for the future. 
I'm very pleased with the third quarter results with reported operating earnings of $336 million. Excluding significant variances, we had double-digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year-ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter, including the annual actuarial assumption review later in the call. 
Compared to a year ago, we increased assets under management, or AUM, by some $80 billion or 15%, bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter. As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term MorningStar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. As of the September 30, 90% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trust were above the medium for the 3-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3- and 5-year performance. Though our 3- and 5-year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the 1-year number with 59% of funds above median is of its highest. 
Because of investment needs of our customers, we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We've created a leading array of multi-asset, multi-manager outcomes oriented solutions, and we purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and non-correlation for different teams within key asset classes. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to standout among active managers in both performance and net cash flows. 
With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a seventh consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. 
Our track record of positive net cash flows during the same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography and strong integration of our businesses, enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. 
As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth. Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures, we have managed expenses and improved margins driving growth and operating earnings compared to a year ago. I'm particularly proud of this result in light of 8% higher-average AUM on a year-to-date basis. The additional cost implemented Department of Labor's fiduciary rule as we quantified in last quarter's call and increased investment in key areas, including technology, product development and our global brand. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night, we've increased our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year. 
Moving to execution, I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter, we've launched 5 new funds, bringing year-to-date launches to 9. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging market middle-class, potential regulatory disruption and the trends toward lost cost product structures. We remain purposeful on our approach building out 4 key areas: Our suite of outcomes-based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower-cost options and provide cost-effective alternatives to passive management. 
Beyond our investment platform, we're also highly focused on digital solutions that are: Simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action allow easier decision-making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisers. 
Throughout 2016, I've shared some initial success with recently launched digital enrollment solutions like Ezi like [ph], the my virtual couch. As another example, we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch, we received 2,400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within Specialty Benefits. 
Moving to distribution. We continue to make meaningful progress towards getting our funds on third-party platforms, recommended list and model portfolios. Through 9 months, we've had more than 40 placements in total, putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms with success across asset classes. 
I also want to comment on the joint venture with China Construction Bank. While not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments, meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature. The result illustrates 2 important points: One, the magnitude of the opportunity in China; and two, the power of our partnership with China Construction Bank, even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third-largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International with a trailing 12 months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. 
I'll close by sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost, we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly, we're also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain headwinds beginning to abate. First, I'll express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016, the tied seems to be turning at the region's largest economy with the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark equity index, the BOVESPA, strengthening. Our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter. 
On the continued strength of Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil, generated at least $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly, we're taking market share from the next 2 largest competitors. 
Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil is gaining traction as well, delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. Despite recent press, we remained optimistic about Chile, our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction. 
To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are once again reviewing the merger of 2 legal entities in Chile, they gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2015. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. 
Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior-level officials in Chile. There's increasing awareness of the pressure on pay-as-you-go systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer. In turn, they're increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income and retirement. We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and an active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world. Additionally, lower-for-longer interest rates present an opportunity and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions, including guarantees to meet the increasing demand for yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate-sensitive than many of our peers. 
Lastly, while the deal wealth fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter, one of our top third party distributors communicate a decision to reduce their approved record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. And we expect this consolidation trend to continue. In the meantime, we'll continue to strengthen the relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. 
In closing, our business fundamentals remains strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through 9 months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We've again made meaningful progress toward enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening the relationship with customers and advisers. I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum, to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?"

This morning, I'll provide commentary on: Operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016, up 6% over the year ago quarter, driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM. Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 billion in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. 
As shown on Slide 6, there were 3 significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of: Our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements; a single large real estate sale; and higher-than-expected and encaje returns in Principal International. 
Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected: A lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other refinements to our actuarial models. As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates. The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy that can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $35 million. Third quarter operating earnings also benefited from higher-than-expected encaje performance in Chile and increased reported pretax operating earnings by $8 million. 
Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances and operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year-ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. 
Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year-ago quarter. Excluding significant variances in both periods, earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17% from the prior year period. 
At the end of the third quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, this measure was approximately 14% in both third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 8 with which Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS Fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased 57% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year-ago quarter. This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. 
The fundamentals of the business remains strong as RIS-Fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by: Quarterly sales of $2.7 billion; a 7% increase in recurring deposits from the prior year quarter; and continued strong plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, RIS-Fee's trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS spread reported third quarter earnings of $76 million, up 52% over the year-ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, RIS spread third quarter pretax operating earnings were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. 
Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame, driving growth in net revenue. 
Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales, while pension buyout and Investment Only businesses continue to be opportunistic. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. On a trailing 12-month basis, and excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60%, above our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 10. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter, an 18% increase over the year-ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global Investors. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion with more than $4 billion of positive net cash flows in the third quarter. 
Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful and allowing us to provide value-added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's pretax return on adjusted revenue was 35% and at the higher end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago, including record operating earnings in Brasilprev. 
encaje performance was higher-than-expected during the third quarter 2016 but was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter 2016 pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year-ago quarter. 
Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, excluding significant variances. This is the first time in the past 5 years we've experienced tailwinds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter. As Slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter in Principal International's growth rates. Excluding significant variances and on a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Principal International's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from Southeast Asia. 
While not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Principal International's trailing 12-month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38%, and within our guided range. 
On Slide 12, Specialty Benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $74 million, up 13% over the year-ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, Specialty Benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of in force premium. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting and pricing discipline. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 12% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million. However, excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality, while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15% and was within the guided range. 
Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range. For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million. Credit-related losses remained well below our pricing assumption at $7 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. We've deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, bringing the fourth quarter dividend to $0.43 per share. 
We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility. While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. 
As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage through the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth and expenses accordingly and as we focus on balancing growth and profitability, while still investing in our businesses. As a result, our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months. 
In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments, third quarter was another strong quarter adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year and 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015. So again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail. We've been in Chile now since 1995. There's a 21-year history of providing Chileans with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance, we have strong customer service, we're well positioned in Chile to continue to do that. We employed 1,500 individuals down there that go work every day, trying to strengthen that program. And again, as you noted in my prepared comments, we've had this [indiscernible] now twice. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, on a very, very stretch, if you will, I'll have a Terry comment on the tax implications, if it were to be overturned."

As a result of that merger, we were allowed to amortize or reflect the amortization of the intangible in our tax calculation. That amount was $105 million at that point in time. And we ran it through an other after-tax adjustment. Now that would be reflected over a 7- to 10-year period on a quarterly basis. So it wasn't going to have a significant impact in any one particular period. But if we were to have that overturned, we would have to unwind that $105 million. And again, we'd probably run it through another after-tax adjustment as we did in -- when we recognize the benefit. Hopefully that helps."

And talking about out of flows in Chile that you might see in our Pages 16 in the supplement. It's important to say that if you're paying attention now, our ability to put inflows remains intact in the $1.4 billion level. So the program we have had is certainly about outflows during this particular quarter. 2 main factors that are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile is making the more customer have and are anticipating their retirement decisions, so they're thinking their money out from the AFPs and mostly they're buying in a compulsory annuity in an asset payout vehicle in life insurance companies. That is one factor that which -- has affected the industry and is affecting Cuprum as well. The second thing is further market aggressiveness and the transferred marketing in DSPs. Certainly, they're using and abusing about this window opportunity that the headlines and presses providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid. Investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry. So we're taking care all of all that. And I'm saying that our people is paying all attention about that and as I'm same saying, we continue to process [ph] good inflows and we're paying a lot of attention about these 2 factors. Happy for that. It's important to remain, Sean, that in Cuprum, we don't charge fees over AUMs. We charge -- instead, we charge fees over flows on contributions and monthly contributions. So this affect particularly, specifically, what happened last quarter has a very marginal impact in our financials."

We look at all the experienced adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do. And if you recall, in 2012, in 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down but probably more importantly, we changed the trajectory in order to get to that longer-term rates. We went from relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and will be across the yield curve. And it will also reflect not only what the risk-free rate is, but it'll also have an impact on -- for the spread that we have, the default rate that goes into the assumption, which we don't disclose any of that information as for pricing and for proprietary purposes. But to try to give you a little bit of maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy of the yield curve, we talk about the 10-year treasury and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use. A year ago, when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis point increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now the expectation then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year. But as you're very well aware, instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think, we take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we're hearing from auditors, what we're hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments, we take all these things into consideration and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time. We have actually moved out and keeping that time period, that 10-year time period in order to get to long-term rate consistent from a different starting point. So you'll look at going out into the future. What we're hearing at anecdotally, what we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well. But still, we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. Hopefully that helps."

If I look at the industry in institutional, the fee pressure depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a sort of rule of thumb, over the last 3 to 4 years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved. When you look at large scale, large core assets and fixed income and equities, where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure and then the industry, those maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area, however, of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets. And those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private; high-yield; other investment grade fixed income; and preferreds, all of which are areas we're strong in. And that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant relative to assets compared with most of the industry. So we have some carefully chosen less liquid categories for active management who still pays and for client's benefit from and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance. But the other piece to this in terms of our fees are going is our strength in multi-asset, multi-manager strategies, which are designed to produce an outcome as desired by clients. Here, I think, target date, target risk, diversified income, Diversified Real Asset, those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commoditized path of -- on core areas. So we feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down. But I would say that relative to the industry, we feel very well-placed."

One is in the retirement area, tremendous scale with regard to services and record keeping din and that platform, just tremendous scale. And with the consolidation in the industry, we're going to be a net gainer on that front. Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise, well, 2 pieces of it. One is what we call total retirement suite. We are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one-stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, or your Aesop plan and that is hugely valuable to our planned sponsors and our advisers with regard to that one-stop shopping. Three, and this is another critical piece is, we have one of the most extensive lineups of target date funds in the U.S. and they're multi-managed, which is a real benefit in this environment, multi-managed and hybrid. In other words, the choice not only around sub-advisers but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice and what we've seen is plan sponsors really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one-stop shopping in addition to that qualified default options."

The pension system, as you know, is the golden standard in system ability but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy. And the most important problem is the one that's created the -- this kind of social  interest that you have seen is some pillar 0 that has nothing to do with the ASPs. The pillar that's being called a [indiscernible] pillar and then which the government is in charge of, that pillar is very much more the one that's providing safety net for low income segment in Chile. And most of this low income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force If they were, they had a few contribution ASP system. For you to know this government, many governments even in the past, they have to think or they took kind of a free ride with the venture system. The total governor retirement expenditure in the pillar 0 is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for OECD countries is about 18% up to 20%. So here, we have the most important issue about adequacy in the pension system. The Chilean government, they sent very quickly the build in order to raise their minimum pensions in pillar 0 up to 10% last week. So they reacting very quickly. Having [indiscernible] the government has to pay a lot of attention about pillar 0 and pillar 0 and that's where most important issue of this about this whole discussion are going with. The second thing that we have to address in Chile and this discussion is about the self-employed segment. They're not well covered. They don't have any compulsory contribution. They don't belong to any system, and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the ASP system, which is our pillar 1, still they sort of go 10% concentration rate over salary. I mean, it's absolutely insufficient longer -- I mean, lower for longer is an issue for every place and Chileans are living longer as well. Also, they do have a salary cut. And the salary cut remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was kept; today, more than 20% of that labor cost is kept. 35% of our customers in Cuprum's are cut. So the 10% over your salaries is even lower than 10%. So we have to address the 10%, we're advocating for a 15% minimum and to remove the salary cut. The third issue is to reinforce the pillar 2 which is a workplace solutions and group solutions in that country. And we have, I would say, good and fairly trained, or to put -- to put those, I will say, improvements. But I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good, I will say, a pension reform. And I think that it's very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through. I'm absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018."

So we really do think that the system has to charge fees over AUMs. On average today, that discussion is going to help us in order to make much more clear but the pension system in Chile is one of the most efficient and cheapest around the 27 pensions plan that has been reviewed by Mercer in their annual review, on average, the pension system charge 60 basis points over AUMs. And in the case of the Cuprum, we charge a number, which is lower than that."

That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated. And the last piece is our ability to provide lifetime income to retirees. Again, all 3 of those are key components in this strategy. I don't think chile is any different than the U.S. in the DOL debates that we're having today or some of the same challenges around the rest of the world whether it was conversation in Hong Kong. There is an outcry, I would suggest, about making sure that the fees are appropriate and just like in the case of Chile and Hong Kong and U.S., there's conversations with the DOL and in the various regulators around the world to make sure that they understand the products and services that are being provided for by the services companies. And we all know, and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the handholding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education and advice on some instances is really the lifeblood of this business model around the world. And so as Luis was articulating, we've spent a lot of the time around the world educating regulators that there needs to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products. So the answer to your specific question, we're getting some outflows today in Chile in large part, I believe, because some of the protest that were large 6 weeks ago that continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating, I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we've made in Chile.

What we try to these is we try to call out the significant items. In this particular quarter, we talked about 3 significant items, the one being the annual actuarial review that had obviously a volatile number this quarter. But the large real estate sale that we had as well as the encaje performance, we felt that, that was a little bit more transparency, visibility into the volatility that we've seen. In terms of volatility, I talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity, generating anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 EPS. This quarter, we were significantly higher than that, well, north of $0.12, $0.13. And so actually, that's the volatility that we called out, brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece. But as I said, you'll have periods where your alternative investments might be a little bit higher, a little bit lower. The general account is actually growing, so you'd see some increase in the net income because of that. But we try to give you the best information possible in terms of the variance or volatility from what we would have expected.

Secondly, we don't see any sort of change as reflects our ability to continue to have a robust investment platform with proprietary investment options being made available to small to medium-sized employers. Certainly requires all the appropriate disclosure. And third, and benefiting that for job changers and retirees again requires disclosure but again, a workable model for the sake of being able to continue to provide our customers with choices at retirement whether they decide to keep the money in the plan, choose to roll over IRA with Principal or to take their funds to a different services provider. And then lastly, as we worked through our own broker-dealer and looking closely at our financial advisers, our 1,500-or-so financial advisers, we're retaining our talent.

And as you point out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions. I wouldn't call Cuprum a tuck-in, but certainly, across asset management and asset accumulation. We've had some really, really nice acquisitions over the years. And I would say that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and we're going to continue to take a larger ownership share of some of the boutiques that we've acquired in the past. You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area that we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies where we've got an existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and may be acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much part of our strategy. We feel like we've had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we'd have to necessarily acquire another funds operation. And in terms of asset classes, we've talked about European real estate. We've talked about strategies that really align with what our investors needs are, which is generating long-term income and retirement and long dated solutions. Infrastructure is another area where we'd look at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive where again, we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs. Is that helpful?"

I'll characterize results for third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2016. I'll share some thoughts on execution highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach and expand our product and service solution set. I'll close with some thoughts on certain external factors and how they're impacting our outlook for the future. 
I'm very pleased with the third quarter results with reported operating earnings of $336 million. Excluding significant variances, we had double-digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter, including the annual actuarial assumption review, later in the call. 
Compared to a year ago, we increased assets under management, or AUM, by some $80 billion or 15%, bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter. As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. As of September 30, 90% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above the median for the 3-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3- and 5-year performance. Though our 3- and 5-year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the 1-year number, with 59% of funds above median, is of its highest. 
Because of investment needs of our customers, we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We've created a leading array of multi-asset, multi-manager, outcomes-oriented solutions, and we purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and noncorrelation for different teams within key asset classes. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to stand out among active managers in both performance and net cash flows. 
With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a seventh consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. 
Our track record of positive net cash flows during the same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model, with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography and strong integration of our businesses, enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. 
While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. 
As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth. Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures, we have managed expenses and improved margins, driving growth in operating earnings compared to a year ago. 
I'm particularly proud of this result in light of 8% higher average AUM on a year-to-date basis; the additional cost to implement the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule as we've quantified in last quarter's call; and increased investment in key areas, including technology, product development and our global brand. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night, we've increased our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year. 
Moving to execution, I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter, we've launched 5 new funds, bringing year-to-date launches to 9. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging market middle class, potential regulatory disruption and the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
We remain purposeful on our approach building out 4 key areas: our suite of outcomes-based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower-cost options and provide cost-effective alternatives to passive management. 
Beyond our investment platform, we're also highly focused on digital solutions that are simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action, allow easier decision-making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisers. 
Throughout 2016, I've shared some initial success with recently launched digital enrollment solutions like Easy Elect [ph] and My Virtual Couch. As another example, we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch, we received 2,400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within Specialty Benefits. 
Moving to distribution. We continue to make meaningful progress towards getting our funds on third-party platforms' recommended list and model portfolios. Through 9 months, we've had more than 40 placements in total, putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms with success across asset classes. 
I also want to comment on the joint venture with China Construction Bank. While not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments, meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature. The result illustrates 2 important points: one, the magnitude of the opportunity in China; and two, the power of our partnership with China Construction Bank, even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third-largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International, with a trailing 12-months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. 
I'll close by sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost, we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly, we're also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain headwinds beginning to abate. 
First, I'll express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016, the tide seems to be turning in the region's largest economy, with the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark equity index, the BOVESPA, strengthening. Our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter. 
On the continued strength of Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil would generate at least $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly, we're taking market share from the next 2 largest competitors. 
Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, is gaining traction as well, delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. 
Despite recent press, we remain optimistic about Chile. Our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction. To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are, once again, reviewing the merger of 2 legal entities in Chile that gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2015. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice, and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. 
Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior-level officials in Chile. There's increasing awareness of the pressure on pay-as-you-go systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer. In turn, they're increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income in retirement. 
We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and an active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world. Additionally, lower-for-longer interest rates present an opportunity, and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions, including guarantees, to meet the increasing demand for yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate-sensitive than many of our peers. 
Lastly, while the DOL fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter, one of our top third party distributors communicate a decision to reduce their approved record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. In the meantime, we'll continue to strengthen relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. 
In closing, our business fundamentals remain strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through 9 months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We've again made meaningful progress towards enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening relationship with customers and advisers.  I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?"

This morning, I'll provide commentary on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016, up 6% over the year ago quarter, driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM. Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 billion in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. 
As shown on Slide 6, there were 3 significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements, a single large real estate sale and higher-than-expected encaje returns in Principal International. 
Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other refinements to our actuarial models. 
As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates. The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy but can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $35 million. Third quarter operating earnings also benefited from higher-than-expected encaje performance in Chile and increased reported pretax operating earnings by $8 million. 
Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances in operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. 
Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year ago quarter. Excluding significant variances in both periods, earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17% from the prior year period. 
At the end of the third quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, this measure was approximately 14% in both third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 8 with Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased 57% from the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year ago quarter. This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. 
The fundamentals of the business remains strong as RIS-Fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by quarterly sales of $2.7 billion, a 7% increase in recurring deposits from the prior year quarter and continued strong plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, RIS-Fee's trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread reported third quarter operating earnings of $76 million, up 52% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, RIS-Spread third quarter pretax operating earnings were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. 
Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame, driving growth in net revenue. 
Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales, while pension buyout in Investment Only businesses continue to be opportunistic. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. On a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60%, above our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 10. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter, an 18% increase over the year ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global Investors. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion with more than $4 billion of positive net cash flows in the third quarter.  Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful in allowing us to provide value-added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's pretax return on adjusted revenue was 35% and at the higher end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago quarter, including record operating earnings in Brasilprev. 
encaje performance was higher-than-expected during third quarter 2016 but was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter 2016 pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year ago quarter. 
Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, excluding significant variances.  This is the first time in the past 5 years we've experienced tailwinds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter. 
As Slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter in Principal International's growth rates. Excluding significant variances and on a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Principal International's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from Southeast Asia. 
While not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Principal International's trailing 12-month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% and within our guided range. 
On Slide 12, Specialty Benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $74 million, up 13% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter, driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, Specialty Benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of in force premium. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting and pricing discipline. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 12% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million. However, excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality, while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15% and was within the guided range. 
Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range.  For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million. Credit-related losses remained well below our pricing assumptions at $7 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. We've deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, bringing the fourth quarter dividend to $0.43 per share. 
We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy, looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility. 
While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. 
As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage through the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth in expenses accordingly as we focus on balancing growth and profitability while still investing in our businesses. As a result, our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months. 
In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments, third quarter was another strong quarter, adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year and 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015. So again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail. We've been in Chile now since 1995. There's a 21-year history of providing Chileans with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance. We have strong customer service. We're well positioned in Chile to continue to do that. We employed 1,500 individuals down there that go work every day, trying to strengthen that program.

In talking about our outflows in Chile that you may see now were Pages 16 in the supplement, it's important to say that if you're paying attention now, our ability [ph] to put inflows remains intact in the $1.4 billion level. So the problem that we have had is certainly about outflows during this particular quarter. Two main factors that are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile, is making then more customer have and are anticipating their retirement decisions. So they're taking their money out from the AFPs and mostly they're buying in a compulsory annuity in a asset payout vehicle in life insurance companies. That is one factor that -- which is affecting the industry and is affecting Cuprum as well. The second thing is a further market aggressiveness and the transfer market in the AFPs. Certainly, they're using and abusing about this window opportunity that the headlines and press is providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid. Investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry. So we're taking care of all that, and I'm saying that our people is paying a lot of attention about that. And as I'm saying, we continue to the present good inflows and we're paying a lot of attention about these 2 factors. Having said that, it's important to remember, Sean, that in Cuprum, we don't charge fees over AUMs. We charge -- instead, we charge fees over flows on contributions, in monthly contributions. So this affect particularly -- specifically like what happened the last quarter, has a very marginal impact in our financials."

We look at all the experience adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do. And if you recall, in 2012, in 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down, but probably more importantly, we changed their trajectory in order to get to that longer-term rate. We went from relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and will be across the yield curve, and it will also reflect not only what the risk-free rate is but it'll also have an impact on the -- for the spread that we have, the default rate that goes into the assumption, which we don't disclose any of that information as -- for pricing and for proprietary purposes. But to try to give you a little bit of -- maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy, a proxy of the yield curve, we talked about the 10-year treasury and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use. A year ago, when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis point increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now the expectation then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year. But as you're very well aware, the -- instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think, we take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we're hearing from auditors, what we're hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments. We take all these things into consideration, and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time. We have actually moved out in keeping that time period, that 10-year time period, in order to get to our long-term rate consistent through -- from a different starting point, so you'll look at going out into the future. What we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well. But still, we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. Hopefully that helps."

Now having said that, we're also continuing to make some very significant investments around digital and technology. Certainly, we've talked about the expenses related to the DOL implementation.

If I look at the industry in institutional, the fee pressures depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a sort of rule of thumb, over the last 3 to 4 years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved. When you look at large scale, large core assets in fixed income and equities, where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure, and then the industry, those maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area, however, of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets, and those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade, and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private, high-yield, other investment grade fixed income and preferreds; all of which are areas we're strong in. And that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant relative to assets compared with most of the industry. So we have some carefully chosen, less liquid categories for active management still pay [ph] and for client's benefit from it and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance. But the other piece to this, in terms of where fees are going, is our strength in multi-asset, multi-manager strategies, which are designed to produce an outcome as desired by clients. Here, I think, target date, target risk, diversified income, diversified real asset. Those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commoditized passive and core areas. So we feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down. But I would say that relative to the industry, we feel very well-placed."

Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise -- well, 2 pieces of it. One is what we call Total Retirement Suite. We are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one-stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, your nonqual and you ESOP plan, and that is hugely valuable to our plan sponsors and our advisers with regard to that one-stop shopping. Three, and this is another critical piece, is we have one of the most extensive lineups of target-date funds in the U.S. and they're multi-managed, which is a real benefit in this environment. Multi-managed and hybrid, in other words, the choice not only around sub-advisers but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice, and what we've seen is plan sponsors really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one-stop shopping in addition to that qualified default option."

That -- it",615,"Yes. Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it might sounds to you a little bit counterintuitive, but I have to say also that Principal, since the early 2000, we're been a strong advocator in order to review the pension reform in Chile in a much more comprehensive way, as I said. The pension system, as you know, is the golden standard in sustainability, but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy. And the most important problem is the one that's created the -- this kind of social unrest that you have seen. It's Pillar 0 that has nothing to do with the AFPs. It's the pillar that's being called the Solidarity Pillar and in which the government is in charge of. That pillar is very much more the one that's provide a safety net for low-income segment in Chile. And most of this low-income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force. If they were, they had a few contribution to the AFP system. For you to know this government, many governments even in the past, they have think or they took a kind of free ride with the pension system. The total government retirement expenditure in the Pillar O is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for OECD countries is about 18% up to 20%. So here, we have the most important issue about adequacy in this pension system. The Chilean government, they sent very quickly a bill in order to raise their minimum pensions in Pillar 0 up to 10% last week. So they're reacting very quickly. Having said that, the government has to pay a lot of attention about Pillar O and Pillar 0, and that's where the most important initiatives about this whole discussion are going with. The second thing that we have to address in Chile, in this discussion is about the self-employed segment. They're not well covered. They don't have any compulsory contribution. They don't belong to any system and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the AFP system, which are Pillar 1. Still, they start to do 10% contribution rate over salary. I mean, it's absolutely insufficient. Longer for -- I mean, lower for longer is an issue for every place, and Chileans are living longer as well. Also, they do have a salary cap, and their salary cut remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was capped. Today, more than 20% of the labor cost is capped. 35% of our customers in Cuprum's are capped. So the 10% over your salary is even lower than 10%. So we have to address the 10%. We're advocating for a 15% minimum and to remove the salary cap. The third issue is to reinforce the Pillar 2, which is the workplace solutions and group solutions in that country. And we have, I would say, good and fairly trained in order to put and -- to put those, I will say, improvements. But I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good, I will say, a pension reform. And I think that it's very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through. I'm absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018."

I guess the way I'd go at this is to again remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated. And the last piece is our ability to provide lifetime income to retirees. Again, all 3 of those are key components in the strategy. I don't think Chile is any different than the U.S., in the DOL debates that we're having today or some of the same challenges around the rest of the world, whether it was a conversation in Hong Kong. There is an outcry, I would suggest, about making sure that the fees are appropriate. And just like in the case of Chile and Hong Kong and U.S., there's conversation with the DOL and the various regulators around the world to make sure that they understand the products and services that are being provided for by the services companies. And we all know and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the handholding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education and advice, in some instances, is really the lifeblood of this business model around the world. And so as Luis was articulating, we've spent a lot of the time around the world educating regulators that there needs to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products. So to answer your specific question, we're getting some outflows today in Chile, in large part, I believe, because some of the protests that were large 6 weeks ago that continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating. I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we've made in Chile. Hopefully that helps."

What we try to do is we try to call out the significant items. In this particular quarter, we talked about 3 significant items, the one being the annual actuarial review that had obviously a volatile number this quarter. But the large real estate sale that we had as well as the encaje performance, we felt that, that was a little bit more transparency, visibility into the volatility that we've seen. In terms of volatility, we -- I've talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity generating anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 EPS. This quarter, we were significantly higher than that of well north of $0.12, $0.13. And so actually, that volatility that we called out brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece. But as I said, you'll have periods where the alternative investments might be a little bit higher, a little bit lower. The general account is actually growing, so you'd see some increase in the net income because of that. But we try to give you the best information possible in terms of the variance or volatility from what we would have expected. So the $1.22 that we had is the run rate that we believe is an appropriate number for this quarter."

And we're seeing a full range and a lot of discussion around that. And again, we were anticipating that, and we would expect it. Secondly, we don't see any sort of change as reflects our ability to continue to have a robust investment platform with proprietary investment options being made available to small to medium-sized employers, certainly requires all the appropriate disclosure. And third, a benefit event for job changers and retirees, again, requires disclosure, but again, a workable model for the sake of being able to continue to provide our customers with choices at retirement, whether they decide to keep the money in the plan, choose a rollover IRA with Principal or to take their funds to a different services provider. And then lastly, as we've worked through our own broker-dealer and looking closely at our financial advisers, our 1,500-or-so financial advisers, we're retaining our talent. They have found what we have shared with them as a workable solution to allow them to continue to have a successful practice here at Principal.

Thanks for the question, Michael. That's probably a 30-minute response, but I'll give a relatively brief response, in that what I would say is we have tried to really have a disciplined approach to capital deployment, whether it's to increase our dividends, stock buyback, making investments in our organic growth strategies here at Principal, being very cautious about, even within the organic lines, allocating net capital, where we can -- where we feel the shareholder is benefiting the most. And as you pointed out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions. I wouldn't call Cuprum a tuck-in, but certainly, across asset management and asset accumulation, we've had some really, really nice acquisitions over the years. And I would say that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and we're going to continue to take a larger ownership share in some of the boutiques that we've acquired in the past. You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area that we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies, where we've got an existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and maybe acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much part of our strategy. We feel like we've had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we'd have to necessarily acquire another fund's operation. And in terms of asset classes, we've talked about European real estate. We've talked about strategies that really align with what our investors' needs are, which is generating long-term income in retirement and long-dated solutions. Infrastructure is another area where we'd look at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive where, again, we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs.

Welcome to Principal Financial Group's third quarter conference call.
As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com/investor. Due to the annual actuarial assumption review and other significant variances at this quarter, we posted some additional materials on the website, including comparison of quarterly operating earnings, excluding significant variances from the third quarter 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. Keep in mind, our reporting structure changed in the fourth quarter 2015. 
Following a reading of the safe harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Terry Lillis will deliver some prepared remarks. Then we'll open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A include Nora Everett, Retirement and Income Solutions; Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors; Luis Valdés, Principal International; Deanna Strable, U.S. Insurance Solutions; and Tim Dunbar, our Chief Investment Officer.

I'll characterize results for third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2016. I'll share some thoughts on execution highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach and expand our product and service solution set. I'll close with some thoughts on certain external factors and how they're impacting our outlook for the future. 
I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. With reported operating earnings of $336 million, excluding significant variances, we had double-digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter, including the annual actuarial assumption review, later in the call. 
Compared to a year ago, we increased assets under management, or AUM, by some $80 billion or 15%, bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter. As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. As of September 30, 90% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above the median for the 3-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3- and 5-year performance. Though our 3- and 5-year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the 1-year number, with 59% of funds above median, is of its highest. 
Because of investment needs of our customers, we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We've created a leading array of multi-asset, multi-manager, outcomes-oriented solutions, and we purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and noncorrelation for different teams within key asset classes. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to stand out among active managers in both performance and net cash flows. 
With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a seventh consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. 
Our track record of positive net cash flows during the same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model, with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography, and strong integration of our businesses, enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. 
While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. 
As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth. Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures, we have managed expenses and improved margins, driving growth in operating earnings compared to a year ago. 
I'm particularly proud of this result in light of 8% higher average AUM on a year-to-date basis; the additional cost to implement the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule as we've quantified in last quarter's call; and increased investment in key areas, including technology, product development and our global brand. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night, we've increased our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year. 
Moving to execution, I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter, we've launched 5 new funds, bringing year-to-date launches to 9. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging-market middle class, potential regulatory disruption and the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
We remain purposeful on our approach building out 4 key areas: our suite of outcomes-based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower-cost options and provide cost-effective alternatives to passive management. 
Beyond our investment platform, we're also highly focused on digital solutions that are simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action, allow easier decision-making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisers. 
Throughout 2016, I've shared some initial success with recently launched digital enrollment solutions like Easy Elect [ph] and My Virtual Couch. As another example, we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch, we received 2,400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within Specialty Benefits. 
Moving to distribution. We continue to make meaningful progress towards getting our funds on third-party platforms' recommended list and model portfolios. Through 9 months, we've had more than 40 placements in total, putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms, with success across asset classes. 
I also want to comment on the joint venture with China Construction Bank. While not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments, meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature. The result illustrates 2 important points: one, the magnitude of the opportunity in China; and two, the power of our partnership with China Construction Bank, even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third-largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International, with a trailing 12-months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. 
I'll close by sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost, we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly, we're also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain headwinds beginning to abate. 
First, I'll express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016, the tide seems to be turning in the region's largest economy, with the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark equity index, the BOVESPA, strengthening. Our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter. 
On the continued strength of Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil, we generated at least $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly, we're taking market share from the next 2 largest competitors. 
Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, is gaining traction as well, delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. 
Despite recent press, we remain optimistic about Chile. Our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction. To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are, once again, reviewing the merger of 2 legal entities in Chile that gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2015. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice, and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. 
Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior-level officials in Chile. There's increasing awareness of the pressure on pay-as-you-go systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer. In turn, they're increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income in retirement. 
We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and an active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world. Additionally, lower-for-longer interest rates present an opportunity, and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions, including guarantees, to meet the increasing demand for yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate-sensitive than many of our peers. 
Lastly, while the DOL fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter, one of our top third-party distributors communicate a decision to reduce their approved record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. In the meantime, we'll continue to strengthen relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. 
In closing, our business fundamentals remain strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through 9 months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We've again made meaningful progress towards enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening the relationship with customers and advisers. I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?"

This morning, I'll provide commentary on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016, up 6% over the year ago quarter, driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM. Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 billion in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. 
As shown on Slide 6, there were 3 significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements, a single large real estate sale and higher-than-expected encaje returns in Principal International. 
Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other refinements to our actuarial models. 
As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates. The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy but can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $35 million. Third quarter operating earnings also benefited from higher-than-expected encaje performance in Chile and increased reported pretax operating earnings by $8 million. 
Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances in operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. 
Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year ago quarter. Excluding significant variances in both periods, earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17% from the prior year period. 
At the end of the third quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, this measure was approximately 14% in both third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 8, with Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased 57% from the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year ago quarter. This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. 
The fundamentals of the business remain strong as RIS-Fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by quarterly sales of $2.7 billion, a 7% increase in recurring deposits from the prior year quarter and continued strong plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, RIS-Fee's trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread reported third quarter operating earnings of $76 million, up 52% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, RIS-Spread third quarter pretax operating earnings were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. 
Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame, driving growth in net revenue. 
Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales, while pension buyout in investment-only businesses continue to be opportunistic. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. On a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60%, above our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 10. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter, an 18% increase over the year ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global Investors. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion, with more than $4 billion of positive net cash flows in the third quarter.  Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful in allowing us to provide value-added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's pretax return on adjusted revenue was 35% and at the higher end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago quarter, including record operating earnings in Brasilprev. 
encaje performance was higher-than-expected during third quarter 2016 but was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter 2016 pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year ago quarter. 
Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, excluding significant variances.  This is the first time in the past 5 years we've experienced tailwinds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter. 
As Slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter in Principal International's growth rates. Excluding significant variances and on a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Principal International's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from Southeast Asia. 
While not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Principal International's trailing 12-month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% and within our guided range. 
On Slide 12, Specialty Benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $74 million, up 13% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter, driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, Specialty Benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of in force premium. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting and pricing discipline. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 12% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million. However, excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality, while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15% and was within the guided range. 
Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range.  For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million. Credit-related losses remained well below our pricing assumptions at $7 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. We've deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, bringing the fourth quarter dividend to $0.43 per share. 
We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy, looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility. 
While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. 
As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage to the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth and expenses accordingly as we focus on balancing growth and profitability while still investing in our businesses. As a result, our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months. 
In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments. Third quarter was another strong quarter, adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year and 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015. So again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail. We've been in Chile now since 1995. There's a 21-year history of providing Chileans with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance. We have strong customer service. We're well positioned in Chile to continue to do that. We employed 1,500 individuals down there that can go work every day, trying to strengthen that program. And again, as you noted in my prepared comments, we've had this codified now twice. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, on a very, very stretch, if you will, I'll have Terry comment on the tax implications, if it were to be overturned."

And we ran it through an other after-tax adjustment. Now that would be reflected over a 7- to 10-year period on a quarterly basis, so it wasn't going to have a significant impact in any one particular period. But if we were to have that overturned, we would have to unwind that $105 million. And again, we'd probably run it through another after-tax adjustment as we did in the -- when we recognized the benefit."

In talking about our outflows in Chile that you may see now, were Pages 16 in the supplement, it's important to say that if you're paying attention now, our ability to put inflows remains intact in the $1.4 billion level. So the problem that we have had is certainly about outflows during this particular quarter. Two main factors that are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile. It's making the -- more customers have and are anticipating their retirement decisions. So they're taking their money out from the AFPs and mostly they're buying in a compulsory annuity in a asset payout vehicle in life insurance companies. That is one factor that -- which is affecting the industry and is affecting Cuprum as well. The second thing is a further market aggressiveness and the transfer market in the AFPs. Certainly, they're using and abusing about this window opportunity that the headlines and press is providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid. Investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry. So we're taking care of all that, and I'm saying that our people is paying a lot of attention about that. And as I'm saying, we continue to present good inflows and we're paying a lot of attention about these 2 factors. Having said that, it's important to remember, Sean, that in Cuprum, we don't charge fees over AUMs. We charge -- instead, we charge fees over flows on contributions, in monthly contributions. So this effect particularly -- specifically like what happened the last quarter, has a very marginal impact in our financials."

We look at all the experience adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do. And if you recall, in 2012 and 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down, but probably more importantly, we changed their trajectory in order to get to that longer-term rate. We went from a relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and will be across the yield curve, and it will also reflect not only what the risk-free rate is, but it'll also have an impact on the -- for the spread that we have, the default rate that goes into the assumption, which we don't disclose any of that information. That's for pricing and for proprietary purposes. But to try to give you a little bit of -- maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy, a proxy of the yield curve, we talked about the 10-year treasury and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use. A year ago, when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis point increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now the expectation then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year. But as you're very well aware, the -- instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think, we take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we're hearing from auditors, what we're hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments. We take all these things into consideration, and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time. We have actually moved out in keeping that time period, that 10-year time period, in order to get to our long-term rate consistent, but we're from a different starting point, so you'll look at going out into the future. What we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well. But still, we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. Hopefully that helps."

So first, let me kind of hit the macro sort of expense initiative that we have, and we've always had a lot of expense discipline around Principal. What we try to do is to make sure, Seth, that we're aligning our expenses with the revenue that we're able to generate. And as part of that process, as you might expect, we rigorously go through the organization to determine if there's services that were provided that are valued by our clients or they're unwilling to pay for. So I would say it's basic blocking and tackling, making sure that we have a disciplined approach to expense management. Now having said that, we're also continuing to make some very significant investments around digital and technology. Certainly, we've talked about the expenses related to the DOL implementation. And we're wanting to make sure we're still planting seeds within all of our businesses so we've got future growth. So I don't want anybody to walk away from the call or the quarter to think that somehow it's taking out all expenses at all cost because that's just not -- it's not the approach that we would take for Principal. So with that as a backdrop as it relates specifically to fee, growth and revenue growth along the lines of business, I'll have Jim go first and then have Nora make some additional comments. Jim?"

If I look at the industry in institutional, the fee pressures depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a sort of rule of thumb, over the last 3 to 4 years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved. When you look at large-scale, large-core assets in fixed income and equities, where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure, and in the industry, those maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area, however, of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets, and those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade, and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private, high-yield, other investment grade fixed income and preferreds; all of which are areas we're strong in. And that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant relative to assets compared with most of the industry. So we have some carefully chosen, less liquid categories where active management still pays and where clients benefit from it and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance. But the other piece to this, in terms of where fees are going, is our strength in multi-asset, multi-manager strategies, which are designed to produce an outcome that's desired by clients. Here, I think, target date, target risk, diversified income, diversified real asset. Those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commoditized passive and core areas. So we feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down. But I would say that relative to the industry, we feel very well-placed."

Tremendous scale with regard to services and record keeping in that platform, just tremendous scale. And with the consolidation in the industry, we're going to be a net gainer on that front. Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise -- well, 2 pieces of it. One is what we call Total Retirement Suite. We are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one-stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, your nonqual and you ESOP plan, and that is hugely valuable to our plan sponsors and our advisers with regard to that one-stop shopping. Three, and this is another critical piece, is we have one of the most extensive lineups of target-date funds in the U.S. and they're multi-managed, which is a real benefit in this environment. Multi-managed and hybrid, in other words, the choice not only around sub-advisers but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice, and what we've seen is plan sponsors really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one-stop shopping in addition to that qualified default option."

Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it",616,"Yes. Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it might sounds to you a little bit counterintuitive, but I have to say also that Principal, since the early 2000, we're been a strong advocator in order to review the pension reform in Chile in a much more comprehensive way, as I said. The pension system, as you know, is the golden standard in sustainability, but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy. And the most important problem is the one that's created the -- this kind of social unrest that you have seen. It's Pillar 0 that has nothing to do with the AFPs. It's the pillar that's being called the Solidarity Pillar and in which the government is in charge of. That pillar is very much more the one that's provided a safety net for low-income segment in Chile. And most of this low-income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force. If they were, they had a few contributions to the AFP system. For you to know this government, many governments even in the past, they hadn't take -- or they took a kind of free ride with the pension system. The total government retirement expenditure in the Pillar O is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for OECD countries is about 18% up to 20%. So here, we have the most important issue about adequacy in this pension system. The Chilean government, they sent very quickly a bill in order to raise their minimum pensions in Pillar 0 up to 10% last week. So they're reacting very quickly. Having said that, the government has to pay a lot of attention about Pillar O and Pillar 0, and that's where the most important initiatives about these whole discussions are going with. The second thing that we have to address in Chile, in this discussion is about the self-employed segment. They're not well covered. They don't have any compulsory contribution. They don't belong to any system and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the AFP system, which are Pillar 1. Still, they start to do 10% contribution rate over salary. I mean, it's absolutely insufficient. Longer for -- I mean, lower for longer is an issue for every place, and Chileans are living longer as well. Also, they do have a salary cap, and their salary cut remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was capped. Today, more than 20% of the labor force is capped. 35% of our customers in Cuprum's are capped. So the 10% over year salary is even lower than 10%. So we have to address the 10%. We're advocating for a 15% minimum and to remove the salary cap. The third issue is to reinforce the Pillar 2, which is the workplace solutions and group solutions in that country. And we have, I would say, good and fairly trained in order to put and -- to put those, I will say, improvements. But I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good, I will say, a pension reform. And I think that it's very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through. I'm absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018."

Around their 27 pensions plan that has been reviewed by Mercer in their annual review, on average, the pension system charge 60 basis point over AUMs. And in the case of Cuprum, we charge a number which is lower than that."

I guess the way I'd go at this is to, again, remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated. And the last piece is our ability to provide lifetime income to retirees. Again, all 3 of those are key components in the strategy. I don't think Chile is any different than the U.S., in the DOL debates that we're having today or some of the same challenges around the rest of the world, whether it was a conversation in Hong Kong. There is an outcry, I would suggest, about making sure that the fees are appropriate. And just like in the case of Chile and Hong Kong and U.S., there's conversation with the DOL and the various regulators around the world to make sure that they understand the products and services that are being provided for by the services companies. And we all know and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the handholding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education and advice, in some instances, is really the lifeblood of this business model around the world. And so as Luis was articulating, we've spent a lot of the time around the world educating regulators that there needs to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products. So to answer your specific question, we're getting some outflows today in Chile, in large part, I believe, because some of the protests that were large 6 weeks ago that continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating. I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we've made in Chile. Hopefully that helps."

That had, obviously, a volatile number this quarter. But the large real estate sale that we had as well as the encaje performance, we felt that, that was a little bit more transparency, visibility into the volatility that we've seen. In terms of volatility, we -- I've talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity generating anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 EPS. This quarter, we were significantly higher than that, well north of $0.12, $0.13. And so actually, this volatility that we called out brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece. But as I said, you'll have periods where the alternative investments might be a little bit higher or a little bit lower. The general account is actually growing, so you'd see some increase in the net income because of that. But we try to give you the best information possible in terms of the variance or volatility from what we would have expected.

So this was the first quarter-over-quarter comparison where we actually saw some benefit from it. I think long term, we have always talked about stability in the dollar. Now we're not actually looking for tailwinds or looking for headwinds, but when you actually reflect it on a constant-currency basis, which I think is the way we want to look at the business, on a constant-currency basis, we're still seeing that mid to upper teens growth rate of our international businesses. It's very strong, and we've been trying to reflect that at a year-over-year basis -- or excuse me, for several quarters. But now we actually have some numbers, when the dollar is relatively stable, that you're actually seeing the growth of that underlying business."

Thanks for the question, Michael. That's probably a 30-minute response, but I'll give a relatively brief response, and what I would say is we have tried to really have a disciplined approach to capital deployment, whether it's to increase our dividends, stock buyback, making investments in our organic growth strategies here at Principal, being very cautious about, even within the organic lines, allocating that capital, where we can -- where we feel the shareholder is benefiting the most. And as you point out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions. I wouldn't call Cuprum a tuck-in, but certainly, across asset management and asset accumulation, we've had some really, really nice acquisitions over the years. And I would say that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and we're going to continue to take a larger ownership share in some of the boutiques that we've acquired in the past. You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area that we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies, where we've got an existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and maybe acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much a part of our strategy. We feel like we've had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we'd have to necessarily acquire another fund's operation. And in terms of asset classes, we've talked about European real estate. We've talked about strategies that really align with what our investors' needs are, which is generating long-term income in retirement and long-dated solutions. Infrastructure is another area where we'd look at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive where, again, we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs. Is that helpful?"

As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com/investor. Due to the annual actuarial assumption review and other significant variances at this quarter, we posted some additional materials on the website, including comparison of quarterly operating earnings, excluding significant variances from the third quarter 2016 compared to the year ago quarter.

I'll characterize results for third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2016. I'll share some thoughts on execution highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach and expand our product and service solution set. I'll close with some thoughts on certain external factors and how they're impacting our outlook for the future. 
I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. With reported operating earnings of $336 million, excluding significant variances, we had double-digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter, including the annual actuarial assumption review, later in the call. 
Compared to a year ago, we increased assets under management, or AUM, by some $80 billion or 15%, bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter. As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. As of September 30, 90% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above the median for the 3-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3- and 5-year performance. Though our 3- and 5-year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the 1-year number, with 59% of funds above median, is of its highest. 
Because of investment needs of our customers, we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We've created a leading array of multi-asset, multi-manager, outcomes-oriented solutions, and we purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and noncorrelation for different teams within key asset classes. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to stand out among active managers in both performance and net cash flows. 
With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a seventh consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. 
Our track record of positive net cash flows during the same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model, with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography, and strong integration of our businesses, enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. 
While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. 
As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth. Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures, we have managed expenses and improved margins, driving growth in operating earnings compared to a year ago. 
I'm particularly proud of this result in light of 8% higher average AUM on a year-to-date basis; the additional cost to implement the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule as we've quantified in last quarter's call; and increased investment in key areas, including technology, product development and our global brand. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night, we've increased our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year. 
Moving to execution, I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter, we've launched 5 new funds, bringing year-to-date launches to 9. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging-market middle class, potential regulatory disruption and the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
We remain purposeful on our approach building out 4 key areas: our suite of outcomes-based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower-cost options and provide cost-effective alternatives to passive management. 
Beyond our investment platform, we're also highly focused on digital solutions that are simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action, allow easier decision-making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisers. 
Throughout 2016, I've shared some initial success with recently launched digital enrollment solutions like Easy Elect [ph] and My Virtual Couch. As another example, we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch, we received 2,400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within Specialty Benefits. 
Moving to distribution. We continue to make meaningful progress towards getting our funds on third-party platforms' recommended list and model portfolios. Through 9 months, we've had more than 40 placements in total, putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms, with success across asset classes. 
I also want to comment on the joint venture with China Construction Bank. While not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments, meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature. The result illustrates 2 important points: one, the magnitude of the opportunity in China; and two, the power of our partnership with China Construction Bank, even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third-largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International, with a trailing 12-months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. 
I'll close by sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost, we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly, we're also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain headwinds beginning to abate. 
First, I'll express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016, the tide seems to be turning in the region's largest economy, with the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark equity index, the BOVESPA, strengthening. Our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter. 
On the continued strength of Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil, we generated at least $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly, we're taking market share from the next 2 largest competitors. 
Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, is gaining traction as well, delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. 
Despite recent press, we remain optimistic about Chile. Our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction. To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are, once again, reviewing the merger of 2 legal entities in Chile that gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2015. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice, and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. 
Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior-level officials in Chile. There's increasing awareness of the pressure on pay-as-you-go systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer. In turn, they're increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income in retirement. 
We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and an active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world. Additionally, lower-for-longer interest rates present an opportunity, and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions, including guarantees, to meet the increasing demand for yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate-sensitive than many of our peers. 
Lastly, while the DOL fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter, one of our top third-party distributors communicate a decision to reduce their approved record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. In the meantime, we'll continue to strengthen relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. 
In closing, our business fundamentals remain strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through 9 months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We've again made meaningful progress towards enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening the relationship with customers and advisers. I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?"

This morning, I'll provide commentary on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016, up 6% over the year ago quarter, driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM. Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 billion in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. 
As shown on Slide 6, there were 3 significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements, a single large real estate sale and higher-than-expected encaje returns in Principal International. 
Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other refinements to our actuarial models. 
As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates. The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy but can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $35 million. Third quarter operating earnings also benefited from higher-than-expected encaje performance in Chile and increased reported pretax operating earnings by $8 million. 
Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances in operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. 
Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year ago quarter. Excluding significant variances in both periods, earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17% from the prior year period. 
At the end of the third quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, this measure was approximately 14% in both third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 8, with Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased 57% from the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year ago quarter. This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. 
The fundamentals of the business remain strong as RIS-Fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by quarterly sales of $2.7 billion, a 7% increase in recurring deposits from the prior year quarter and continued strong plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, RIS-Fee's trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread reported third quarter operating earnings of $76 million, up 52% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, RIS-Spread third quarter pretax operating earnings were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. 
Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame, driving growth in net revenue. 
Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales, while pension buyout in investment-only businesses continue to be opportunistic. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. On a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60%, above our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 10. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter, an 18% increase over the year ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global Investors. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion, with more than $4 billion of positive net cash flows in the third quarter.  Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful in allowing us to provide value-added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's pretax return on adjusted revenue was 35% and at the higher end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago quarter, including record operating earnings in Brasilprev. 
encaje performance was higher-than-expected during third quarter 2016 but was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter 2016 pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year ago quarter. 
Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, excluding significant variances.  This is the first time in the past 5 years we've experienced tailwinds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter. 
As Slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter in Principal International's growth rates. Excluding significant variances and on a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Principal International's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from Southeast Asia. 
While not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Principal International's trailing 12-month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% and within our guided range. 
On Slide 12, Specialty Benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $74 million, up 13% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter, driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, Specialty Benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of in force premium. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting and pricing discipline. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 12% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million. However, excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality, while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15% and was within the guided range. 
Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range.  For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million. Credit-related losses remained well below our pricing assumptions at $7 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. We've deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, bringing the fourth quarter dividend to $0.43 per share. 
We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy, looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility. 
While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. 
As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage to the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth and expenses accordingly as we focus on balancing growth and profitability while still investing in our businesses. As a result, our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months. 
In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments. Third quarter was another strong quarter, adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year and 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015. So again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail. We've been in Chile now since 1995. There's a 21-year history of providing Chileans with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance. We have strong customer service. We're well positioned in Chile to continue to do that. We employed 1,500 individuals down there that can go work every day, trying to strengthen that program. And again, as you noted in my prepared comments, we've had this codified now twice. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, on a very, very stretch, if you will, I'll have Terry comment on the tax implications, if it were to be overturned."

And we ran it through an other after-tax adjustment. Now that would be reflected over a 7- to 10-year period on a quarterly basis, so it wasn't going to have a significant impact in any one particular period. But if we were to have that overturned, we would have to unwind that $105 million. And again, we'd probably run it through another after-tax adjustment as we did in the -- when we recognized the benefit."

In talking about our outflows in Chile that you may see now, were Pages 16 in the supplement, it's important to say that if you're paying attention now, our ability to put inflows remains intact in the $1.4 billion level. So the problem that we have had is certainly about outflows during this particular quarter. Two main factors that are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile. It's making the -- more customers have and are anticipating their retirement decisions. So they're taking their money out from the AFPs and mostly they're buying in a compulsory annuity in a asset payout vehicle in life insurance companies. That is one factor that -- which is affecting the industry and is affecting Cuprum as well. The second thing is a further market aggressiveness and the transfer market in the AFPs. Certainly, they're using and abusing about this window opportunity that the headlines and press is providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid. Investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry. So we're taking care of all that, and I'm saying that our people is paying a lot of attention about that. And as I'm saying, we continue to present good inflows and we're paying a lot of attention about these 2 factors. Having said that, it's important to remember, Sean, that in Cuprum, we don't charge fees over AUMs. We charge -- instead, we charge fees over flows on contributions, in monthly contributions. So this effect particularly -- specifically like what happened the last quarter, has a very marginal impact in our financials."

We look at all the experience adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do. And if you recall, in 2012 and 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down, but probably more importantly, we changed their trajectory in order to get to that longer-term rate. We went from a relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and will be across the yield curve, and it will also reflect not only what the risk-free rate is, but it'll also have an impact on the -- for the spread that we have, the default rate that goes into the assumption, which we don't disclose any of that information. That's for pricing and for proprietary purposes. But to try to give you a little bit of -- maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy, a proxy of the yield curve, we talked about the 10-year treasury and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use. A year ago, when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis point increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now the expectation then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year. But as you're very well aware, the -- instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think, we take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we're hearing from auditors, what we're hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments. We take all these things into consideration, and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time. We have actually moved out in keeping that time period, that 10-year time period, in order to get to our long-term rate consistent, but we're from a different starting point, so you'll look at going out into the future. What we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well. But still, we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. Hopefully that helps."

What we try to do is to make sure, Seth, that we're aligning our expenses with the revenue that we're able to generate. And as part of that process, as you might expect, we rigorously go through the organization to determine if there's services that were provided that are valued by our clients or they're unwilling to pay for. So I would say it's basic blocking and tackling, making sure that we have a disciplined approach to expense management. Now having said that, we're also continuing to make some very significant investments around digital and technology. Certainly, we've talked about the expenses related to the DOL implementation. And we're wanting to make sure we're still planting seeds within all of our businesses so we've got future growth. So I don't want anybody to walk away from the call or the quarter to think that somehow it's taking out all expenses at all cost because that's just not -- it's not the approach that we would take for Principal.

If I look at the industry in institutional, the fee pressures depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a sort of rule of thumb, over the last 3 to 4 years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved. When you look at large-scale, large-core assets in fixed income and equities, where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure, and in the industry, those maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area, however, of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets, and those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade, and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private, high-yield, other investment grade fixed income and preferreds; all of which are areas we're strong in. And that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant relative to assets compared with most of the industry. So we have some carefully chosen, less liquid categories where active management still pays and where clients benefit from it and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance. But the other piece to this, in terms of where fees are going, is our strength in multi-asset, multi-manager strategies, which are designed to produce an outcome that's desired by clients. Here, I think, target date, target risk, diversified income, diversified real asset. Those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commoditized passive and core areas. So we feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down. But I would say that relative to the industry, we feel very well-placed."

Tremendous scale with regard to services and record keeping in that platform, just tremendous scale. And with the consolidation in the industry, we're going to be a net gainer on that front. Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise -- well, 2 pieces of it. One is what we call Total Retirement Suite. We are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one-stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, your nonqual and you ESOP plan, and that is hugely valuable to our plan sponsors and our advisers with regard to that one-stop shopping. Three, and this is another critical piece, is we have one of the most extensive lineups of target-date funds in the U.S. and they're multi-managed, which is a real benefit in this environment. Multi-managed and hybrid, in other words, the choice not only around sub-advisers but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice, and what we've seen is plan sponsors really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one-stop shopping in addition to that qualified default option."

And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it might sounds to you a little bit counterintuitive, but I have to say also that Principal, since the early 2000, we're been a strong advocator in order to review the pension reform in Chile in a much more comprehensive way, as I said. The pension system, as you know, is the golden standard in sustainability, but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy. And the most important problem is the one that's created the -- this kind of social unrest that you have seen. It's Pillar 0 that has nothing to do with the AFPs. It's the pillar that's being called the Solidarity Pillar and in which the government is in charge of. That pillar is very much more the one that's provided a safety net for low-income segment in Chile. And most of this low-income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force. If they were, they had a few contributions to the AFP system. For you to know this government, many governments even in the past, they hadn't take -- or they took a kind of free ride with the pension system. The total government retirement expenditure in the Pillar O is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for OECD countries is about 18% up to 20%. So here, we have the most important issue about adequacy in this pension system. The Chilean government, they sent very quickly a bill in order to raise their minimum pensions in Pillar 0 up to 10% last week. So they're reacting very quickly. Having said that, the government has to pay a lot of attention about Pillar O and Pillar 0, and that's where the most important initiatives about these whole discussions are going with. The second thing that we have to address in Chile, in this discussion is about the self-employed segment. They're not well covered. They don't have any compulsory contribution. They don't belong to any system and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the AFP system, which are Pillar 1. Still, they start to do 10% contribution rate over salary. I mean, it's absolutely insufficient. Longer for -- I mean, lower for longer is an issue for every place, and Chileans are living longer as well. Also, they do have a salary cap, and their salary cut remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was capped. Today, more than 20% of the labor force is capped. 35% of our customers in Cuprum's are capped. So the 10% over year salary is even lower than 10%. So we have to address the 10%. We're advocating for a 15% minimum and to remove the salary cap. The third issue is to reinforce the Pillar 2, which is the workplace solutions and group solutions in that country. And we have, I would say, good and fairly trained in order to put and -- to put those, I will say, improvements. But I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good, I will say, a pension reform. And I think that it's very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through. I'm absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018."

Around their 27 pensions plan that has been reviewed by Mercer in their annual review, on average, the pension system charge 60 basis point over AUMs. And in the case of Cuprum, we charge a number which is lower than that."

I guess the way I'd go at this is to, again, remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated. And the last piece is our ability to provide lifetime income to retirees. Again, all 3 of those are key components in the strategy. I don't think Chile is any different than the U.S., in the DOL debates that we're having today or some of the same challenges around the rest of the world, whether it was a conversation in Hong Kong. There is an outcry, I would suggest, about making sure that the fees are appropriate. And just like in the case of Chile and Hong Kong and U.S., there's conversation with the DOL and the various regulators around the world to make sure that they understand the products and services that are being provided for by the services companies. And we all know and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the handholding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education and advice, in some instances, is really the lifeblood of this business model around the world. And so as Luis was articulating, we've spent a lot of the time around the world educating regulators that there needs to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products. So to answer your specific question, we're getting some outflows today in Chile, in large part, I believe, because some of the protests that were large 6 weeks ago that continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating. I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we've made in Chile. Hopefully that helps."

But the large real estate sale that we had as well as the encaje performance, we felt that, that was a little bit more transparency, visibility into the volatility that we've seen. In terms of volatility, we -- I've talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity generating anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 EPS. This quarter, we were significantly higher than that, well north of $0.12, $0.13. And so actually, this volatility that we called out brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece. But as I said, you'll have periods where the alternative investments might be a little bit higher or a little bit lower. The general account is actually growing, so you'd see some increase in the net income because of that.

Thanks for the question, Michael. That's probably a 30-minute response, but I'll give a relatively brief response, and what I would say is we have tried to really have a disciplined approach to capital deployment, whether it's to increase our dividends, stock buyback, making investments in our organic growth strategies here at Principal, being very cautious about, even within the organic lines, allocating that capital, where we can -- where we feel the shareholder is benefiting the most. And as you point out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions. I wouldn't call Cuprum a tuck-in, but certainly, across asset management and asset accumulation, we've had some really, really nice acquisitions over the years. And I would say that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and we're going to continue to take a larger ownership share in some of the boutiques that we've acquired in the past. You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area that we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies, where we've got an existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and maybe acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much a part of our strategy. We feel like we've had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we'd have to necessarily acquire another fund's operation. And in terms of asset classes, we've talked about European real estate. We've talked about strategies that really align with what our investors' needs are, which is generating long-term income in retirement and long-dated solutions. Infrastructure is another area where we'd look at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive where, again, we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs.

I'll characterize results for third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2016. I'll share some thoughts on execution highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach and expand our product and service solution set. I'll close with some thoughts on certain external factors and how they're impacting our outlook for the future. 
I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. With reported operating earnings of $336 million, excluding significant variances, we had double-digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter, including the annual actuarial assumption review, later in the call. 
Compared to a year ago, we increased assets under management, or AUM, by some $80 billion or 15%, bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter. As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. As of September 30, 90% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above the median for the 3-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3- and 5-year performance. Though our 3- and 5-year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the 1-year number, with 59% of funds above median, is off its highs. 
Because of investment needs of our customers, we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We've created a leading array of multi-asset, multi-manager, outcomes-oriented solutions, and we purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and noncorrelation for different teams within key asset classes. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to stand out among active managers in both performance and net cash flows. 
With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a seventh consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. 
Our track record of positive net cash flows during the same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model, with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography, and strong integration of our businesses, enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. 
While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. 
As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth. Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures, we have managed expenses and improved margins, driving growth in operating earnings compared to a year ago. 
I'm particularly proud of this result in light of 8% higher average AUM on a year-to-date basis; the additional cost to implement the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule as we've quantified in last quarter's call; and increased investment in key areas, including technology, product development and our global brand. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night, we've increased our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year. 
Moving to execution, I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter, we've launched 5 new funds, bringing year-to-date launches to 9. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging-market middle class, potential regulatory disruption and the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
We remain purposeful on our approach building out 4 key areas: our suite of outcomes-based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower-cost options and provide cost-effective alternatives to passive management. 
Beyond our investment platform, we're also highly focused on digital solutions that are simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action, allow easier decision-making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisors. 
Throughout 2016, I've shared some initial success with recently launched digital enrollment solutions like Easy Elect [ph] and My Virtual Couch. As another example, we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch, we received 2,400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within Specialty Benefits. 
Moving to distribution. We continue to make meaningful progress towards getting our funds on third-party platforms' recommended list and model portfolios. Through 9 months, we've had more than 40 placements in total, putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms, with success across asset classes. 
I also want to comment on the joint venture with China Construction Bank. While not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments, meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature. The result illustrates 2 important points: one, the magnitude of the opportunity in China; and two, the power of our partnership with China Construction Bank, even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third-largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International, with a trailing 12-months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. 
I'll close by sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost, we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly, we're also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain headwinds beginning to abate. 
First, I'll express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016, the tide seems to be turning in the region's largest economy, with the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark equity index, the BOVESPA, strengthening. Our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter. 
On the continued strength of Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil, we generated at least $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly, we're taking market share from the next 2 largest competitors. 
Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, is gaining traction as well, delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. 
Despite recent press, we remain optimistic about Chile. Our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction. To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are, once again, reviewing the merger of 2 legal entities in Chile that gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2015. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice, and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. 
Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior-level officials in Chile. There's increasing awareness of the pressure on pay-as-you-go systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer. In turn, they're increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income in retirement. 
We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and an active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world. Additionally, lower-for-longer interest rates present an opportunity, and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions, including guarantees, to meet the increasing demand for yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate-sensitive than many of our peers. 
Lastly, while the DOL fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter, one of our top third-party distributors communicate a decision to reduce their approved record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. In the meantime, we'll continue to strengthen relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. 
In closing, our business fundamentals remain strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through 9 months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We've again made meaningful progress towards enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening the relationship with customers and advisors. I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?"

This morning, I'll provide commentary on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016, up 6% over the year ago quarter, driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM. Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 billion in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. 
As shown on Slide 6, there were 3 significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements, a single large real estate sale and higher-than-expected encaje returns in Principal International. 
Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other refinements to our actuarial models. 
As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates. The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy but can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $35 million. Third quarter operating earnings also benefited from higher-than-expected encaje performance in Chile and increased reported pretax operating earnings by $8 million. 
Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances in operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. 
Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year ago quarter. Excluding significant variances in both periods, earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17% from the prior year period. 
At the end of the third quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, this measure was approximately 14% in both third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 8, with Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased 57% from the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year ago quarter. This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. 
The fundamentals of the business remain strong as RIS-Fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by quarterly sales of $2.7 billion, a 7% increase in recurring deposits from the prior year quarter and continued strong plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, RIS-Fee's trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread reported third quarter operating earnings of $76 million, up 52% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, RIS-Spread third quarter pretax operating earnings were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. 
Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame, driving growth in net revenue. 
Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales, while pension buyout in investment-only businesses continue to be opportunistic. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. On a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60%, above our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 10. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter, an 18% increase over the year ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global Investors. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion, with more than $4 billion of positive net cash flows in the third quarter.  Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful in allowing us to provide value-added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's pretax return on adjusted revenue was 35% and at the higher end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago quarter, including record operating earnings in Brasilprev. 
Encaje performance was higher-than-expected during third quarter 2016 but was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter 2016 pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year ago quarter. 
Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, excluding significant variances.  This is the first time in the past 5 years we've experienced tailwinds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter. 
As Slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter in Principal International's growth rates. Excluding significant variances and on a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Principal International's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from Southeast Asia. 
While not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Principal International's trailing 12-month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% and within our guided range. 
On Slide 12, Specialty Benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $74 million, up 13% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter, driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, Specialty Benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of in force premium. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting and pricing discipline. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 12% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million. However, excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality, while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15% and was within the guided range. 
Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range.  For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million. Credit-related losses remained well below our pricing assumptions at $7 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. We've deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, bringing the fourth quarter dividend to $0.43 per share. 
We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy, looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility. 
While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. 
As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage to the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth and expenses accordingly as we focus on balancing growth and profitability while still investing in our businesses. As a result, our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months. 
In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments. Third quarter was another strong quarter, adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year and 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

But let me just, first, come at this from the perspective of we have every reason to believe that this tax credit is very much intact. There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015. So again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail. We've been in Chile now since 1995. There's a 21-year history of providing Chileans with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance. We have strong customer service. We're well positioned in Chile to continue to do that. We employed 1,500 individuals down there that can go work every day, trying to strengthen that program. And again, as you noted in my prepared comments, we've had this codified now twice. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, on a very, very stretch, if you will, I'll have Terry comment on the tax implications, if it were to be overturned."

And we ran it through an other after-tax adjustment. Now that would be reflected over a 7- to 10-year period on a quarterly basis, so it wasn't going to have a significant impact in any one particular period. But if we were to have that overturned, we would have to unwind that $105 million. And again, we'd probably run it through another after-tax adjustment as we did in the -- when we recognized the benefit."

In talking about our flows in Chile that you may see now, were Pages 16 in the supplement, it's important to say that if you're paying attention now, our ability to put inflows remains intact in the $1.4 billion level. So the problem that we have had is certainly about outflows during this particular quarter. Two main factors that are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile. It's making the -- more customers have and are anticipating their retirement decisions. So they're taking their money out from the AFPs and mostly they're buying in a compulsory annuity in a asset payout vehicle in life insurance companies. That is one factor that -- which is affecting the industry and is affecting Cuprum as well. The second thing is a further market aggressiveness and the transfer market in the AFPs. Certainly, they're using and abusing about this window opportunity that the headlines and press is providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid. Investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry. So we're taking care of all that, and I'm saying that our people is paying a lot of attention about that. And as I'm saying, we continue to present good inflows and we're paying a lot of attention about these 2 factors. Having said that, it's important to remember, Sean, that in Cuprum, we don't charge fees over AUMs. We charge -- instead, we charge fees over flows on contributions, in monthly contributions.

We look at all the experience adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do. And if you recall, in 2012 and 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down, but probably more importantly, we changed their trajectory in order to get to that longer-term rate. We went from a relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and will be across the yield curve, and it will also reflect not only what the risk-free rate is, but it'll also have an impact on the -- for the spread that we have, the default rate that goes into the assumption, which we don't disclose any of that information. That's for pricing and for proprietary purposes. But to try to give you a little bit of -- maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy, a proxy of the yield curve, we talked about the 10-year treasury and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use. A year ago, when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis point increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now the expectation then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year. But as you're very well aware, the -- instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think, we take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we're hearing from auditors, what we're hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments. We take all these things into consideration, and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time. We have actually moved out in keeping that time period, that 10-year time period, in order to get to our long-term rate consistent, but we're from a different starting point, so you'll look at going out into the future. What we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well. But still, we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. Hopefully that helps."

Now having said that, we're also continuing to make some very significant investments around digital and technology. Certainly, we've talked about the expenses related to the DOL implementation. And we're wanting to make sure we're still planting seeds within all of our businesses so we've got future growth.

If I look at the industry in institutional, the fee pressures depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a sort of rule of thumb, over the last 3 to 4 years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved. When you look at large-scale, large-cap core assets in fixed income and equities, where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure, and in the industry, those maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area, however, of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets, and those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade, and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private, high-yield, other investment grade fixed income and preferreds; all of which are areas we're strong in. And that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant relative to assets compared with most of the industry. So we have some carefully chosen, less liquid categories where active management still pays and where clients benefit from it and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance. But the other piece to this, in terms of where fees are going, is our strength in multi-asset, multi-manager strategies, which are designed to produce an outcome that's desired by clients. Here, I think, target date, target risk, diversified income, diversified real asset. Those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commoditized passive and core areas. So we feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down. But I would say that relative to the industry, we feel very well-placed."

Tremendous scale with regard to services and record keeping in that platform, just tremendous scale. And with the consolidation in the industry, we're going to be a net gainer on that front. Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise -- well, 2 pieces of it. One is what we call Total Retirement Suite. We are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one-stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, your nonqual and you ESOP plan, and that is hugely valuable to our plan sponsors and our advisors with regard to that one-stop shopping. Three, and this is another critical piece, is we have one of the most extensive lineups of target-date funds in the U.S. and they're multi-managed, which is a real benefit in this environment. Multi-managed and hybrid, in other words, the choice not only around sub-advisors but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice, and what we've seen is plan sponsors really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one-stop shopping in addition to that qualified default option."

Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it",616,"Yes. Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it might sounds to you a little bit counterintuitive, but I have to say also that Principal, since the early 2000, we're been a strong advocator in order to review the pension reform in Chile in a much more comprehensive way, as I said. The pension system, as you know, is the golden standard in sustainability, but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy. And the most important problem is the one that's created the -- this kind of social unrest that you have seen. It's Pillar 0 that has nothing to do with the AFPs. It's the pillar that's being called the Solidarity Pillar and in which the government is in charge of. That pillar is very much more the one that's provided a safety net for low-income segment in Chile. And most of this low-income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force. If they were, they had a few contributions to the AFP system. For you to know this government, many governments even in the past, they hadn't take -- or they took a kind of free ride with the pension system. The total government retirement expenditure in the Pillar O is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for OECD countries is about 18% up to 20%. So here, we have the most important issue about adequacy in this pension system. The Chilean government, they sent very quickly a bill in order to raise their minimum pensions in Pillar 0 up to 10% last week. So they're reacting very quickly. Having said that, the government has to pay a lot of attention about Pillar O and Pillar 0, and that's where the most important initiatives about these whole discussions are going with. The second thing that we have to address in Chile, in this discussion is about the self-employed segment. They're not well covered. They don't have any compulsory contribution. They don't belong to any system and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the AFP system, which are Pillar 1. Still, they start to do 10% contribution rate over salary. I mean, it's absolutely insufficient. Longer for -- I mean, lower for longer is an issue for every place, and Chileans are living longer as well. Also, they do have a salary cap, and their salary cap remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was capped. Today, more than 20% of the labor force is capped. 35% of our customers in Cuprum are capped. So the 10% over year salary is even lower than 10%. So we have to address the 10%. We're advocating for a 15% minimum and to remove the salary cap. The third issue is to reinforce the Pillar 2, which is the workplace solutions and group solutions in that country. And we have, I would say, good and fairly trained in order to put and -- to put those, I will say, improvements. But I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good, I will say, a pension reform. And I think that it's very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through. I'm absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018."

I guess the way I'd go at this is to, again, remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated. And the last piece is our ability to provide lifetime income to retirees. Again, all 3 of those are key components in the strategy. I don't think Chile is any different than the U.S., in the DOL debates that we're having today or some of the same challenges around the rest of the world, whether it was a conversation in Hong Kong. There is an outcry, I would suggest, about making sure that the fees are appropriate. And just like in the case of Chile and Hong Kong and U.S., there's conversation with the DOL and the various regulators around the world to make sure that they understand the products and services that are being provided for by the services companies. And we all know and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the handholding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education and advice, in some instances, is really the lifeblood of this business model around the world. And so as Luis was articulating, we've spent a lot of the time around the world educating regulators that there needs to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products. So to answer your specific question, we're getting some outflows today in Chile, in large part, I believe, because some of the protests that were large 6 weeks ago that continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating. I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we've made in Chile. Hopefully that helps."

In terms of volatility, we -- I've talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity generating anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 EPS. This quarter, we were significantly higher than that, well north of $0.12, $0.13. And so actually, this volatility that we called out brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece.

You're seeing growth across basically every metric, whether that's plan count, whether that's total recurring deposits. We're just seeing very strong, very broad growth in this business. So the underlying growth is exceptionally strong. What we're just -- what we're speaking to is that run rate and just want to make sure people understand that we've got 2 issues here.

I'm very pleased to say that the way things are turning out are fairly consistent with what we have been articulating, and that is that our large distribution partners, who we have been out to see and worked very closely with, most of them have come in on what their strategy is, in allowing their financial advisors to work under 2 different environments: one on a fee basis, one on the basis of the best interest contract standard. And we're seeing a full range and a lot of discussion around that. And again, we were anticipating that, and we would expect it. Secondly, we don't see any sort of change as reflects our ability to continue to have a robust investment platform with proprietary investment options being made available to small- to medium-sized employers, certainly requires all the appropriate disclosure. And third, a benefit event for job changers and retirees, again, requires disclosure, but again, a workable model for the sake of being able to continue to provide our customers with choices at retirement, whether they decide to keep the money in the plan, choose a rollover IRA with Principal or to take their funds to a different services provider. And then lastly, as we've worked through our own broker-dealer and looking closely at our financial advisors, our 1,500-or-so financial advisors, we're retaining our talent. They have found what we have shared with them as a workable solution to allow them to continue to have a successful practice here at Principal.

Thanks for the question, Michael. That's probably a 30-minute response, but I'll give a relatively brief response, and what I would say is we have tried to really have a disciplined approach to capital deployment, whether it's to increase our dividends, stock buyback, making investments in our organic growth strategies here at Principal, being very cautious about, even within the organic lines, allocating that capital, where we can -- where we feel the shareholder is benefiting the most. And as you point out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions. I wouldn't call Cuprum a tuck-in, but certainly, across asset management and asset accumulation, we've had some really, really nice acquisitions over the years. And I would say that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and we're going to continue to take a larger ownership share in some of the boutiques that we've acquired in the past. You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area that we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies, where we've got an existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and maybe acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much a part of our strategy. We feel like we've had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we'd have to necessarily acquire another fund's operation. And in terms of asset classes, we've talked about European real estate. We've talked about strategies that really align with what our investors' needs are, which is generating long-term income in retirement and long-dated solutions. Infrastructure is another area where we've looked at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive where, again, we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs.

As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com/investor.

I'll characterize results for third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2016. I'll share some thoughts on execution highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach and expand our product and service solution set. I'll close with some thoughts on certain external factors and how they're impacting our outlook for the future. 
I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. With reported operating earnings of $336 million, excluding significant variances, we had double-digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter, including the annual actuarial assumption review, later in the call. 
Compared to a year ago, we increased assets under management, or AUM, by some $80 billion or 15%, bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter. As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. As of September 30, 90% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above the median for the 3-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3- and 5-year performance. Though our 3- and 5-year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the 1-year number, with 59% of funds above median, is off its highs. 
Because of investment needs of our customers, we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We've created a leading array of multi-asset, multi-manager, outcomes-oriented solutions, and we purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and noncorrelation for different teams within key asset classes. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to stand out among active managers in both performance and net cash flows. 
With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a seventh consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. 
Our track record of positive net cash flows during the same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model, with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography, and strong integration of our businesses, enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. 
While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. 
As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth. Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures, we have managed expenses and improved margins, driving growth in operating earnings compared to a year ago. 
I'm particularly proud of this result in light of 8% higher average AUM on a year-to-date basis; the additional cost to implement the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule as we've quantified in last quarter's call; and increased investment in key areas, including technology, product development and our global brand. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night, we've increased our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year. 
Moving to execution, I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter, we've launched 5 new funds, bringing year-to-date launches to 9. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging-market middle class, potential regulatory disruption and the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
We remain purposeful on our approach building out 4 key areas: our suite of outcomes-based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower-cost options and provide cost-effective alternatives to passive management. 
Beyond our investment platform, we're also highly focused on digital solutions that are simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action, allow easier decision-making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisors. 
Throughout 2016, I've shared some initial success with recently launched digital enrollment solutions like Easy Elect [ph] and My Virtual Couch. As another example, we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch, we received 2,400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within Specialty Benefits. 
Moving to distribution. We continue to make meaningful progress towards getting our funds on third-party platforms' recommended list and model portfolios. Through 9 months, we've had more than 40 placements in total, putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms, with success across asset classes. 
I also want to comment on the joint venture with China Construction Bank. While not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments, meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature. The result illustrates 2 important points: one, the magnitude of the opportunity in China; and two, the power of our partnership with China Construction Bank, even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third-largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International, with a trailing 12-months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. 
I'll close by sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost, we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly, we're also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain headwinds beginning to abate. 
First, I'll express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016, the tide seems to be turning in the region's largest economy, with the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark equity index, the BOVESPA, strengthening. Our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter. 
On the continued strength of Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil, we generated at least $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly, we're taking market share from the next 2 largest competitors. 
Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, is gaining traction as well, delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. 
Despite recent press, we remain optimistic about Chile. Our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction. To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are, once again, reviewing the merger of 2 legal entities in Chile that gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2015. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice, and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. 
Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior-level officials in Chile. There's increasing awareness of the pressure on pay-as-you-go systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer. In turn, they're increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income in retirement. 
We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and an active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world. Additionally, lower-for-longer interest rates present an opportunity, and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions, including guarantees, to meet the increasing demand for yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate-sensitive than many of our peers. 
Lastly, while the DOL fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter, one of our top third-party distributors communicate a decision to reduce their approved record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. In the meantime, we'll continue to strengthen relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. 
In closing, our business fundamentals remain strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through 9 months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We've again made meaningful progress towards enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening the relationship with customers and advisors. I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?"

This morning, I'll provide commentary on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016, up 6% over the year ago quarter, driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM. Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 billion in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. 
As shown on Slide 6, there were 3 significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements, a single large real estate sale and higher-than-expected encaje returns in Principal International. 
Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other refinements to our actuarial models. 
As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates. The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy but can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $35 million. Third quarter operating earnings also benefited from higher-than-expected encaje performance in Chile and increased reported pretax operating earnings by $8 million. 
Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances in operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. 
Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year ago quarter. Excluding significant variances in both periods, earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17% from the prior year period. 
At the end of the third quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, this measure was approximately 14% in both third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 8, with Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased 57% from the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year ago quarter. This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. 
The fundamentals of the business remain strong as RIS-Fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by quarterly sales of $2.7 billion, a 7% increase in recurring deposits from the prior year quarter and continued strong plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, RIS-Fee's trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread reported third quarter operating earnings of $76 million, up 52% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, RIS-Spread third quarter pretax operating earnings were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. 
Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame, driving growth in net revenue. 
Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales, while pension buyout in investment-only businesses continue to be opportunistic. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. On a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60%, above our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 10. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter, an 18% increase over the year ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global Investors. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion, with more than $4 billion of positive net cash flows in the third quarter.  Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful in allowing us to provide value-added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's pretax return on adjusted revenue was 35% and at the higher end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago quarter, including record operating earnings in Brasilprev. 
Encaje performance was higher-than-expected during third quarter 2016 but was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter 2016 pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year ago quarter. 
Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, excluding significant variances.  This is the first time in the past 5 years we've experienced tailwinds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter. 
As Slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter in Principal International's growth rates. Excluding significant variances and on a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Principal International's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from Southeast Asia. 
While not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Principal International's trailing 12-month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% and within our guided range. 
On Slide 12, Specialty Benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $74 million, up 13% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter, driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, Specialty Benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of in force premium. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting and pricing discipline. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 12% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million. However, excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality, while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15% and was within the guided range. 
Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range.  For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million. Credit-related losses remained well below our pricing assumptions at $7 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. We've deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, bringing the fourth quarter dividend to $0.43 per share. 
We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy, looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility. 
While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. 
As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage to the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth and expenses accordingly as we focus on balancing growth and profitability while still investing in our businesses. As a result, our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months. 
In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments. Third quarter was another strong quarter, adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year and 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

But let me just, first, come at this from the perspective of we have every reason to believe that this tax credit is very much intact. There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015. So again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail. We've been in Chile now since 1995. There's a 21-year history of providing Chileans with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance. We have strong customer service. We're well positioned in Chile to continue to do that. We employed 1,500 individuals down there that can go work every day, trying to strengthen that program. And again, as you noted in my prepared comments, we've had this codified now twice. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, on a very, very stretch, if you will, I'll have Terry comment on the tax implications, if it were to be overturned."

And we ran it through an other after-tax adjustment. Now that would be reflected over a 7- to 10-year period on a quarterly basis, so it wasn't going to have a significant impact in any one particular period. But if we were to have that overturned, we would have to unwind that $105 million. And again, we'd probably run it through another after-tax adjustment as we did in the -- when we recognized the benefit."

In talking about our flows in Chile that you may see now, were Pages 16 in the supplement, it's important to say that if you're paying attention now, our ability to put inflows remains intact in the $1.4 billion level. So the problem that we have had is certainly about outflows during this particular quarter. Two main factors that are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile. It's making the -- more customers have and are anticipating their retirement decisions. So they're taking their money out from the AFPs and mostly they're buying in a compulsory annuity in a asset payout vehicle in life insurance companies. That is one factor that -- which is affecting the industry and is affecting Cuprum as well. The second thing is a further market aggressiveness and the transfer market in the AFPs. Certainly, they're using and abusing about this window opportunity that the headlines and press is providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid. Investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry. So we're taking care of all that, and I'm saying that our people is paying a lot of attention about that. And as I'm saying, we continue to present good inflows and we're paying a lot of attention about these 2 factors. Having said that, it's important to remember, Sean, that in Cuprum, we don't charge fees over AUMs. We charge -- instead, we charge fees over flows on contributions, in monthly contributions. So this effect particularly -- specifically like what happened the last quarter, has a very marginal impact in our financials."

We look at all the experience adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do. And if you recall, in 2012 and 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down, but probably more importantly, we changed their trajectory in order to get to that longer-term rate. We went from a relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and will be across the yield curve, and it will also reflect not only what the risk-free rate is, but it'll also have an impact on the -- for the spread that we have, the default rate that goes into the assumption, which we don't disclose any of that information. That's for pricing and for proprietary purposes. But to try to give you a little bit of -- maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy, a proxy of the yield curve, we talked about the 10-year treasury and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use. A year ago, when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis point increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now the expectation then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year. But as you're very well aware, the -- instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think, we take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we're hearing from auditors, what we're hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments. We take all these things into consideration, and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time. We have actually moved out in keeping that time period, that 10-year time period, in order to get to our long-term rate consistent, but we're from a different starting point, so you'll look at going out into the future. What we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well. But still, we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. Hopefully that helps."

And we're wanting to make sure we're still planting seeds within all of our businesses so we've got future growth. So I don't want anybody to walk away from the call or the quarter to think that somehow it's taking out all expenses at all cost because that's just not -- it's not the approach that we would take here at Principal. So with that as a backdrop as it relates specifically to fee, growth and revenue growth along the lines of business, I'll have Jim go first and then have Nora make some additional comments. Jim?"

If I look at the industry in institutional, the fee pressures depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a sort of rule of thumb, over the last 3 to 4 years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved. When you look at large-scale, large-cap core assets in fixed income and equities, where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure, and in the industry, those maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area, however, of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets, and those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade, and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private, high-yield, other investment grade fixed income and preferreds; all of which are areas we're strong in. And that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant relative to assets compared with most of the industry. So we have some carefully chosen, less liquid categories where active management still pays and where clients benefit from it and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance. But the other piece to this, in terms of where fees are going, is our strength in multi-asset, multi-manager strategies, which are designed to produce an outcome that's desired by clients. Here, I think, target date, target risk, diversified income, diversified real asset. Those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commoditized passive and core areas. So we feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down. But I would say that relative to the industry, we feel very well-placed."

Tremendous scale with regard to services and record keeping in that platform, just tremendous scale. And with the consolidation in the industry, we're going to be a net gainer on that front. Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise -- well, 2 pieces of it. One is what we call Total Retirement Suite. We are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one-stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, your nonqual and you ESOP plan, and that is hugely valuable to our plan sponsors and our advisors with regard to that one-stop shopping. Three, and this is another critical piece, is we have one of the most extensive lineups of target-date funds in the U.S. and they're multi-managed, which is a real benefit in this environment. Multi-managed and hybrid, in other words, the choice not only around sub-advisors but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice, and what we've seen is plan sponsors really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one-stop shopping in addition to that qualified default option."

Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it",616,"Yes. Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it might sounds to you a little bit counterintuitive, but I have to say also that Principal, since the early 2000, we're been a strong advocator in order to review the pension reform in Chile in a much more comprehensive way, as I said. The pension system, as you know, is the golden standard in sustainability, but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy. And the most important problem is the one that's created the -- this kind of social unrest that you have seen. It's Pillar 0 that has nothing to do with the AFPs. It's the pillar that's being called the Solidarity Pillar and in which the government is in charge of. That pillar is very much more the one that's provided a safety net for low-income segment in Chile. And most of this low-income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force. If they were, they had a few contributions to the AFP system. For you to know this government, many governments even in the past, they hadn't take -- or they took a kind of free ride with the pension system. The total government retirement expenditure in the Pillar O is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for OECD countries is about 18% up to 20%. So here, we have the most important issue about adequacy in this pension system. The Chilean government, they sent very quickly a bill in order to raise their minimum pensions in Pillar 0 up to 10% last week. So they're reacting very quickly. Having said that, the government has to pay a lot of attention about Pillar O and Pillar 0, and that's where the most important initiatives about these whole discussions are going with. The second thing that we have to address in Chile, in this discussion is about the self-employed segment. They're not well covered. They don't have any compulsory contribution. They don't belong to any system and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the AFP system, which are Pillar 1. Still, they start to do 10% contribution rate over salary. I mean, it's absolutely insufficient. Longer for -- I mean, lower for longer is an issue for every place, and Chileans are living longer as well. Also, they do have a salary cap, and their salary cap remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was capped. Today, more than 20% of the labor force is capped. 35% of our customers in Cuprum are capped. So the 10% over year salary is even lower than 10%. So we have to address the 10%. We're advocating for a 15% minimum and to remove the salary cap. The third issue is to reinforce the Pillar 2, which is the workplace solutions and group solutions in that country. And we have, I would say, good and fairly trained in order to put and -- to put those, I will say, improvements. But I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good, I will say, a pension reform. And I think that it's very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through. I'm absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018."

Around their 27 pensions plan that has been reviewed by Mercer in their annual review, on average, the pension system charge 60 basis point over AUMs. And in the case of Cuprum, we charge a number which is lower than that."

I guess the way I'd go at this is to, again, remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated. And the last piece is our ability to provide lifetime income to retirees. Again, all 3 of those are key components in the strategy. I don't think Chile is any different than the U.S., in the DOL debates that we're having today or some of the same challenges around the rest of the world, whether it was a conversation in Hong Kong. There is an outcry, I would suggest, about making sure that the fees are appropriate. And just like in the case of Chile and Hong Kong and U.S., there's conversation with the DOL and the various regulators around the world to make sure that they understand the products and services that are being provided for by the services companies. And we all know and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the handholding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education and advice, in some instances, is really the lifeblood of this business model around the world. And so as Luis was articulating, we've spent a lot of the time around the world educating regulators that there needs to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products. So to answer your specific question, we're getting some outflows today in Chile, in large part, I believe, because some of the protests that were large 6 weeks ago that continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating. I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we've made in Chile. Hopefully that helps."

That had, obviously, a volatile number this quarter. But the large real estate sale that we had as well as the encaje performance, we felt that, that was a little bit more transparency, visibility into the volatility that we've seen. In terms of volatility, we -- I've talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity generating anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 EPS. This quarter, we were significantly higher than that, well north of $0.12, $0.13. And so actually, this volatility that we called out brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece. But as I said, you'll have periods where the alternative investments might be a little bit higher or a little bit lower. The general account is actually growing, so you'd see some increase in the net income because of that. But we try to give you the best information possible in terms of the variance or volatility from what we would have expected.

Thanks for the question, Michael. That's probably a 30-minute response, but I'll give a relatively brief response, and what I would say is we have tried to really have a disciplined approach to capital deployment, whether it's to increase our dividends, stock buyback, making investments in our organic growth strategies here at Principal, being very cautious about, even within the organic lines, allocating that capital, where we can -- where we feel the shareholder is benefiting the most. And as you point out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions. I wouldn't call Cuprum a tuck-in, but certainly, across asset management and asset accumulation, we've had some really, really nice acquisitions over the years. And I would say that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and we're going to continue to take a larger ownership share in some of the boutiques that we've acquired in the past. You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area that we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies, where we've got an existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and maybe acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much a part of our strategy. We feel like we've had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we'd have to necessarily acquire another fund's operation. And in terms of asset classes, we've talked about European real estate. We've talked about strategies that really align with what our investors' needs are, which is generating long-term income in retirement and long-dated solutions. Infrastructure is another area where we've looked at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive where, again, we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs. Is that helpful?"

As always, our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com/investor. Due to the annual actuarial assumption review and other significant variances at this quarter, we posted some additional materials on the website, including comparison of quarterly operating earnings, excluding significant variances from the third quarter 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. Keep in mind, our reporting structure changed in the fourth quarter 2015.

I'll characterize results for third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2016. I'll share some thoughts on execution highlights as we continue to extend our distribution reach and expand our product and service solution set. I'll close with some thoughts on certain external factors and how they're impacting our outlook for the future. 
I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. With reported operating earnings of $336 million, excluding significant variances, we had double-digit growth in operating earnings when compared to a year ago quarter. Terry will provide more details on the significant variances for the quarter, including the annual actuarial assumption review, later in the call. 
Compared to a year ago, we increased assets under management, or AUM, by some $80 billion or 15%, bringing AUM to record $596 billion as of the end of the third quarter. As shown on Slide 5, our longer-term Morningstar investment performance remains among the best in the industry. As of September 30, 90% of Principal mutual funds, separate accounts and collective investment trusts were above the median for the 3-year performance and 86% were above the median for the 5-year performance. For 10 consecutive quarters, at least 85% of our investment options have been above median for 3- and 5-year performance. Though our 3- and 5-year investment performance remains among the best in the industry, the 1-year number, with 59% of funds above median, is off its highs. 
Because of investment needs of our customers, we focus on managing assets for retirement and other long-term strategies. We've created a leading array of multi-asset, multi-manager, outcomes-oriented solutions, and we purposely designed our investment platform to provide diversification and noncorrelation for different teams within key asset classes. Between the strength of our investment teams, our global research platform and our process, we remain confident in our ability to continue to stand out among active managers in both performance and net cash flows. 
With multiple sources of demand for our investment solutions, we're on track for a seventh consecutive year of positive net cash flows. By comparison, approximately half of the funds complexes were in outflows between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. 
Our track record of positive net cash flows during the same time frame underscores the benefit of our diversified integrated business model, with strong diversification by investor type, asset class and geography, and strong integration of our businesses, enabling us to meet investor needs as they transition from accumulation into retirement. 
While Terry will cover these topics in more detail, I'll provide a couple of comments on expense management and capital deployment. 
As stated on previous calls, we continue to focus on aligning revenue and expense growth. Over the trailing 12 months, despite flat equity markets, a strong U.S. dollar and competitive pressures, we have managed expenses and improved margins, driving growth in operating earnings compared to a year ago. 
I'm particularly proud of this result in light of 8% higher average AUM on a year-to-date basis; the additional cost to implement the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule as we've quantified in last quarter's call; and increased investment in key areas, including technology, product development and our global brand. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, our capital deployment strategy has enabled us to deploy more than $600 million between common stock dividends, share repurchases and increased ownership in boutiques. As announced last night, we've increased our quarterly common stock dividend for a third time this year. 
Moving to execution, I'll start with enhancements to our solution set. In the third quarter, we've launched 5 new funds, bringing year-to-date launches to 9. Our global product strategy contemplates both opportunities and challenges, including aging global populations and growth in emerging-market middle class, potential regulatory disruption and the trend towards lower-cost product structures. 
We remain purposeful on our approach building out 4 key areas: our suite of outcomes-based funds with a particular focus on income solutions; our alternative investment platform to enhance diversification and manage downside risk; our international retail platform in light of tremendous opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Europe; and our ETF platform as part of a larger effort to address increased demand for lower-cost options and provide cost-effective alternatives to passive management. 
Beyond our investment platform, we're also highly focused on digital solutions that are simpler and faster, address how future generations will buy financial services and reduce barriers to action, allow easier decision-making and eliminate pain points for our customers and advisors. 
Throughout 2016, I've shared some initial success with recently launched digital enrollment solutions like Easy Elect [ph] and My Virtual Couch. As another example, we launched an online application for our individual disability income products earlier this year. Since the launch, we received 2,400 applications electronically, nearly 20% of the total volume. This is helping fuel strong sales within Specialty Benefits. 
Moving to distribution. We continue to make meaningful progress towards getting our funds on third-party platforms' recommended list and model portfolios. Through 9 months, we've had more than 40 placements in total, putting 30 different funds on 18 different investment platforms, with success across asset classes. 
I also want to comment on the joint venture with China Construction Bank. While not included in our reported AUM, China reported a record $127 billion of AUM in the third quarter 2016. A majority of the recent net cash flows in China have been short-term investments, meaning lower fees and shorter duration in nature. The result illustrates 2 important points: one, the magnitude of the opportunity in China; and two, the power of our partnership with China Construction Bank, even more so as we expand our relationship and execute on our strategic cooperation agreement focused on asset management and pensions. China is now the third-largest contributor to the pretax operating earnings within Principal International, with a trailing 12-months pretax operating earnings more than doubling from a year ago quarter. 
I'll close by sharing some thoughts on the future. First and foremost, we go forward from a position of strength. Importantly, we're also seeing certain opportunities further materialize and certain headwinds beginning to abate. 
First, I'll express my optimism around Latin America. In 2016, the tide seems to be turning in the region's largest economy, with the Brazilian real and the Brazilian's benchmark equity index, the BOVESPA, strengthening. Our third quarter net cash flows in Brazil increased 50% compared to a year ago quarter. 
On the continued strength of Brasilprev, our joint venture with Banco do Brasil, we generated at least $1 billion of positive flows in Brazil for 12 consecutive quarters. Importantly, we're taking market share from the next 2 largest competitors. 
Claritas, our mutual fund company in Brazil, is gaining traction as well, delivering its best quarter of net cash flows on record. 
Despite recent press, we remain optimistic about Chile. Our value proposition in the AFP market is intact as we continue to be a market leader in long-term investment performance and customer satisfaction. To be clear, our 2013 Cuprum acquisition is not under review by the Chilean regulatory authorities. They are, once again, reviewing the merger of 2 legal entities in Chile that gave rise to the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2015. The merger has already been reviewed and approved twice, and we have no reason to believe it will be overturned. 
Over recent weeks, Luis and I have had multiple opportunities to meet with senior-level officials in Chile. There's increasing awareness of the pressure on pay-as-you-go systems and the ability of workers to support a growing number of retirees who are living longer. In turn, they're increasing awareness of importance of voluntary contributions to achieve adequate income in retirement. 
We'll continue to be an advocate for retirement readiness and an active participant in the pension dialogue, not only in Chile but around the world. Additionally, lower-for-longer interest rates present an opportunity, and we continue to expand our suite of income solutions, including guarantees, to meet the increasing demand for yield and security. Additionally, our business mix makes us less rate-sensitive than many of our peers. 
Lastly, while the DOL fiduciary rule clearly presents challenges, it also presents opportunities. During the third quarter, one of our top third-party distributors communicate a decision to reduce their approved record keeper list by more than 80%. Principal was selected as one of their approved providers. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. In the meantime, we'll continue to strengthen relationships by helping our distributors work through implementation. 
In closing, our business fundamentals remain strong. While I'm pleased with our financial results through 9 months, I'm even more satisfied with our execution. We've again made meaningful progress towards enhancing distribution, expanding our solution set and strengthening the relationship with customers and advisors. I look for us to continue to build momentum as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017 and for that momentum to translate into long-term value for our shareholders. Terry?"

This morning, I'll provide commentary on operating earnings for the quarter; net income, including performance of the investment portfolio; and I'll close with an update on capital deployment. 
Principal reported $336 million of operating earnings for third quarter 2016, up 6% over the year ago quarter, driven by over 10% growth in quarterly average AUM. Total company net cash flows were $7 billion for third quarter and $20 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong net cash flows and positive market performance drove total company AUM to a record $596 billion in third quarter. Keep in mind that total company AUM excludes $127 billion of AUM in China that also contributed to quarterly earnings. 
As shown on Slide 6, there were 3 significant variances from expectations reflected in third quarter 2016 operating earnings. This slide provides the line item impact by business unit of our annual actuarial assumption review and model enhancements, a single large real estate sale and higher-than-expected encaje returns in Principal International. 
Consistent with prior years, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumption and model enhancements in the third quarter. The review reflected a lower interest rate environment in 2016 compared to what we expected a year ago and other refinements to our actuarial models. 
As part of the review, no changes were made to the long-term interest rates or the time it takes to get to the ultimate rates. The actuarial assumption review decreased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $74 million. However, third quarter operating earnings benefited from a real estate sale that generated higher-than-expected variable investment income. As a reminder, real estate sales are part of our overall investment strategy but can add volatility to any given quarter. This significant variance increased third quarter reported pretax operating earnings by $35 million. Third quarter operating earnings also benefited from higher-than-expected encaje performance in Chile and increased reported pretax operating earnings by $8 million. 
Slide 7 provides a comparison of the significant variances in operating earnings in third quarter 2016 versus the year ago quarter. Both quarters were impacted by actuarial assumption review and other significant variances. 
Third quarter 2016 reported earnings per share of $1.15 was up 8% over the year ago quarter. Excluding significant variances in both periods, earnings per share of $1.22 was up 17% from the prior year period. 
At the end of the third quarter, trailing 12-month return on equity, excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments, was 13.5%. However, excluding the impact of both 2015 and 2016 actuarial assumption reviews, this measure was approximately 14% in both third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015. 
Now I'll discuss the business unit results, starting on Slide 8, with Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS-Fee. Third quarter reported operating earnings of $131 million increased 57% from the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter pretax operating earnings were $145 million, a 6% increase from the year ago quarter. This was driven by a combination of growth in business and disciplined expense management. 
The fundamentals of the business remain strong as RIS-Fee net cash flows were a positive $1.4 billion in the third quarter. The positive net cash flows were driven by quarterly sales of $2.7 billion, a 7% increase in recurring deposits from the prior year quarter and continued strong plan retention levels. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, RIS-Fee's trailing 12-month pretax return on net revenue was 34% in third quarter 2016. We expect to end the year at the high end of our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 9. RIS-Spread reported third quarter operating earnings of $76 million, up 52% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, RIS-Spread third quarter pretax operating earnings were $66 million, a $14 million increase over the prior year quarter. 
Average account values grew 13% over the same time frame, driving growth in net revenue. 
Continued low interest rates negatively impacted retail annuity sales, while pension buyout in investment-only businesses continue to be opportunistic. We continue to maintain our pricing discipline when deploying capital in this space. On a trailing 12-month basis and excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, third quarter pretax return on net revenue was 60%, above our guided range. 
Turning to Slide 10. Principal Global Investors reported pretax operating earnings of $113 million in the third quarter, an 18% increase over the year ago quarter on 12% growth in AUM. This demonstrates the continued benefit of scale in Principal Global Investors. 
Both the retail and the institutional platforms contributed to a record AUM of $397 billion, with more than $4 billion of positive net cash flows in the third quarter.  Our unique boutique strategy is proving successful in allowing us to provide value-added solutions that continue to resonate with clients. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, PGI's pretax return on adjusted revenue was 35% and at the higher end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 11, reported third quarter pretax operating earnings for Principal International were $84 million, up 65% from the year ago quarter, including record operating earnings in Brasilprev. 
Encaje performance was higher-than-expected during third quarter 2016 but was more than offset by the impact of the actuarial assumption review. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, third quarter 2016 pretax operating earnings increased 25% over the year ago quarter. 
Foreign currency translation was a $1 million benefit to pretax operating earnings for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, excluding significant variances.  This is the first time in the past 5 years we've experienced tailwinds from currency translations in earnings when compared to the prior year quarter. 
As Slide 11 shows, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter in Principal International's growth rates. Excluding significant variances and on a constant-currency basis, Principal International continues to produce mid-teens growth in pretax operating earnings on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Principal International's net cash flows for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, primarily driven by $1.8 billion from Brazil and a very strong $1.1 billion from Southeast Asia. 
While not included in Principal International's reported net cash flows, China reported third quarter net cash flows of nearly $27 billion, another very strong quarter that contributed to China's 51% growth in pretax operating earnings from a year ago. 
Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Principal International's trailing 12-month combined pretax return on net revenue was 38% and within our guided range. 
On Slide 12, Specialty Benefits reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were $74 million, up 13% over the year ago quarter. Excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, pretax operating earnings were $56 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter, driven by underlying growth in the business. Additionally, Specialty Benefits hit a milestone during the third quarter and crossed $2 billion of in force premium. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, our loss ratio of 64% reflects continued strong underwriting and pricing discipline. Pretax return on premium and fees in Specialty Benefits was 12% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This was at the top end of our guided range. 
As shown on Slide 13, Individual Life reported third quarter pretax operating earnings were a negative $4 million. However, excluding the significant variances shown on Slide 7, Individual Life pretax operating earnings were $40 million, 8% lower than the prior year period. While mortality for both quarters was within the expected range, third quarter 2015 experienced favorable mortality, while third quarter 2016 mortality was in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review, the trailing 12-month pretax return on premium and fees was 15% and was within the guided range. 
Corporate's third quarter pretax operating losses were $58 million, in line with our guided range.  For the quarter, total company net income was $308 million. Credit-related losses remained well below our pricing assumptions at $7 million. 
Turning to Slide 14. We've deployed and committed nearly $730 million of capital so far in 2016. In third quarter 2016, we paid a $0.41 per share common stock dividend. Last night, we announced another $0.02 increase in our common stock dividend, bringing the fourth quarter dividend to $0.43 per share. 
We take a long-term view of our balanced capital deployment strategy, looking for ways to increase long-term shareholder value and improving our financial flexibility. 
While capital deployment may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we expect to be within our $800 million to $1 billion guided range for full year 2016. 
As we near the end of our prepared remarks, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We continue to manage to the competitive pressures and volatile macroeconomic environments to forecast growth in revenue. We have aligned growth and expenses accordingly as we focus on balancing growth and profitability while still investing in our businesses. As a result, our efforts to manage expense growth have contributed to operating earnings growth and margin expansions over the trailing 12 months. 
In conclusion, I'll echo Dan's earlier comments. Third quarter was another strong quarter, adding to a very strong 2016 thus far. I'm very excited as I look ahead and see great momentum going into the end of the year and 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

So thanks, Sean, for the question, and I'll have Terry hit the tax piece and Luis make some additional comments. But let me just, first, come at this from the perspective of we have every reason to believe that this tax credit is very much intact. There are actually 48 other companies that took the exact same tax credit back in 2015. So again, we feel very, very confident we'll prevail. We've been in Chile now since 1995. There's a 21-year history of providing Chileans with retirement solutions on the voluntary, certainly on the payout and now the mandatory program. We have great performance. We have strong customer service. We're well positioned in Chile to continue to do that. We employed 1,500 individuals down there that can go work every day, trying to strengthen that program. And again, as you noted in my prepared comments, we've had this codified now twice. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, on a very, very stretch, if you will, I'll have Terry comment on the tax implications, if it were to be overturned."

Just to put it in context here, in 2015, we recognized the benefit of the merger with the AFP with one of our subsidiaries in Chile. As a result of that merger, we were allowed to amortize or reflect the amortization of the intangible in our tax calculation. That amount was $105 million at that point in time. And we ran it through an other after-tax adjustment. Now that would be reflected over a 7- to 10-year period on a quarterly basis, so it wasn't going to have a significant impact in any one particular period. But if we were to have that overturned, we would have to unwind that $105 million. And again, we'd probably run it through another after-tax adjustment as we did in the -- when we recognized the benefit."

In talking about our flows in Chile that you may see now, were Pages 16 in the supplement, it's important to say that if you're paying attention now, our ability to put inflows remains intact in the $1.4 billion level. So the problem that we have had is certainly about outflows during this particular quarter. Two main factors that are affecting our outflows. One is affecting the whole industry. There's a new discussion about a potential pension reform in Chile. It's making the -- more customers have and are anticipating their retirement decisions. So they're taking their money out from the AFPs and mostly they're buying in a compulsory annuity in a asset payout vehicle in life insurance companies. That is one factor that -- which is affecting the industry and is affecting Cuprum as well. The second thing is a further market aggressiveness and the transfer market in the AFPs. Certainly, they're using and abusing about this window opportunity that the headlines and press is providing to them about our merger. We are working and paying a lot of attention about asset retention and client retentions because all our fundamentals remain very solid. Investment performance and client service remains among the best in the industry. So we're taking care of all that, and I'm saying that our people is paying a lot of attention about that. And as I'm saying, we continue to present good inflows and we're paying a lot of attention about these 2 factors. Having said that, it's important to remember, Sean, that in Cuprum, we don't charge fees over AUMs. We charge -- instead, we charge fees over flows on contributions, in monthly contributions. So this effect particularly -- specifically like what happened the last quarter, has a very marginal impact in our financials."

We look at all the experience adjustments in our annual actuarial review that we do. And if you recall, in 2012 and 2015, we took a look at our long-term interest rate assumption and we brought those long-term ultimate rates down, but probably more importantly, we changed their trajectory in order to get to that longer-term rate. We went from a relatively short period of time to over 10 years in order to get to it. Now you're very well aware that the long-term interest rate assumption really varies by product that we have and will be across the yield curve, and it will also reflect not only what the risk-free rate is, but it'll also have an impact on the -- for the spread that we have, the default rate that goes into the assumption, which we don't disclose any of that information. That's for pricing and for proprietary purposes. But to try to give you a little bit of -- maybe a little bit more insight in terms of using as a proxy, a proxy of the yield curve, we talked about the 10-year treasury and that seems to be a pretty good proxy to use. A year ago, when the 10-year treasury was about 2%, we talked about basically a 25 basis point increase to that rate over a 10-year period. Now the expectation then was that we would be up by 25 basis points this year. But as you're very well aware, the -- instead of going up by 25 basis points, it went down by 50 basis points or so, the 10-year treasury. However, as we look in terms of our forecast into the future, which everybody will have a forecast as to what they think, we take into consideration what we're hearing in the industry, what we're hearing from rating agencies, what we're hearing from auditors, what we're hearing from different groups, economists, central banks, investments. We take all these things into consideration, and we feel very comfortable where we are at this point in time. We have actually moved out in keeping that time period, that 10-year time period, in order to get to our long-term rate consistent, but we're from a different starting point, so you'll look at going out into the future. What we're hearing anecdotally is that others are starting to increase their trajectory or their time period as well. But still, we feel that our ultimate rate as well as our time period in order to get to the rate, we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. Hopefully that helps."

What we try to do is to make sure, Seth, that we're aligning our expenses with the revenue that we're able to generate. And as part of that process, as you might expect, we rigorously go through the organization to determine if there's services that were provided that are valued by our clients or they're unwilling to pay for. So I would say it's basic blocking and tackling, making sure that we have a disciplined approach to expense management. Now having said that, we're also continuing to make some very significant investments around digital and technology. Certainly, we've talked about the expenses related to the DOL implementation. And we're wanting to make sure we're still planting seeds within all of our businesses so we've got future growth. So I don't want anybody to walk away from the call or the quarter to think that somehow it's taking out all expenses at all cost because that's just not -- it's not the approach that we would take here at Principal.

If I look at the industry in institutional, the fee pressures depend a lot on which product and which asset category you're in. If you want a sort of rule of thumb, over the last 3 to 4 years, passive fees for institutions have roughly halved. When you look at large-scale, large-cap core assets in fixed income and equities, where there is a passive alternative, there has been intense fee pressure, and in the industry, those maybe halved over the last decade or 15 years. There is a whole area, however, of relatively newer, relatively less liquid, relatively less efficient markets, and those are areas where there is still quite a lot of pricing power and the fees have not moved for at least a decade, and that includes areas such as real estate, both public and private, high-yield, other investment grade fixed income and preferreds; all of which are areas we're strong in. And that's why our revenues have been quite buoyant relative to assets compared with most of the industry. So we have some carefully chosen, less liquid categories where active management still pays and where clients benefit from it and are prepared to pay. In the retail and mutual fund area, you can add some of those areas as helping the general performance. But the other piece to this, in terms of where fees are going, is our strength in multi-asset, multi-manager strategies, which are designed to produce an outcome that's desired by clients. Here, I think, target date, target risk, diversified income, diversified real asset. Those are areas where the outcome is beneficial to the client so the pricing is more resilient than it would be for the more commoditized passive and core areas. So we feel pretty good right now about where we are relative to the fee pressures in the industry. We need to become more efficient because pricing is going down. But I would say that relative to the industry, we feel very well-placed."

Tremendous scale with regard to services and record keeping in that platform, just tremendous scale. And with the consolidation in the industry, we're going to be a net gainer on that front. Two, and this is really critical, part of our retirement franchise -- well, 2 pieces of it. One is what we call Total Retirement Suite. We are one of very few competitors in the U.S. where you can have one-stop shopping with regard to your DB, your DC, your nonqual and you ESOP plan, and that is hugely valuable to our plan sponsors and our advisors with regard to that one-stop shopping. Three, and this is another critical piece, is we have one of the most extensive lineups of target-date funds in the U.S. and they're multi-managed, which is a real benefit in this environment. Multi-managed and hybrid, in other words, the choice not only around sub-advisors but also around passive versus active. We don't pick a position in that space. We have the choice, and what we've seen is plan sponsors really, really taking that particular investment product and putting a premium on that and the ability to have the one-stop shopping in addition to that qualified default option."

And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it",616,"Yes. Humphrey, thanks for your question. And let me say, first, that we're very pleased about the fact that, finally, the Chilean government is taking serious actions in order to review and propose a more comprehensive pension reform in Chile. That -- it might sounds to you a little bit counterintuitive, but I have to say also that Principal, since the early 2000, we're been a strong advocator in order to review the pension reform in Chile in a much more comprehensive way, as I said. The pension system, as you know, is the golden standard in sustainability, but it has some issues that has to be addressed about adequacy. And the most important problem is the one that's created the -- this kind of social unrest that you have seen. It's Pillar 0 that has nothing to do with the AFPs. It's the pillar that's being called the Solidarity Pillar and in which the government is in charge of. That pillar is very much more the one that's provided a safety net for low-income segment in Chile. And most of this low-income segment, they haven't been part of the labor force. If they were, they had a few contributions to the AFP system. For you to know this government, many governments even in the past, they hadn't take -- or they took a kind of free ride with the pension system. The total government retirement expenditure in the Pillar O is 0.7% of the GDP. Average for OECD countries is about 18% up to 20%. So here, we have the most important issue about adequacy in this pension system. The Chilean government, they sent very quickly a bill in order to raise their minimum pensions in Pillar 0 up to 10% last week. So they're reacting very quickly. Having said that, the government has to pay a lot of attention about Pillar O and Pillar 0, and that's where the most important initiatives about these whole discussions are going with. The second thing that we have to address in Chile, in this discussion is about the self-employed segment. They're not well covered. They don't have any compulsory contribution. They don't belong to any system and they have to. The third element is to put some adjustment for the AFP system, which are Pillar 1. Still, they start to do 10% contribution rate over salary. I mean, it's absolutely insufficient. Longer for -- I mean, lower for longer is an issue for every place, and Chileans are living longer as well. Also, they do have a salary cap, and their salary cap remains almost the same one in the last 30 years. At the beginning of the system, just 2% of the labor force was capped. Today, more than 20% of the labor force is capped. 35% of our customers in Cuprum are capped. So the 10% over year salary is even lower than 10%. So we have to address the 10%. We're advocating for a 15% minimum and to remove the salary cap. The third issue is to reinforce the Pillar 2, which is the workplace solutions and group solutions in that country. And we have, I would say, good and fairly trained in order to put and -- to put those, I will say, improvements. But I will say that the whole discussion is going to take a kind of long time in order to really have a solid and good, I will say, a pension reform. And I think that it's very unlikely that this current administration is going to be over to go through. I'm absolutely sure that probably this whole discussion is going to go over the next administration in 2018."

That is going to align the interest of our customers and our -- all the stakeholders in the AFP system. So we really do think that the system has to charge fees over AUMs. On average today, that discussion is going to help us in order to make much more clear that the pension system in Chile is one of the most efficient and cheapest. Around their 27 pensions plan that has been reviewed by Mercer in their annual review, on average, the pension system charge 60 basis point over AUMs. And in the case of Cuprum, we charge a number which is lower than that."

I guess the way I'd go at this is to, again, remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment",326,"Thanks, John. I guess the way I'd go at this is to, again, remind everyone on the call that our strategy in Chile does not limit itself just to the compulsory. That's the newest piece of business that we have. Second is the voluntary workplace environment that Luis very appropriately articulated. And the last piece is our ability to provide lifetime income to retirees. Again, all 3 of those are key components in the strategy. I don't think Chile is any different than the U.S., in the DOL debates that we're having today or some of the same challenges around the rest of the world, whether it was a conversation in Hong Kong. There is an outcry, I would suggest, about making sure that the fees are appropriate. And just like in the case of Chile and Hong Kong and U.S., there's conversation with the DOL and the various regulators around the world to make sure that they understand the products and services that are being provided for by the services companies. And we all know and we can speak to the issue of asset management, but the handholding, the call centers, the ability to provide information, education and advice, in some instances, is really the lifeblood of this business model around the world. And so as Luis was articulating, we've spent a lot of the time around the world educating regulators that there needs to be a reasonable fee associated with all of these products. So to answer your specific question, we're getting some outflows today in Chile, in large part, I believe, because some of the protests that were large 6 weeks ago that continue to get smaller and smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people participating. I don't think this is going to have any sort of meaningful impact on our flows or our ability to generate an earnings off the investments that we've made in Chile. Hopefully that helps."

What we try to do is we try to call out the significant items. In this particular quarter, we talked about 3 significant items, the one being the annual actuarial review. That had, obviously, a volatile number this quarter. But the large real estate sale that we had as well as the encaje performance, we felt that, that was a little bit more transparency, visibility into the volatility that we've seen. In terms of volatility, we -- I've talked in the past about real estate sales as well as prepayment activity generating anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 EPS. This quarter, we were significantly higher than that, well north of $0.12, $0.13. And so actually, this volatility that we called out brings us right back into that more normal range for that particular piece. But as I said, you'll have periods where the alternative investments might be a little bit higher or a little bit lower. The general account is actually growing, so you'd see some increase in the net income because of that. But we try to give you the best information possible in terms of the variance or volatility from what we would have expected.

Secondly, we don't see any sort of change as reflects our ability to continue to have a robust investment platform with proprietary investment options being made available to small- to medium-sized employers, certainly requires all the appropriate disclosure. And third, at benefit event for job changers and retirees, again, requires disclosure, but again, a workable model for the sake of being able to continue to provide our customers with choices at retirement, whether they decide to keep the money in the plan, choose a rollover IRA with Principal or to take their funds to a different services provider. And then lastly, as we've worked through our own broker-dealer and looking closely at our financial advisors, our 1,500-or-so financial advisors, we're retaining our talent.

Thanks for the question, Michael. That's probably a 30-minute response, but I'll give a relatively brief response, and what I would say is we have tried to really have a disciplined approach to capital deployment, whether it's to increase our dividends, stock buyback, making investments in our organic growth strategies here at Principal, being very cautious about, even within the organic lines, allocating that capital, where we can -- where we feel the shareholder is benefiting the most. And as you point out, we have had a nice track record of making relatively small tuck-in acquisitions. I wouldn't call Cuprum a tuck-in, but certainly, across asset management and asset accumulation, we've had some really, really nice acquisitions over the years. And I would say that we're going to continue to look for those opportunities and we're going to continue to take a larger ownership share in some of the boutiques that we've acquired in the past. You saw some of that traffic in the most recent quarter. We just believe fundamentally that's a great way to deploy capital for our shareholders. The other area that we want to emphasize is getting tangential strategies, where we've got an existing boutique where we can infuse some additional capital and maybe acquire some talent and build out that capability. Jim's also added some sales offices over the course of 2016 to try to drive sales. So that's still very, very much a part of our strategy. We feel like we've had really good organic growth in the core funds business. I don't think we'd have to necessarily acquire another fund's operation. And in terms of asset classes, we've talked about European real estate. We've talked about strategies that really align with what our investors' needs are, which is generating long-term income in retirement and long-dated solutions. Infrastructure is another area where we've looked at. So we're going to continue to be inquisitive where, again, we can deploy capital in the best interest of our long-term shareholders' needs.
