Welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
Before we get started, I'd like to thank Carl Berquist for his outstanding financial leadership over the last 14 years. During his tenure as CFO at Marriott, we announced the Starwood deal, acquired AC Hotels, Gaylord, Protea and Delta and created considerable value by spinning off our timeshare business. Further, he bought back nearly 150 million shares of stock at an average price of $47. He brought us through the tough times in 2009 and 2010, and like many of you, Carl remains a Marriott shareholder. Thank you, Carl, for everything.
I'd also like to welcome Leeny Oberg to the CFO position. Also a great leader, Leeny brings a wealth of Marriott experience, including project finance, international finance, corporate financial planning and most recently, CFO of our Ritz-Carlton organization. She started her career in backing and her Marriott carrier in Investor Relations so I know she will understand the street.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. 
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 18, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
To begin, the biggest Marriott news in 2015 was our announced acquisition of Starwood. The transaction is on track and we expect to close around midyear 2016. The S-4 went effective yesterday. We expect the proxy solicitation will be mailed to shareholders of both companies on or about February 19 to stockholders of record as of February 2. And a special shareholders meetings for both Marriott and Starwood are scheduled for March 28. 
We are seeking government approval for the transaction in multiple jurisdictions. Starwood's timeshare spinoff and merger with ILG is proceeding on schedule, and we do not expect this transaction to delay our acquisition of Starwood. 
While we are on track, Marriott and Starwood are still separate public companies and are limited in the information we may share with each other and you. So our discussions today about RevPAR, booking pace, pipeline, unit growth, EPS guidance and so forth are for the Marriott business only and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition. Like you, we eagerly await this afternoon's comments from Starwood about their business trends.
So let's get started. Attendance at the ALIS Conference in LA this year was a bit late due to the deluge of East Coast snow. But there was still a lot of conversation at the conference. And the #1 topic was the disconnect between stock performance and hotel fundamentals. 
Let's start with 2 facts about this business: first, it is cyclical, with demand highly correlated to GDP growth, capital investment and the employment; second, it has seasonality and can be sensitive to holidays, group bookings and special events. In any given quarter, it's sometimes difficult to see which of these aspects of the business are most impactful. 
This was true in the fourth quarter. System-wide North America RevPAR grew 5% in October, roughly 4% in November and just under 3% in December. We believe it was the modest growth in GDP in the fourth quarter that constrained our transient business, particularly premium rated business. As we typically have little group business during the holiday season, we turned to price-sensitive travelers, opening discounts for AAA members, seniors and others. As a result, our fourth quarter occupancy still reached near-record levels, although room rates were modestly weaker than anticipated.
Other factors also came into play. In Houston, system-wide RevPAR declined 8% in the quarter, reflecting weakness in the energy sector. While occupancy in our New York hotels remained very strong at 88%, our RevPAR growth in New York declined 1% as new supply constrained pricing. In San Francisco, RevPAR growth moderated from earlier in the year, rising only 6% in the quarter as high prices detoured guests to more affordable destinations like Los Angeles where our RevPAR saw a double-digit increase. 
Make no mistake, business travelers are on the road. While the energy and manufacturing sectors were weak in the quarter, we saw significant strength in technology, professional services, health care, pharmaceuticals, automotive and media. In fact, room sales from our nearly 300 largest corporate customers increased 4% in the fourth quarter, 7% excluding energy and manufacturing companies.
And near-term transient trends in North America are improving. System-wide, total transient revenue increased roughly 2% in December and nearly 2.5% in a very snowy January. For February, transient revenue on the books is up nearly 4% to date. For the full year, our special corporate customers tell us they expect to travel at least as much in 2016 as in 2015. And with special corporate negotiations nearly complete, we expect special corporate pricing to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016. 
Group business is even stronger. North American group revenue in the fourth quarter increased 6% and attendance at meetings exceeded expectations. Catering revenue also increased 6%, with considerable last-minute food and beverage upgrades. New group business booked in the fourth quarter for any period in the future increased 10% year-over-year. 
Group revenue booking pace for the first quarter of 2016 is up 2%, reflecting the shift in timing of Easter year-over-year. Not surprisingly, the second quarter is much stronger, with revenue pace up 9%. For the full year 2016, group revenue booking pace is up 7%. Incidentally, with very high occupancy rates and limited hotel meeting space, groups are booking earlier. Group revenue booking pace for 2017 is up 8% while 2018 is up 9%.
So what does this mean for RevPAR guidance? With the tough Easter comparison, we expect 2% to 4% RevPAR growth in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect North American RevPAR growth at the upper end of 3% to 5%. Our full year outlook is tempered a bit from our October view due to incremental weakness in the energy and manufacturing sectors and a modestly lower GDP growth assumption for 2016. 
Elsewhere in the world, economies in Italy and Spain are recovering nicely, while German economic growth has cooled with fewer exports to China. Despite Russia's ongoing recession, we saw higher domestic demand in our hotels in Moscow in the fourth quarter. 
Security concerns continue to weigh on demand in Paris and Brussels, and to a lesser extent, in London. In 2015, Europe represented 7% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect Europe's RevPAR to increase at a low single-digit rate. 
In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR declined in the fourth quarter due to security concerns, low oil prices and Dubai oversupply. For 2016, we are modeling low single-digit RevPAR growth. As expected, infrastructure investment in UAE and Qatar, economic growth in Africa and easing comparison in Egypt should improve results late in the year. In 2015, the Middle East and Africa represented 3% of our worldwide fee revenue.
In the Asia Pacific region, China's economic growth moderated in 2015, yet Mainland China RevPAR still rose roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. Chinese consumers continue to spend. In fact, international travel from Mainland China to our hotels in other markets increased 31%. 
In India, the improving economy drove RevPAR up 12%. In 2015, the Asia Pacific region accounted for 8% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect the Asia Pacific region will continue to grow RevPAR at a mid-single-digit rate, with continued strength in India, Japan and Thailand.
In the Caribbean and Latin America region, solid economic growth in Mexico is driving both RevPAR and hotel expansion. While the Caribbean remains an attractive venue for groups and an appealing warm weather playground for tourists, particularly after they dig out from under 2 feet of snow. 
We've seen a few cancellations due to the Zika virus and are watching this carefully. Hotels in affected areas are fogging outdoor areas, providing mosquito repellent for guests and dealing with areas of standing water. While Brazil remains in recession, we are hopeful that the Summer Olympics will lift RevPAR in that market in 2016. 
For the full year, we expect RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2015, the region accounted for 4% of our worldwide fee revenue. All in all, we believe our worldwide system-wide RevPAR will grow at 3% to 5% for the year. 
Our system grew by nearly 52,000 rooms in 2015, 11,000 in the fourth quarter alone, taking our system to nearly 760,000 rooms worldwide. New owner and franchisee signings in 2015 reached a record 104,000 rooms, taking our development pipeline to more than 270,000 rooms, another new high. Our brands continue to be preferred by hotel developers. According to STR, at year-end 2015, 27% of hotels under construction in North America were affiliated with one of Marriott brands, more than any other hotel company.
Outside North America, in recent years, we've enhanced growth and increased speed to market by decentralizing decision-making, tailoring leading brands to local market tastes and building relationships with local partners to drive development. This has really made a difference to our limited-service brands. 
In fact, in the past 5 years, our limited-service portfolio outside North America has more than tripled to 316 hotels, with another 250 hotels in the development pipeline. Consistent with this strategy, yesterday, we announced a long-term agreement with Eastern Crown Hotels Group for development of Fairfield Hotels in China. 
Demand for economy tier lodging has grown rapidly in China in a relatively short period of time as the middle class has rapidly expanded. Eastern Crown is targeting 140 signed deals over 5 years, including 100 Fairfield Hotels expected to open by 2021. 
Worldwide, with our strong brands and deep development pipeline, in 2016, we expect our rooms will increase by roughly 7%, net of dilutions. While not included in our growth targets, nevertheless, we expect our worldwide system will take a significant leap forward with the completion of the Starwood acquisition. This transaction will expand our presence around the world, broaden our appeal to younger travelers and increase the growth opportunities for Starwood's valuable brands. 
In addition, the combination of Starwood's leading lifestyle brands with Marriott's strong presence across the select-service and luxury tiers as well as our convention and resort segment will create a very attractive portfolio that should be more appealing to guests and meeting planners and thus more appealing to owners and franchisees as well. 
We believe the transaction offers meaningful opportunities for shareholders, hotel owners and hotel franchisees through enhanced growth and improved efficiency. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's spreads by leveraging our hotel development expertise and strong relationships. We continue to estimate that we will achieve annual run rate synergies of at least $200 million by the second full year after closing. 
Excluding transition and transaction costs, we continue to expect the transaction will be EPS accretive in the second full year after closing. We know you have many questions about our brand strategies, integration plans and specific efficiency opportunities. We don't have answers for you today and ask for your patience as we work through these decisions and plans. We believe this transaction will create substantial value for Marriott and Starwood shareholders and look forward to working aggressively towards its completion. 
In Marriott's history, there have been a few profound decisions that changed the company's course and have launched us to greater success. In 1979, we sold our first portfolio of owned hotels and became hotel managers. In 1993, we created Host Hotels, further reducing our real estate focus and stepping up franchising. We became a pure-play lodging company just 5 years ago, with the spinoff of our timeshare business. 
We believe this acquisition is as significant. It will make us the largest hotel company in the world, focused solely on management and franchising with a very strong portfolio of great brands, powerful loyalty programs and terrific prospects for the future. Now to provide more information about the fourth quarter and our 2016 outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny?"

Marriott is known for its quality brand portfolio and asset-light business model. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you also know we're serious about transparent disclosures and delivering high returns to shareholders. While the Starwood transaction will do much to change Marriott, it won't change those commitments. I'm looking forward to getting to know as many of you as possible in the coming months. So let's look at the results.
2015 was a great year. Worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 5% on a constant dollar basis. Total fee revenue reached $1.9 billion, constrained by about $32 million of foreign exchange. Incentive fees in North America increased 18%, largely due to strong performance at our limited-service hotels in our California and Florida resorts. 
For the full year 2015, the percentage of North American hotels paying incentive fees increased from 36% to 63%. The increase in the number of hotels paying fees was largely due to 3 portfolios of limited-service hotels that earned $7 million in incentive fees in the full year 2015 and are expected to earn higher incentive fees amounts in 2016. 
Incentive fees from our international hotels declined during the year, primarily due to $15 million of foreign exchange headwinds. In the fourth quarter, worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 4% on a constant dollar basis and 2% on an actual dollar basis. Total fee revenue in the quarter increased 6%, constrained by $12 million of foreign exchange. 
Our hotels did an outstanding job in the fourth quarter as they focused on the bottom line. House profit margins at company-operated hotels increased 90 basis points in North America and 70 basis points worldwide. House profit per available room rose faster than RevPAR, up 9% in North America and 7% worldwide. 
Fourth quarter incentive fees in North America increased 20% to $33 million, with particular strength in full-service hotels in Florida and Washington, D.C. Incentive fees in international markets declined 12% in the quarter, reflecting tough foreign exchange comparisons and a few weak markets in the Middle East and Latin America. 
Owned, leased and other revenue declined 7% in the quarter, largely due to weaker revenue growth at a hotel under renovation and unfavorable foreign exchange. Net of expenses, owned, leased and other increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to higher termination fees and lower preopening expenses. 
General and administrative expenses increased 4% in the quarter, reflecting $5 million in transaction costs associated with the Starwood acquisition and higher net hotel development costs. We received $62 million in cash in the fourth quarter for our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton Hotel. For the full year 2015, we recycled nearly $950 million from asset sales, investment redemptions and note collection. Our fourth quarter tax rate was lower than expected, largely due to the St. Thomas transaction and a favorable IRS settlement. We expect our book tax rate to be roughly 32.3% in 2016.
In the first quarter of 2016, our 2% to 4% expected RevPAR growth and continued unit expansion should yield $475 million to $485 million in fee revenue. We are expecting $13 million in lower relicensing fees for the quarter versus last year. 
Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, should be flattish in the first quarter due to tough comparisons to last year. As I mentioned, we recently sold the St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton. As an owned hotel, in its seasonally strong first quarter of 2015, the property earned nearly $6 million. 
First quarter G&A should total roughly $160 million. We still have a tough comparison to $13 million in favorable litigation settlements in the prior year. Our G&A estimate does not include Starwood acquisition-related expenses. All in all, we expect EPS for the first quarter will total $0.81 to $0.85.
For the full year, with 3% to 5% worldwide RevPAR growth and roughly 7% net unit growth, we expect fee revenue will increase 7% to 9% to reach roughly $2 billion. We expect roughly $30 million negative FX impact on year-over-year fee revenue growth in 2016. Even including FX impact, we expect incentive fees will increase at a 10% to 15% growth rate with continued strength in North America. 
We expect full year owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, will increase roughly 20%, reflecting the impact of completed hotel renovation and higher branding fees from residential sales as several projects should begin sales during the year. Further, we expect higher credit card branding fees, with growth in new accounts and cardholder sales. We expect general and administrative costs will increase 3% to 4% in 2016, a 3% to 4% decline on a per room basis.
Net interest expense should increase to roughly $160 million, reflecting both higher borrowings and higher interest income. All combined, we expect 2016 fully diluted EPS will total $3.69 to $3.86, an increase of 17% to 23%. Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 should grow 10% to 14%.
We understand there are a variety of opinions about likely economic growth. Our 2016 outlook assumes roughly 2.5% growth in U.S. GDP. For those of you with more bearish economic views, we believe that flat U.S. GDP would still likely yield roughly 2% RevPAR growth at our hotels in North America, given today's supply environment. Given our significant management and franchised business, we expect this scenario would still yield midteens 2016 EPS growth and high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.
Remember, our guidance excludes the pending Starwood acquisition. We expect the P&L impact of Starwood will be very noisy in 2016 due to the transition and transaction costs. We will provide more information about the transaction during the second quarter earnings call.
Investment spending in 2016 should total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance CapEx spending. With few owned assets remaining, we expect asset sales and loan repayments will total roughly $200 million to $250 million. 
Our business strategy enables us to grow rapidly in a strong market and continue to deliver attractive returns in a weaker one. Compared to 2007, today, we have 40% more rooms in our system worldwide. Our development pipeline is deeper. Our cash flow is less volatile. We are out of the timeshare business. And while we still earn attractive incentive fees, those fees represented only 17% of fee revenue in 2015 compared to 26% in 2007. 
Today, we estimate that a 1-point change in our RevPAR outlook across our system for the full year 2016, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $25 million in fees and roughly $3 million of owned, leased and other net. Even after completion of the Starwood transaction, we intend to remain a solid investment grade company with strong access to capital markets. We will be out of the market until after the special shareholders meetings but expect to resume share repurchases as soon as possible thereafter. In fact, we expect to return more than $2 billion to shareholders in 2016 through share repurchases and dividends just from our legacy Marriott business. With the Starwood transaction, returns to shareholders could be meaningfully higher.
As we approach the integration of Marriott and Starwood, we've identified a few guiding principles. We will continue to put people first. This is our cultural touchstone because taking care of associates enables them to take care of the guests. We recognize customer service is the foundation of every lodging brand and RevPAR premiums. 
Throughout the integration process, we intend to drive results for owners and franchisees to help enhance the value of their hotel investment. For shareholders, we will continue to look for ways to leverage the scale and opportunities from this transaction to drive value beyond the base case synergies we've outlined for you, and we intend to do all of this as quickly as possible. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Laurie, we'll take questions now."

At the same time, obviously, Starwood is a much bigger deal than any of those were, which presents some positive differences and then some greater challenges. I think on the positive side, Starwood is hopefully less distracted by the process of the sale of the company. And you've got a big talented group of folks over there running 350,000 rooms or so. But I know the Starwood team, with our encouragement, is very much focused on continuing to drive sales and to drive the development engine. And we've taken steps to try and put our arms around those teams of folks so that they are as little distracted by this as possible. I think some of the other deals we did early it was that sales engine, which looked like it got distracted during a sales process and to some extent between the negotiated -- or the signing of a deal and the closing of a deal. And we're doing everything we can to plan for integration of systems and integration of business units between now and when we close so that we can implement those as quickly as possible.

So obviously, we would assume that -- and hope that once we've acquired Starwood, that you would see share repurchase go even higher than the numbers that we've presented. But what we've talked about is that we could see a total capital return to shareholders of over $2 billion in 2016. That will have the roughly similar sort of payout on the dividend side and the rest in share repurchase. First quarter is obviously quite constrained. And basically, what you've seen us buy to date is probably pretty much it, given that now until shareholder vote, we're out of the market. But then we look forward to being back in the market as aggressively as we can and look forward to those numbers, assuming all goes well for the rest of the year. And I wouldn't..."

I mean, I think the transient obviously is both a business and leisure, and then you get the leisure piece of it. But I think we will see transient grow in about the same range. Let me just talk a little bit more about the philosophy around our RevPA",430,"Yes. I mean, I think the transient obviously is both a business and leisure, and then you get the leisure piece of it. But I think we will see transient grow in about the same range. Let me just talk a little bit more about the philosophy around our RevPAR guidance of 3% to 5% for 2016, which has been noted obviously the number of early reports that have come out, that, that's a point lower than what we thought a quarter ago. What's changed between then and now, I think we look at a world in which there's obviously more anxiety in the marketplace. There's a bit more anxiety about what GDP growth is going to look like in 2016. And as a consequence, we've been a bit more conservative in the forecast that we've provided. When we look internally at our own sort of budgets that are rolled up by hotel, this is a U.S.-focused comment obviously, I think our expectations have maybe declined by about 0.5 point from where we guessed they were a quarter ago. And that's why we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our expectation is sort of towards the higher end of that 3% to 5%. But there's enough uncertainty out there that we thought the 3% to 5% range is probably a more constructive place for us to be than to try and move it by only 0.5 point. It gives us a little bit more room to see what happens with GDP growth. Transient business is the hardest to predict because it does not really have much of a long lead time, particularly with business travelers. There, you're really talking about days or maybe 1 week or 2. Leisure tends to be a little bit longer than that. But what we see is again reasonably encouraging. The sky is not falling when we look at our data. That is profoundly the case when you look at group business but it is also very much the case when you look at transient business. We mentioned the 2.5% transient demand in January. We look at U.S. system-wide RevPAR numbers, and they were up a hair over 3% in the month of January. And we think that probably had nearly 1-point impact because of the blizzard on the East Coast. And so all things considered, that's not bad and we'd expect February to be better. That's a longer answer than you asked for. But generally, we would expect transient to be a bit lower than group but still in meaningful mid-digit -- mid-single-digit range."

And there are opportunities in both of those places. So when you think about revenue synergies, the hardest things for us to put a number out there, we don't have one for you now. Hopefully, when we get to a point of digesting the acquisition and sharing in more detail with all of you our plans, we can be a little bit more specific about it. But the basic notion is how do you take these 2 leading loyalty programs in the industry, Marriott Rewards and SPG, and create something which is even more powerful? And by doing that, take greater share of the business for the members of those 2 programs and drive top line revenue for the hotels that are in the system. I think when you get to the cost side, we'll find hopefully that we are less reliant on the most expensive sources of third-party business. Over time, I think we'll find that there are opportunities in procurement. I think we'll find that there are efficiencies and systems costs that can be driven in -- as a result of going to 1 system instead of having 2. And I think we'll find lots of opportunities to really again both drive the top line and the bottom line. So we feel really good about this. I think the only thing we hear in response to the deal that is a community that says please reassure us is rewards and SPG members want to make sure that their points are protected and that they don't have anything to fear. And we've been assuring both of those communities that the principal reason for our doing this deal is actually to redouble our commitment to them and make them feel even better about their loyalty to us so that they need not be worried.

But I think the weakness in the financial markets, which does impact confidence, particularly among financial players, is making debt financing, I think, more difficult today than it was a few months ago. And as a consequence, I suspect that some of these deals which have recently been signed will be harder to get financed than deals that were signed maybe a year ago. And so if there's a risk here in the near term, it is that some of these deals either will get delayed to some extent or some may even be killed if debt financing cannot be made available. It's going to vary a little bit by type of owner partner or franchisee partner. I think those that are -- tend to be in the center part of the country more conservatively financed. More regional banks probably will continue to be less impacted by this sort of increased anxiety. I think those that are less institutional, more classically project finance as opposed to balance sheet financed, I think there's a greater risk that some of those projects may be delayed."

I think you've heard that we expect once the transaction gets -- once the integration occurs, that we're looking at $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of cash coming from the asset sales. We would continue to look forward to seeing that. In terms of the market out there, as you know, it's very asset-specific, very asset-dependent.

The -- obviously, we've been bombarded with news about the Chinese economy over the last couple of quarters, most of it not very positive in what we read in the papers here. And obviously, a big chunk of that is related to their manufacturing export business, to some extent, related to their infrastructure spending and, to some extent, to their financial markets and financial institutions. I think underneath all of that, you've got China continuing to move towards a consumer economy. You've got a growing middle class that has resources to expend on things other than bare necessities. And as a consequence, I think we see in our industry and certainly at Marriott, a stronger performance in China than you might expect from reading the newspaper. Obviously, it is a very big market, and so the performance in different cities will vary from place to place. We had some of the numbers in our [indiscernible] Shanghai continues to be a very strong market all the way through 2015. Hong Kong by contrast has been a market which has been under pressure, in part because the political implications of some of the street protests and other decisions that are made that derive from them. But then you look at other markets like Japan. China visitation to Japan was up something like 25% or 30% last year if memory serves. And it is driving great performance in our Japanese hotels. And you see that, that sort of growth in outbound China business continuing to perform really well. And what we see so far in 2016 continues to make us quite positive about China. Not to be sure that China New Year's has shifted from January to February so we'll have to get through February and see exactly how the dust settles. But we're feeling pretty good about China, we're feeling pretty good about Asia. When it comes to MVW and ILG and their interest in the loyalty programs, this is a -- it's going to be a really fun set of issues to work through. Obviously, we've already talked about the strategic importance of using these loyalty programs to both grow our loyal customer base and to intensify our relationships with them. And we think SPG and Marriott Rewards give us a perfect opportunity to do that. At the same time, we have in MVW and ILG companies, which are keenly interested in making sure that they can continue to market Marriott timeshare to the Marriott Rewards folks and Starwood timeshare to the SPG folks. Similarly, we have credit card partners in those 2 programs, FedEx with -- or FedEx, AmEx, excuse me, with SPG and JPMorgan Chase Visa with Marriott Rewards. And we'll work through those things with both. We don't fear either of those issues though and think actually that we will find a way to create great value for us and our customers as well as for those partners."

And we don't know how long that's going to take -- really Starwood has work that is underway there, and we have some sense for what the options are there, but we've got a lot more work to do. And so it's a long-winded way of saying we do have some assumptions about share repurchase over the first few years in the model. As with all of our share repurchase assumption, that tends to have stock prices when we're buying back stock at sort of normal multiples and growing stock prices when you look at the Marriott standalone model or the combined multiple. And so they are not as profound in driving EPS accretion as you might think if you sat here and said, ""Okay, well what if you buy back all the stock at today's stock price?"" for example. But we'll work through that. I think there is just state the obvious, the more we can convert the acquisition of Starwood to a cash deal by buying back stock sooner, particularly at the kind of values the market is attributing to the companies today, the more we like that deal, and it becomes something which is a no-brainer attractive transaction for us. And so where we end up exactly in this, we'll have to see what happens with the stock price but what happens with cash management issues that we need to get through."

One of the unknowables for us is what the tax base is on those properties today. And my question is, what happens to that tax basis by virtue of the acquisition as we go through it because ultimately, that helps us estimate what the gross proceed -- or what the net proceeds will be on an after-tax basis."

The $1.5 billion to $2 billion that Leeny referenced before is net of our estimate of what the taxes will be. And it is not enormously punitive to the transaction. It's in, if I remember, a 10% to 15% range of gross proceeds, something like that. There, generally though, is not an impact on tax basis from the transaction since we're acquiring the of the parent company. And whether those assumptions turn out to be exactly right, we'll have to see as we get further into it. You're right though to talk about asset sales because that will be one of the things that has a significant impact to both the amount and pace of share repurchases. I think it's -- without getting into the details, it is crystal clear that from an earnings perspective, these -- these hotels can be sold in every instance at dramatically higher multiples than what the earnings contribution are from them. When you look at EBITDA multiples, it becomes a little bit closer, but even there, it's a great portfolio of assets that we would think in virtually all instances. And again, take this all with a little bit of grain of salt since there's still a lot that we don't know. But in virtually all instances, we would think that the prices available would be at higher EBITDA multiples than the companies are trading them, which just gives us that much more conviction that we ought to continue with the strategy we've had for a number of years, which is to be focused on management franchising and not on owning real estate."

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
Before we get started, I'd like to thank Carl Berquist for his outstanding financial leadership over the last 14 years. During his tenure as CFO at Marriott, we announced the Starwood deal, acquired AC Hotels, Gaylord, Protea and Delta, and created considerable value by spinning off our timeshare business. Further, he bought back nearly 150 million shares of stock at an average price of $47. He brought us through the tough times in 2009 and 2010. And like many of you, Carl remains a Marriott shareholder. Thank you, Carl, for everything.
I'd also like to welcome Leeny Oberg to the CFO position. Also a great leader, Leeny brings a wealth of Marriott experience, including project finance, international finance, corporate financial planning and most recently, CFO of our Ritz-Carlton organization. She started her career in banking and her Marriott carrier in Investor Relations, so I know she will understand the street.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. 
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 18, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
To begin, the biggest Marriott news in 2015 was our announced acquisition of Starwood. The transaction is on track, and we expect to close around midyear 2016. The S-4 went effective yesterday. We expect the proxy solicitation will be mailed to shareholders of both companies on or about February 19 to stockholders of record as of February 2. And a special shareholders meetings for both Marriott and Starwood are scheduled for March 28. 
We are seeking government approval for the transaction in multiple jurisdictions. Starwood's timeshare spinoff and merger with ILG is proceeding on schedule, and we do not expect this transaction to delay our acquisition of Starwood. 
While we are on track, Marriott and Starwood are still separate public companies and are limited in the information we may share with each other and you. So our discussions today about RevPAR, booking pace, pipeline, unit growth, EPS guidance and so forth are for the Marriott business only and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition. Like you, we eagerly await this afternoon's comments from Starwood about their business trends.
So let's get started. Attendance at the ALIS Conference in LA of this year was a bit late due to the deluge of East Coast snow. But there was still a lot of conversation at the conference. And the #1 topic was the disconnect between stock performance and hotel fundamentals. 
Let's start with 2 facts about this business. First, it is cyclical, with demand highly correlated to GDP growth, capital investment and the employment. Second, it has seasonality and can be sensitive to holidays, group bookings and special events. In any given quarter, it's sometimes difficult to see which of these aspects of the business are most impactful. 
This was true in the fourth quarter. System-wide North America RevPAR grew 5% in October, roughly 4% in November and just under 3% in December. We believe it was the modest growth in GDP in the fourth quarter that constrained our transient business, particularly premium-rated business. As we typically have little group business during the holiday season, we turned to price-sensitive travelers, opening discounts for AAA members, seniors and others. As a result, our fourth quarter occupancy still reached near-record levels, although room rates were modestly weaker than anticipated.
Other factors also came into play. In Houston, system-wide RevPAR declined 8% in the quarter, reflecting weakness in the energy sector. While occupancy in our New York hotels remain very strong at 88%, our RevPAR growth in New York declined 1% as new supply constrained pricing. In San Francisco, RevPAR growth moderated from earlier in the year, rising only 6% in the quarter, as high prices detoured guests to more affordable destinations like Los Angeles, where our RevPAR saw a double-digit increase. 
Make no mistake, business travelers are on the road. While the energy and manufacturing sectors were weak in the quarter, we saw significant strength in technology, professional services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, automotive and media. In fact, room sales from our nearly 300 largest corporate customers increased 4% in the fourth quarter, 7% excluding energy and manufacturing companies.
And near-term transient trends in North America are improving. System-wide, total transient revenue increased roughly 2% in December and nearly 2.5% in a very snowy January. For February, transient revenue on the books is up nearly 4% to date. For the full year, our special corporate customers tell us they expect to travel at least as much in 2016 as in 2015. And with special corporate negotiations nearly complete, we expect special corporate pricing to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016. 
Group business is even stronger. North American group revenue in the fourth quarter increased 6% and attendance at meetings exceeded expectations. Catering revenue also increased 6%, with considerable last-minute food and beverage upgrades. New group business booked in the fourth quarter for any period in the future increased 10% year-over-year. 
Group revenue booking pace for the first quarter of 2016 is up 2%, reflecting the shift in timing of Easter year-over-year. Not surprisingly, the second quarter is much stronger, with revenue pace up 9%. For the full year 2016, group revenue booking pace is up 7%. Incidentally, with very high occupancy rates and limited hotel meeting space, groups are booking earlier. Group revenue booking pace for 2017 is up 8%, while 2018 is up 9%.
So what does this mean for RevPAR guidance? With the tough Easter comparison, we expect 2% to 4% RevPAR growth in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect North American RevPAR growth at the upper end of 3% to 5%. Our full year outlook is tempered a bit from our October view due to incremental weakness in the energy and manufacturing sectors and a modestly lower GDP growth assumption for 2016. 
Elsewhere in the world, economies in Italy and Spain are recovering nicely, while German economic growth has cooled with fewer exports to China. Despite Russia's ongoing recession, we saw higher domestic demand in our hotels in Moscow in the fourth quarter. 
Security concerns continue to weigh on demand in Paris and Brussels and, to a lesser extent, in London. In 2015, Europe represented 7% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect Europe's RevPAR to increase at a low single-digit rate. 
In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR declined in the fourth quarter due to security concerns, low oil prices and Dubai oversupply. For 2016, we are modeling low single-digit RevPAR growth. As expected, infrastructure investment in UAE and Qatar, economic growth in Africa and easing comparison in Egypt should improve results late in the year. In 2015, the Middle East and Africa represented 3% of our worldwide fee revenue.
In the Asia Pacific region, China's economic growth moderated in 2015, yet Mainland China RevPAR still rose roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. Chinese consumers continue to spend. In fact, international travel from Mainland China to our hotels in other markets increased 31%. 
In India, the improving economy drove RevPAR up 12%. In 2015, the Asia Pacific region accounted for 8% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect the Asia Pacific region will continue to grow RevPAR at a mid-single-digit rate, with continued strength in India, Japan and Thailand.
In the Caribbean and Latin America region, solid economic growth in Mexico is driving both RevPAR and hotel expansion, while the Caribbean remains an attractive venue for groups and an appealing warm weather playground for tourists, particularly after they dig out from under 2 feet of snow. 
We've seen a few cancellations due to the Zika virus and are watching this carefully. Hotels in affected areas are fogging outdoor areas, providing mosquito repellent for guests and dealing with areas of standing water. While Brazil remains in recession, we are hopeful that the Summer Olympics will lift RevPAR in that market in 2016. 
For the full year, we expect RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2015, the region accounted for 4% of our worldwide fee revenue. All in all, we believe our worldwide system-wide RevPAR will grow at 3% to 5% for the year. 
Our system grew by nearly 52,000 rooms in 2015, 11,000 in the fourth quarter alone, taking our system to nearly 760,000 rooms worldwide. New owner and franchisee signings in 2015 reached a record 104,000 rooms, taking our development pipeline to more than 270,000 rooms, another new high. Our brands continue to be preferred by hotel developers. According to STR, at year-end 2015, 27% of hotels under construction in North America were affiliated with one of Marriott brands, more than any other hotel company.
Outside North America, in recent years, we've enhanced growth and increased speed to market by decentralizing decision-making, tailoring brands to local market tastes and building relationships with local partners to drive development. This has really made a difference to our limited-service brands. 
In fact, in the past 5 years, our limited-service portfolio outside North America has more than tripled to 316 hotels, with another 250 hotels in the development pipeline. Consistent with this strategy, yesterday, we announced a long-term agreement with Eastern Crown Hotels Group for development of Fairfield hotels in China. 
Demand for economy tier lodging has grown rapidly in China in a relatively short period of time, as the middle class has rapidly expanded. Eastern Crown is targeting 140 signed deals over 5 years, including 100 Fairfield hotels expected to open by 2021. 
Worldwide, with our strong brands and deep development pipeline, in 2016, we expect our rooms will increase by roughly 7%, net of dilutions. While not included in our growth targets, nevertheless, we expect our worldwide system will take a significant leap forward with the completion of the Starwood acquisition. This transaction will expand our presence around the world, broaden our appeal to younger travelers and increase the growth opportunities for Starwood's valuable brands. 
In addition, the combination of Starwood's leading lifestyle brands with Marriott's strong presence across the select-service and luxury tiers, as well as our convention and resort segment, will create a very attractive portfolio that should be more appealing to guests and meeting planners, and thus, more appealing to owners and franchisees as well. 
We believe the transaction offers meaningful opportunities for shareholders, hotel owners and hotel franchisees through enhanced growth and improved efficiency. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's brands by leveraging our hotel development expertise and strong relationships. We continue to estimate that we will achieve annual run rate synergies of at least $200 million by the second full year after closing. 
Excluding transition and transaction costs, we continue to expect the transaction will be EPS-accretive in the second full year after closing. We know you have many questions about our brand strategies, integration plans and specific efficiency opportunities. We don't have answers for you today and ask for your patience as we work through these decisions and plans. We believe this transaction will create substantial value for Marriott and Starwood shareholders and look forward to working aggressively towards its completion. 
In Marriott's history, there have been a few profound decisions that changed the company's course and launched us to greater success. In 1979, we sold our first portfolio of owned hotels and became hotel managers. In 1993, we created Host Hotels, further reducing our real estate focus and stepping up franchising. We became a pure-play lodging company just 5 years ago with the spinoff of our timeshare business. 
We believe this acquisition is as significant. It will make us the largest hotel company in the world, focused solely on management and franchising, with a very strong portfolio of great brands, powerful loyalty programs and terrific prospects for the future. Now to provide more information about the fourth quarter and our 2016 outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny?"

Marriott is known for its quality brand portfolio and asset-light business model. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you also know we're serious about transparent disclosures and delivering high returns to shareholders. While the Starwood transaction will do much to change Marriott, it won't change those commitments. I'm looking forward to getting to know as many of you as possible in the coming months. So let's look at the results.
2015 was a great year. Worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 5% on a constant dollar basis. Total fee revenue reached $1.9 billion, constrained by about $32 million of foreign exchange. Incentive fees in North America increased 18%, largely due to strong performance at our limited-service hotels in our California and Florida resorts. 
For the full year 2015, the percentage of North American hotels paying incentive fees increased from 36% to 63%. The increase in the number of hotels paying fees was largely due to 3 portfolios of limited-service hotels that earned $7 million in incentive fees in the full year 2015 and are expected to earn higher incentive fees amounts in 2016. 
Incentive fees from our international hotels declined during the year, primarily due to $15 million of foreign exchange headwind. In the fourth quarter, worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 4% on a constant dollar basis and 2% on an actual dollar basis. Total fee revenue in the quarter increased 6%, constrained by $12 million of foreign exchange. 
Our hotels did an outstanding job in the fourth quarter as they focused on the bottom line. House profit margins at company-operated hotels increased 90 basis points in North America and 70 basis points worldwide. House profit per available room rose faster than RevPAR, up 9% in North America and 7% worldwide. 
Fourth quarter incentive fees in North America increased 20% to $33 million, with particular strength in full-service hotels in Florida and Washington, D.C. Incentive fees in international markets declined 12% in the quarter, reflecting tough foreign exchange comparisons and a few weak markets in the Middle East and Latin America. 
Owned, leased and other revenue declined 7% in the quarter, largely due to weaker revenue growth at a hotel under renovation and unfavorable foreign exchange. Net of expenses, owned, leased and other increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to higher termination fees and lower preopening expenses. 
General and administrative expenses increased 4% in the quarter, reflecting $5 million in transaction costs associated with the Starwood acquisition and higher net hotel development costs. We received $62 million in cash in the fourth quarter for our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton Hotel. For the full year 2015, we recycled nearly $950 million from asset sales, investment redemptions and note collections. Our fourth quarter tax rate was lower than expected, largely due to the St. Thomas transaction and a favorable IRS settlement. We expect our book tax rate to be roughly 32.3% in 2016.
In the first quarter of 2016, our 2% to 4% expected RevPAR growth and continued unit expansion should yield $475 million to $485 million in fee revenue. We are expecting $13 million in lower relicensing fees for the quarter versus last year. 
Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, should be flattish in the first quarter due to tough comparisons to last year. As I mentioned, we recently sold the St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton. As an owned hotel, in its seasonally strong first quarter of 2015, the property earned nearly $6 million. 
First quarter G&A should total roughly $160 million. We still have a tough comparison to $13 million in favorable litigation settlements in the prior year. Our G&A estimate does not include Starwood acquisition-related expenses. All in all, we expect EPS for the first quarter will total $0.81 to $0.85.
For the full year, with 3% to 5% worldwide RevPAR growth and roughly 7% net unit growth, we expect fee revenue will increase 7% to 9% to reach roughly $2 billion. We expect roughly $30 million negative FX impact on year-over-year fee revenue growth in 2016. Even including FX impact, we expect incentive fees will increase at a 10% to 15% growth rate with continued strength in North America. 
We expect full year owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, will increase roughly 20%, reflecting the impact of completed hotel renovation and higher branding fees from residential sales as several projects should begin sales during the year. Further, we expect higher credit card branding fees, with growth in new accounts and cardholder sales. We expect general and administrative costs will increase 3% to 4% in 2016, a 3% to 4% decline on a per room basis.
Net interest expense should increase to roughly $160 million, reflecting both higher borrowings and higher interest income. All combined, we expect 2016 fully diluted EPS will total $3.69 to $3.86, an increase of 17% to 23%. Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 should grow 10% to 14%.
We understand there are a variety of opinions about likely economic growth. Our 2016 outlook assumes roughly 2.5% growth in U.S. GDP. For those of you with more bearish economic views, we believe that flat U.S. GDP would still likely yield roughly 2% RevPAR growth at our hotels in North America, given today's supply environment. Given our significant management and franchised business, we expect this scenario would still yield mid-teens 2016 EPS growth and high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.
Remember, our guidance excludes the pending Starwood acquisition. We expect the P&L impact of Starwood will be very noisy in 2016 due to the transition and transaction costs. We will provide more information about the transaction during the second quarter earnings call.
Investment spending in 2016 should total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance CapEx spending. With few owned assets remaining, we expect asset sales and loan repayments will total roughly $200 million to $250 million. 
Our business strategy enables us to grow rapidly in a strong market and continue to deliver attractive returns in a weaker one. Compared to 2007, today, we have 40% more rooms in our system worldwide. Our development pipeline is deeper. Our cash flow is less volatile. We are out of the timeshare business. And while we still earn attractive incentive fees, those fees represented only 17% of fee revenue in 2015 compared to 26% in 2007. 
Today, we estimate that a 1-point change in our RevPAR outlook across our system for the full year 2016, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $25 million in fees and roughly $3 million of owned, leased and other net. Even after completion of the Starwood transaction, we intend to remain a solid investment grade company with strong access to capital markets. We will be out of the market until after the special shareholders meetings, but expect to resume share repurchases as soon as possible thereafter. In fact, we expect to return more than $2 billion to shareholders in 2016 through share repurchases and dividends just from our legacy Marriott business. With the Starwood transaction, returns to shareholders could be meaningfully higher.
As we approach the integration of Marriott and Starwood, we've identified a few guiding principles. We will continue to put people first. This is our cultural touchstone because taking care of associates enables them to take care of the guests. We recognize customer service is the foundation of every lodging brand and RevPAR premiums. 
Throughout the integration process, we intend to drive results for owners and franchisees to help enhance the value of their hotel investment. For shareholders, we will continue to look for ways to leverage the scale and opportunities from this transaction to drive value beyond the base case synergies we've outlined for you, and we intend to do all of this as quickly as possible. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Laurie, we'll take questions now."

Now at the same time, obviously, Starwood is a much bigger deal than any of those were, which presents some positive differences and then some greater challenges. I think on the positive side, Starwood is hopefully less distracted by the process of the sale of the company. And you've got a big talented group of folks over there running 350,000 rooms or so. But I know the Starwood team, with our encouragement, is very much focused on continuing to drive sales and to drive the development engine. And we've taken steps to try and put our arms around those teams of folks, so that they are as little distracted by this as possible. I think some of the other deals we did early, it was that sales engine, which looked like it got distracted during a sales process and to some extent between the negotiated -- or the signing of a deal and the closing of a deal. And we're doing everything we can to plan for integration of systems and integration of business units between now and when we close, so that we can implement those as quickly as possible.

But I think we will see transient grow in about the same range. Let me just talk a little bit more about the philosophy around our RevPAR guidance of 3% to 5% for 2016, which has been noted obviously the number of early reports that have come out that that's a point lower than what we thought a quarter ago. What's changed between then and now, I think we look at a world in which there's obviously more anxiety in the marketplace. There's a bit more anxiety about what GDP growth is going to look like in 2016. And as a consequence, we've been a bit more conservative in the forecast that we've provided. When we look internally at our own sort of budgets that are rolled up by hotel, this is a U.S.-focused comment obviously, I think our expectations have maybe declined by about 0.5 point from where we've guessed they were a quarter ago. And that's why we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our expectation is sort of towards the higher end of that 3% to 5%. But there's enough uncertainty out there that we thought the 3% to 5% range is probably a more constructive place for us to be than to try and move it by only 0.5 point. It gives us a little bit more room to see what happens with GDP growth. Transient business is the hardest to predict because it does not really have much of a long lead time, particularly with business travelers. There, you're really talking about days or maybe a week or 2. Leisure tends to be a little bit longer than that. But what we see is again reasonably encouraging. The sky is not falling when we look at our data. That is profoundly the case when you look at group business, but it is also very much the case when you look at transient business. We mentioned the 2.5% transient demand in January. We look at U.S. system-wide RevPAR numbers, and they were up a hair over 3% in the month of January. And we think that probably had nearly a 1-point impact because of the blizzard on the East Coast. And so all things considered, that's not bad, and we'd expect February to be better. That's a longer answer than you asked for. But generally, we would expect transient to be a bit lower than group, but still in meaningful mid-digit, mid-single-digit range."

And there are opportunities in both of those places. So when you think about revenue synergies, they're the hardest things for us to put a number out there. We don't have one for you now. Hopefully, when we get to a point of digesting the acquisition and sharing in more detail with all of you our plans, we can be a little bit more specific about it. But the basic notion is, how do you take these 2 leading loyalty programs in the industry, Marriott Rewards and SPG, and create something which is even more powerful, and by doing that, take greater share of the business for the members of those 2 programs and drive top line revenue for the hotels that are in the system? I think when you get to the cost side, we'll find hopefully that we are less reliant on the most expensive sources of third-party business. Over time, I think we'll find that there are opportunities in procurement. I think we'll find that there are efficiencies and systems costs that can be driven in -- as a result of going to one system instead of having 2. And I think we'll find lots of opportunities to really again both drive the top line and the bottom line. So we feel really good about this. I think the only thing we hear in response to the deal that is a community that says please reassure us is rewards and SPG members want to make sure that their points are protected and that they don't have anything to fear. And we've been assuring both of those communities that the principal reason for our doing this deal is actually to redouble our commitment to them and make them feel even better about their loyalty to us so that they need not be worried.

The -- and Leeny, jump in here with your perspective. But I think the weakness in the financial markets, which does impact confidence, particularly among financial players, is making debt financing, I think, more difficult today than it was a few months ago. And as a consequence, I suspect that some of these deals, which have recently been signed, will be harder to get financed than deals that were signed maybe a year ago. And so if there's a risk here in the near term, it is that some of these deals either will get delayed to some extent or some may even be killed if debt financing cannot be made available. It's going to vary a little bit by type of owner partner or franchisee partner. I think those that are -- tend to be more in the center part of the country, more conservatively financed. More regional banks probably will continue to be less impacted by this sort of increased anxiety. I think those that are less institutional, more classically project financed as opposed to balance sheet financed, I think there's a greater risk that some of those projects may be delayed."

That piece is not surprising, obviously. We see proportionately the same sort of FX impact to our business going forward. But we'll have to digest those things. And again, this is not a deal that is based on one quarter's numbers or necessarily even one year's numbers, but a deal that we think is very attractive, both financially in the long term and strategically."

On the residential side, we definitely are now seeing kind of the -- that business has really picked up from 2013 through 2015, as you saw the residential market rebound. And so as we look out into the future, we've got a number of other projects coming on board in '17 and '18.

The -- obviously, we've been bombarded with news about the Chinese economy over the last couple of quarters, most of it not very positive in what we read in the papers here. And obviously, a big chunk of that is related to their manufacturing and export business, to some extent related to their infrastructure spending and, to some extent, to their financial markets and financial institutions. I think underneath all of that, you've got China continuing to move towards a consumer economy. You've got a growing middle class that has resources to expend on things other than bare necessities. And as a consequence, I think we see in our industry, and certainly at Marriott, a stronger performance in China than you might expect from reading that newspaper. Obviously, it is a very big market, And so the performance in different cities will vary from place to place. We had some of the numbers in our prepared remarks. Shanghai continues to be a very strong market all the way through 2015. Hong Kong by contrast has been a market which has been under pressure, in part because of the political implications of some of the street protests and other decisions that are made that derive from them. But then you look at other markets like Japan. The China visitation to Japan was up something like 25% or 30% last year, if memory serves. And it is driving great performance in our Japanese hotels, and you see that sort of growth in outbound China business continuing to perform really well. And what we see so far in 2016 continues to make us quite positive about China. Not to be sure that China New Year's has shifted from January to February, so we'll have to get through February and see exactly how the dust settles. But we're feeling pretty good about China. We're feeling pretty good about Asia. When it comes to MVW and ILG and their interest in the loyalty programs, this is a -- it's going to be a really fun set of issues to work through. Obviously, we've already talked about the strategic importance of using these loyalty programs to both grow our loyal customer base and to intensify our relationships with them. And we think SPG and Marriott Rewards give us a perfect opportunity to do that. At the same time, we have in MVW and ILG companies, which are keenly interested in making sure that they can continue to market Marriott timeshare to the Marriott Rewards folks and Starwood timeshare to the SPG folks. Similarly, we have credit card partners in those 2 programs, FedEx with -- or FedEx, Amex, excuse me, with SPG and JPMorgan Chase Visa with Marriott Rewards. And we'll work through those things with both. We don't fear either of those issues, though, and think actually that we will find a way to create great value for us and our customers as well as for those partners."

It starts with when we get to this point of the year particularly, it starts with budgets of the hotels.

So you answered part of the question yourself in terms of the reason why expenditures are down, and that is Delta. From the standpoint of when we were talking to you a year ago, we knew that we were going to be spending $130-odd million on Delta. We also knew that we had some more CapEx to finish putting into our EDITION Hotels. So that really makes up the bulk of the difference in terms of the CapEx spending. But then when you look at the amount of recycling that we did do in '15 and what that led to in terms of share repurchases, the real difference when you look into '16 is, number one, we're starting off a bit under-levered. So if you think of something like 1 point, 1.1 point on our leverage ratio, gives you the share repurchase capability of close to $200 million. And if we started off at 2.8, and our typical number is 3, right off the bat, you've got $400 million of additional share repurchase capacity without really doing anything. Then you've got a little bit -- as you spoke of, a little bit less in CapEx. And then, frankly, we are able to lever up a little bit with our growing EBITDAR, and you put those together and that gets us to our $2 billion or over $2 billion."

I mean, what our base model assumes is that over the course of the first couple of years or so, we will get the combined larger company back to sort of the 3x debt-to-EBITDA target that we've talked about for years. There are some things we still don't really know in detail, actually, a lot of things we don't know in detail. But part of this is making sure that we assess how many dollars are trapped offshore and work through the planning process to see whether they can be brought back to the U.S. and used. And we don't know how long that's going to take. Really, Starwood has work that is underway there, and we have some sense for what the options are there, but we've got a lot more work to do. And so it's a long-winded way of saying we do have some assumptions about share repurchase over the first few years in the model. As with all of our share repurchase assumption, that tends to have stock prices when we're buying back stock at sort of normal multiples and growing stock prices whether you look at the Marriott standalone model or the combined multiple. And so they are not as profound in driving EPS accretion as you might think if you sat here and said, ""Okay, well what if you buy back all the stock at today's stock price?"" for example. But we'll work through that. I think there is -- just state the obvious, the more we can convert the acquisition of Starwood to a cash deal by buying back stock sooner, particularly at the kind of values that the market is attributing to the companies today, the more we like that deal. And it becomes something which is a no-brainer attractive transaction for us. And so where we end up exactly in this, we'll have to see both what happens with the stock price, but what happens with the cash management issues that we need to get through."

One of the unknowables for us is what the tax basis is on those properties today. And my question is, what happens to that tax basis by virtue of the acquisition as we go through it? Because ultimately, that helps us estimate what the gross proceed or what the net proceeds will be on an after-tax basis."

I mean, it's in, if I remember, a 10% to 15% range of gross proceeds, something like that. There generally, though, is not an impact on tax basis from the transaction since we're acquiring the stock of the parent company. And whether those assumptions turn out to be exactly right, we'll have to see as we get further into it. You're right, though, to talk about asset sales because that will be one of the things that has a significant impact to both the amount and pace of share repurchases. I think it's -- without getting into the details, it is crystal clear that from an earnings perspective, these hotels can be sold in every instance at dramatically higher multiples than what the earnings contribution are from them. When you look at EBITDA multiples, it becomes a little bit closer. But even there, it's a great portfolio of assets that we would think in virtually all instances. And again, take this all with a little bit of grain of salt since we -- there's still a lot that we don't know. But in virtually all instances, we would think that the prices available would be at higher EBITDA multiples than the companies are trading them, which just gives us that much more conviction that we ought to continue with the strategy we've had for a number of years, which is to be focused on management and franchising and not on owning real estate."

Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
Before we get started, I'd like to thank Carl Berquist for his outstanding financial leadership over the last 14 years. During his tenure as CFO at Marriott, we announced the Starwood deal, acquired AC Hotels, Gaylord, Protea and Delta, and created considerable value by spinning off our timeshare business. Further, he bought back nearly 150 million shares of stock at an average price of $47. He brought us through the tough times in 2009 and 2010. And like many of you, Carl remains a Marriott shareholder. Thank you, Carl, for everything.
I'd also like to welcome Leeny Oberg to the CFO position. Also a great leader, Leeny brings a wealth of Marriott experience, including project finance, international finance, corporate financial planning and most recently, CFO of our Ritz-Carlton organization. She started her career in banking and her Marriott carrier in Investor Relations, so I know she well understand the street.
As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. 
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 18, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
To begin, the biggest Marriott news in 2015 was our announced acquisition of Starwood. The transaction is on track, and we expect to close around midyear 2016. The S-4 went effective yesterday. We expect the proxy solicitation will be mailed to shareholders of both companies on or about February 19 to stockholders of record as of February 2. And special shareholders meetings for both Marriott and Starwood are scheduled for March 28. 
We are seeking government approval for the transaction in multiple jurisdictions. Starwood's timeshare spinoff and merger with ILG is proceeding on schedule, and we do not expect this transaction to delay our acquisition of Starwood. 
While we are on track, Marriott and Starwood are still separate public companies and are limited in the information we may share with each other and you. So our discussions today about RevPAR, booking pace, pipeline, unit growth, EPS guidance and so forth are for the Marriott business only and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition. Like you, we eagerly await this afternoon's comments from Starwood about their business trends.
So let's get started. Attendance at the ALIS Conference in LA of this year was a bit late due to the deluge of East Coast snow. But there was still a lot of conversation at the conference. And the #1 topic was the disconnect between stock performance and hotel fundamentals. 
Let's start with 2 facts about this business. First, it is cyclical, with demand highly correlated to GDP growth, capital investment and the employment. Second, it has seasonality and can be sensitive to holidays, group bookings and special events. In any given quarter, it's sometimes difficult to see which of these aspects of the business are most impactful. 
This was true in the fourth quarter. System-wide North America RevPAR grew 5% in October, roughly 4% in November and just under 3% in December. We believe it was the modest growth in GDP in the fourth quarter that constrained our transient business, particularly premium-rated business. As we typically have little group business during the holiday season, we turned to price-sensitive travelers, opening discounts for AAA members, seniors and others. As a result, our fourth quarter occupancy still reached near-record levels, although room rates were modestly weaker than anticipated.
Other factors also came into play. In Houston, system-wide RevPAR declined 8% in the quarter, reflecting weakness in the energy sector. While occupancy in our New York hotels remained very strong at 88%, our RevPAR growth in New York declined 1% as new supply constrained pricing. In San Francisco, RevPAR growth moderated from earlier in the year, rising only 6% in the quarter, as high prices detoured guests to more affordable destinations like Los Angeles, where our RevPAR saw a double-digit increase. 
Make no mistake, business travelers are on the road. While the energy and manufacturing sectors were weak in the quarter, we saw significant strength in technology, professional services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, automotive and media. In fact, room sales from our nearly 300 largest corporate customers increased 4% in the fourth quarter, 7% excluding energy and manufacturing companies.
And near-term transient trends in North America are improving. System-wide, total transient revenue increased roughly 2% in December and nearly 2.5% in a very snowy January. For February, transient revenue on the books is up nearly 4% to date. For the full year, our special corporate customers tell us they expect to travel at least as much in 2016 as in 2015. And with special corporate negotiations nearly complete, we expect special corporate pricing to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016. 
Group business is even stronger. North American group revenue in the fourth quarter increased 6% and attendance at meetings exceeded expectations. Catering revenue also increased 6%, with considerable last-minute food and beverage upgrades. New group business booked in the fourth quarter for any period in the future increased 10% year-over-year. 
Group revenue booking pace for the first quarter of 2016 is up 2%, reflecting the shift in timing of Easter year-over-year. Not surprisingly, the second quarter is much stronger, with revenue pace up 9%. For the full year 2016, group revenue booking pace is up 7%. Incidentally, with very high occupancy rates and limited hotel meeting space, groups are booking earlier. Group revenue booking pace for 2017 is up 8%, while 2018 is up 9%.
So what does this mean for RevPAR guidance? With the tough Easter comparison, we expect 2% to 4% RevPAR growth in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect North American RevPAR growth at the upper end of 3% to 5%. Our full year outlook is tempered a bit from our October view due to incremental weakness in the energy and manufacturing sectors and a modestly lower GDP growth assumption for 2016. 
Elsewhere in the world, economies in Italy and Spain are recovering nicely, while German economic growth has cooled with fewer exports to China. Despite Russia's ongoing recession, we saw higher domestic demand in our hotels in Moscow in the fourth quarter. 
Security concerns continue to weigh on demand in Paris and Brussels and, to a lesser extent, in London. In 2015, Europe represented 7% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect Europe's RevPAR to increase at a low single-digit rate. 
In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR declined in the fourth quarter due to security concerns, low oil prices and Dubai oversupply. For 2016, we are modeling low single-digit RevPAR growth. As expected, infrastructure investment in UAE and Qatar, economic growth in Africa and easing comparison in Egypt should improve results late in the year. In 2015, the Middle East and Africa represented 3% of our worldwide fee revenue.
In the Asia Pacific region, China's economic growth moderated in 2015, yet Mainland China RevPAR still rose roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. Chinese consumers continue to spend. In fact, international travel from Mainland China to our hotels in other markets increased 31%. 
In India, the improving economy drove RevPAR up 12%. In 2015, the Asia Pacific region accounted for 8% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect the Asia Pacific region will continue to grow RevPAR at a mid-single-digit rate, with continued strength in India, Japan and Thailand.
In the Caribbean and Latin America region, solid economic growth in Mexico is driving both RevPAR and hotel expansion, while the Caribbean remains an attractive venue for groups and an appealing warm weather playground for tourists, particularly after they dig out from under 2 feet of snow. 
We've seen a few cancellations due to the Zika virus and are watching this carefully. Hotels in affected areas are fogging outdoor areas, providing mosquito repellent for guests and dealing with areas of standing water. While Brazil remains in recession, we are hopeful that the Summer Olympics will lift RevPAR in that market in 2016. 
For the full year, we expect RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2015, the region accounted for 4% of our worldwide fee revenue. All in all, we believe our worldwide system-wide RevPAR will grow at 3% to 5% for the year. 
Our system grew by nearly 52,000 rooms in 2015, 11,000 in the fourth quarter alone, taking our system to nearly 760,000 rooms worldwide. New owner and franchisee signings in 2015 reached a record 104,000 rooms, taking our development pipeline to more than 270,000 rooms, another new high. Our brands continue to be preferred by hotel developers. According to STR, at year-end 2015, 27% of hotels under construction in North America were affiliated with one of Marriott brands, more than any other hotel company.
Outside North America, in recent years, we've enhanced growth and increased speed to market by decentralizing decision-making, tailoring brands to local market tastes and building relationships with local partners to drive development. This has really made a difference to our limited-service brands. 
In fact, in the past 5 years, our limited-service portfolio outside North America has more than tripled to 316 hotels, with another 250 hotels in the development pipeline. Consistent with this strategy, yesterday, we announced a long-term agreement with Eastern Crown Hotels Group for development of Fairfield hotels in China. 
Demand for economy tier lodging has grown rapidly in China in a relatively short period of time, as the middle class has rapidly expanded. Eastern Crown is targeting 140 signed deals over 5 years, including 100 Fairfield hotels expected to open by 2021. 
Worldwide, with our strong brands and deep development pipeline, in 2016, we expect our rooms will increase by roughly 7%, net of deletions. While not included in our growth targets, nevertheless, we expect our worldwide system will take a significant leap forward with the completion of the Starwood acquisition. This transaction will expand our presence around the world, broaden our appeal to younger travelers and increase the growth opportunities for Starwood's valuable brands. 
In addition, the combination of Starwood's leading lifestyle brands with Marriott's strong presence across the select-service and luxury tiers, as well as our convention and resort segment, will create a very attractive portfolio that should be more appealing to guests and meeting planners, and thus, more appealing to owners and franchisees as well. 
We believe the transaction offers meaningful opportunities for shareholders, hotel owners and hotel franchisees through enhanced growth and improved efficiency. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's brands by leveraging our hotel development expertise and strong relationships. We continue to estimate that we will achieve annual run rate synergies of at least $200 million by the second full year after closing. 
Excluding transition and transaction costs, we continue to expect the transaction will be EPS-accretive in the second full year after closing. We know you have many questions about our brand strategies, integration plans and specific efficiency opportunities. We don't have answers for you today and ask for your patience as we work through these decisions and plans. We believe this transaction will create substantial value for Marriott and Starwood shareholders and look forward to working aggressively towards its completion. 
In Marriott's history, there have been a few profound decisions that changed the company's course and launched us to greater success. In 1979, we sold our first portfolio of owned hotels and became hotel managers. In 1993, we created Host Hotels, further reducing our real estate focus and stepping up franchising. We became a pure-play lodging company just 5 years ago with the spinoff of our timeshare business. 
We believe this acquisition is as significant. It will make us the largest hotel company in the world, focused solely on management and franchising, with a very strong portfolio of great brands, powerful loyalty programs and terrific prospects for the future. Now to provide more information about the fourth quarter and our 2016 outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny?"

2015 was a great year. Worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 5% on a constant dollar basis. Total fee revenue reached $1.9 billion, constrained by about $32 million of foreign exchange. Incentive fees in North America increased 18%, largely due to strong performance at our limited-service hotels in our California and Florida resorts. 
For the full year 2015, the percentage of North American hotels paying incentive fees increased from 36% to 63%. The increase in the number of hotels paying fees was largely due to 3 portfolios of limited-service hotels that earned $7 million in incentive fees in the full year 2015 and are expected to earn higher incentive fee amounts in 2016. 
Incentive fees from our international hotels declined during the year, primarily due to $15 million of foreign exchange headwind. In the fourth quarter, worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 4% on a constant dollar basis and 2% on an actual dollar basis. Total fee revenue in the quarter increased 6%, constrained by $12 million of foreign exchange. 
Our hotels did an outstanding job in the fourth quarter as they focused on the bottom line. House profit margins at company-operated hotels increased 90 basis points in North America and 70 basis points worldwide. House profit per available room rose faster than RevPAR, up 9% in North America and 7% worldwide. 
Fourth quarter incentive fees in North America increased 20% to $33 million, with particular strength in full-service hotels in Florida and Washington, D.C. Incentive fees in international markets declined 12% in the quarter, reflecting tough foreign exchange comparisons and a few weak markets in the Middle East and Latin America. 
Owned, leased and other revenue declined 7% in the quarter, largely due to weaker revenue growth at a hotel under renovation and unfavorable foreign exchange. Net of expenses, Owned, leased and other increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to higher termination fees and lower preopening expenses. 
General and administrative expenses increased 4% in the quarter, reflecting $5 million in transaction costs associated with the Starwood acquisition and higher net hotel development costs. We received $62 million in cash in the fourth quarter for our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton Hotel. For the full year 2015, we recycled nearly $950 million from asset sales, investment redemptions and note collections. Our fourth quarter tax rate was lower than expected, largely due to the St. Thomas transaction and a favorable IRS settlement. We expect our book tax rate to be roughly 32.3% in 2016.
In the first quarter of 2016, our 2% to 4% expected RevPAR growth and continued unit expansion should yield $475 million to $485 million in fee revenue. We are expecting $13 million in lower relicensing fees for the quarter versus last year. 
Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, should be flattish in the first quarter due to tough comparisons to last year. As I mentioned, we recently sold the St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton. As an owned hotel, in its seasonally strong first quarter of 2015, the property earned nearly $6 million. 
First quarter G&A should total roughly $160 million. We still have a tough comparison to $13 million in favorable litigation settlements in the prior year. Our G&A estimate does not include Starwood acquisition-related expenses. All in all, we expect EPS for the first quarter will total $0.81 to $0.85.
For the full year, with 3% to 5% worldwide RevPAR growth and roughly 7% net unit growth, we expect fee revenue will increase 7% to 9% to reach roughly $2 billion. We expect roughly $30 million negative FX impact on year-over-year fee revenue growth in 2016. Even including FX impact, we expect incentive fees will increase at a 10% to 15% growth rate with continued strength in North America. 
We expect full year Owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, will increase roughly 20%, reflecting the impact of completed hotel renovations and higher branding fees from residential sales as several projects should begin sales during the year. Further, we expect higher credit card branding fees, with growth in new accounts and cardholder sales. We expect general and administrative costs will increase 3% to 4% in 2016, a 3% to 4% decline on a per room basis.
Net interest expense should increase to roughly $160 million, reflecting both higher borrowings and higher interest income. All combined, we expect 2016 fully diluted EPS will total $3.69 to $3.86, an increase of 17% to 23%. Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 should grow 10% to 14%.
We understand there are a variety of opinions about likely economic growth. Our 2016 outlook assumes roughly 2.5% growth in U.S. GDP. For those of you with more bearish economic views, we believe that flat U.S. GDP would still likely yield roughly 2% RevPAR growth at our hotels in North America, given today's supply environment. Given our significant management and franchise business, we expect this scenario would still yield mid-teens 2016 EPS growth and high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.
Remember, our guidance excludes the pending Starwood acquisition. We expect the P&L impact of Starwood will be very noisy in 2016 due to the transition and transaction costs. We will provide more information about the transaction during the second quarter earnings call.
Investment spending in 2016 should total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance CapEx spending. With few owned assets remaining, we expect asset sales and loan repayments will total roughly $200 million to $250 million. 
Our business strategy enables us to grow rapidly in a strong market and continue to deliver attractive returns in a weaker one. Compared to 2007, today, we have 40% more rooms in our system worldwide. Our development pipeline is deeper. Our cash flow is less volatile. We are out of the timeshare business. And while we still earn attractive incentive fees, those fees represented only 17% of fee revenue in 2015 compared to 26% in 2007. 
Today, we estimate that a 1-point change in our RevPAR outlook across our system for the full year 2016, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $25 million in fees and roughly $3 million of Owned, leased and other net. Even after completion of the Starwood transaction, we intend to remain a solid investment grade company with strong access to capital markets. We will be out of the market until after the special shareholders meetings, but expect to resume share repurchases as soon as possible thereafter. In fact, we expect to return more than $2 billion to shareholders in 2016 through share repurchases and dividends just from our legacy Marriott business. With the Starwood transaction, returns to shareholders could be meaningfully higher.
As we approach the integration of Marriott and Starwood, we've identified a few guiding principles. We will continue to put people first. This is our cultural touchstone because taking care of associates enables them to take care of the guests. We recognize customer service is the foundation of every lodging brand and RevPAR premiums. 
Throughout the integration process, we intend to drive results for owners and franchisees to help enhance the value of their hotel investment. For shareholders, we will continue to look for ways to leverage the scale and opportunities from this transaction to drive value beyond the base case synergies we've outlined for you, and we intend to do all of this as quickly as possible. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Laurie, we'll take questions now."

Now at the same time, obviously, Starwood is a much bigger deal than any of those were, which presents some positive differences and then some greater challenges. I think on the positive side, Starwood is hopefully less distracted by the process of the sale of the company. You've got a big talented group of folks over there running 350,000 rooms or so. But I know the Starwood team, with our encouragement, is very much focused on continuing to drive sales and to drive the development engine. And we've taken steps to try and put our arms around those teams of folks, so that they are as little distracted by this as possible. I think some of the other deals we did early, it was that sales engine, which looked like it got distracted during a sales process and to some extent between the -- or the signing of a deal and the closing of a deal. And we're doing everything we can to plan for integration of systems and integration of business units between now and when we close, so that we can implement those as quickly as possible. And we're optimistic at this point that this will go well."

But then you get to some places like e-mail systems or the like, which are very identical, but other systems which are unique and have been custom developed by each of Starwood and Marriott. Generally, our plan is as quickly as feasible to move to one system, not two. By doing that, we think we will provide efficiencies to our hotel owners and franchisees. We'll provide ease of operation, and we should free up resources to invest in a loyalty program system and some other things, which are much more strategically important."

But I think we will see transient grow in about the same range. Let me just talk a little bit more about the philosophy around our RevPAR guidance of 3% to 5% for 2016; which has been noted obviously the number of early reports that have come out that that's a point lower than what we thought a quarter ago. What's changed between then and now, I think we look at a world in which there's obviously more anxiety in the marketplace. There's a bit more anxiety about what GDP growth is going to look like in 2016. And as a consequence, we've been a bit more conservative in the forecast that we've provided. When we look internally at our own sort of budgets that are rolled up by hotel, this is a U.S.-focused comment obviously, I think our expectations have maybe declined by about 0.5 point from where we guessed they were a quarter ago. And that's why we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our expectation is sort of towards the higher end of that 3% to 5%. But there's enough uncertainty out there that we thought the 3% to 5% range is probably a more constructive place for us to be than to try and move it by only 0.5 point. It gives us a little bit more room to see what happens with GDP growth. Transient business is the hardest to predict because it does not really have much of a long lead time, particularly with business travelers. There, you're really talking about days or maybe a week or 2. Leisure tends to be a little bit longer than that. But what we see is again reasonably encouraging. The sky is not falling when we look at our data. That is profoundly the case when you look at Group business, but it is also very much the case when you look at Transient business. We mentioned the 2.5% transient demand in January. We look at U.S. system-wide RevPAR numbers, and they were up a hair over 3% in the month of January. And we think that probably had nearly a 1-point impact because of the blizzard on the East Coast. And so all things considered, that's not bad, and we'd expect February to be better. That's a longer answer than you asked for. But generally, we would expect transient to be a bit lower than group, but still in meaningful mid-digit, mid-single-digit range."

And there are opportunities in both of those places. So when you think about revenue synergies, and they're the hardest things for us to put a number out there. We don't have one for you now. Hopefully, when we get to a point of digesting the acquisition and sharing in more detail with all of you our plans, we can be a little bit more specific about it. But the basic notion is, how do you take these 2 leading loyalty programs in the industry, Marriott Rewards and SPG, and create something which is even more powerful, and by doing that, take greater share of the business for the members of those two programs and drive top line revenue for the hotels that are in the system? I think when you get to the cost side, we'll find hopefully that we are less reliant on the most expensive sources of third-party business. Over time, I think we'll find that there are opportunities in procurement. I think we'll find that there are efficiencies and systems costs that can be driven in -- as a result of going to one system instead of having two. And I think we'll find lots of opportunities to really again both drive the top line and the bottom line. So we feel really good about this. I think the only thing we hear in response to the deal that is a community that says please reassure us is rewards and SPG members want to make sure that their points are protected and that they don't have anything to fear.

The -- and Leeny, jump in here with your perspective. But I think the weakness in the financial markets, which does impact confidence, particularly among financial players, is making debt financing, I think, more difficult today than it was a few months ago. And as a consequence, I suspect that some of these deals, which have recently been signed, will be harder to get financed than deals that were signed maybe a year ago. And so if there's a risk here in the near term, it is that some of these deals either will get delayed to some extent or some may even be killed if debt financing cannot be made available. It's going to vary a little bit by type of owner partner or franchisee partner. I think those that are -- tend to be more in the center part of the country, more conservatively financed, more regional banks probably will continue to be less impacted by this sort of increased anxiety. I think those that are less institutional, more classically project financed as opposed to balance sheet financed, I think there's a greater risk that some of those projects may be delayed."

On the residential side, we definitely are now seeing kind of the -- that business has really picked up from 2013 through 2015, as you saw the residential market rebound. And so as we look out into the future, we've got a number of other projects coming on board in '17 and '18.

The -- obviously, we've been bombarded with news about the Chinese economy over the last couple of quarters, most of it not very positive in what we read in the papers here. And obviously, a big chunk of that is related to their manufacturing and export business, to some extent it's related to their infrastructure spending and, to some extent, to their financial markets and financial institutions. I think underneath all of that, you've got China continuing to move towards a consumer economy. You've got a growing middle class that has resources to expend on things other than bare necessities. And as a consequence, I think we see in our industry, and certainly at Marriott, a stronger performance in China than you might expect from reading that newspaper. Obviously, it is a very big market. And so the performance in different cities will vary from place to place. We had some of the numbers in our prepared remarks. Shanghai continues to be a very strong market all the way through 2015. Hong Kong by contrast has been a market which has been under pressure, in part because of the political implications of some of the street protests and other decisions that are made that derive from them. But then you look at other markets like Japan; China visitation to Japan was up something like 25% or 30% last year, if memory serves. And it is driving great performance in our Japanese hotels, and you see that sort of growth in outbound China business continuing to perform really well. And what we see so far in 2016 continues to make us quite positive about China. Now to be sure the China New Year's has shifted from January to February, so we'll have to get through February and see exactly how the dust settles. But we're feeling pretty good about China. We're feeling pretty good about Asia. When it comes to MVW and ILG and their interest in the loyalty programs, this is a -- it's going to be a really fun set of issues to work through. Obviously, we've already talked about the strategic importance of using these loyalty programs to both grow our loyal customer base and to intensify our relationships with them. And we think SPG and Marriott Rewards give us a perfect opportunity to do that. At the same time, we have in MVW and ILG companies, which are keenly interested in making sure that they can continue to market Marriott timeshare to the Marriott Rewards folks and Starwood timeshare to the SPG folks. Similarly, we have credit card partners in those two programs, FedEx with -- or FedEx, Amex, excuse me, with SPG and JPMorgan Chase Visa with Marriott Rewards. And we'll work through those things with both. We don't fear either of those issues, though, and think actually that we will find a way to create great value for us and our customers as well as for those partners."

It starts with when we get to this point of the year particularly, it starts with budgets at the hotels. And they're looking at some supply trends, but essentially much more demand trends in their market.

So you answered part of the question yourself in terms of the reason why expenditures are down, and that is Delta. From the standpoint of when we were talking to you a year ago, we knew that we were going to be spending $130-odd million on Delta. We also knew that we had some more CapEx to finish putting into our EDITION Hotels. So that really makes up the bulk of the difference in terms of the CapEx spending. But then when you look at the amount of recycling that we did do in '15 and what that led to in terms of share repurchases, the real difference when you look into '16 is, number one, we're starting off a bit under-levered. So if you think of something like 1 point, 1.1 point on our leverage ratio, gives you the share repurchase capability of close to $200 million. And if we started off at 2.8, and our typical number is 3, right off the bat, you've got $400 million of additional share repurchase capacity without really doing anything. Then you've got a little bit -- as you spoke of, a little bit less in CapEx. And then, frankly, we are able to lever up a little bit with our growing EBITDAR, and you put those together and that gets us to our $2 billion or over $2 billion."

I mean, what our base model assumes is that over the course of the first couple of years or so, we will get the combined larger company back to sort of the 3x debt-to-EBITDA target that we've talked about for years. There are some things we still don't really know in detail, actually, a lot of things we don't know in detail. But part of this is making sure that we assess how many dollars are trapped offshore and work through the planning process to see whether they can be brought back to the U.S. and used. And we don't know how long that's going to take. Really, Starwood has work that is underway there, and we have some sense for what the options are there, but we've got a lot more work to do. And so it's a long-winded way of saying we do have some assumptions about share repurchase over the first few years in the model. As with all of our share repurchase assumption, that tends to have stock prices when we buy back stock at sort of normal multiples and growing stock prices whether you look at the Marriott standalone model or the combined multiple. And so they are not as profound in driving EPS accretion as you might think if you sat here and said, ""Okay, well what if you buy back all the stock at today's stock price?"" for example. But we'll work through that. I think there is -- just state the obvious, the more we can convert the acquisition of Starwood to a cash deal by buying back stock sooner, particularly at the kind of values that the market is attributing to the companies today, the more we like that deal. And it becomes something which is a no-brainer attractive transaction for us. And so where we end up exactly in this, we'll have to see both what happens with the stock price, but what happens with the cash management issues that we need to get through."

And while we can perhaps make some assumptions around what those properties earn and what would be a fair multiple, and we can -- I think we've talked about, on the call, the questions around who the buyers are and their ability to pay. One of the unknowables for us is what the tax basis is on those properties today. And my question is, what happens to that tax basis by virtue of the acquisition as we go through it? Because ultimately, that helps us estimate what the gross -- what the net proceeds will be on an after-tax basis."

I mean, it's in, if I remember, a 10% to 15% range of gross proceeds, something like that. There generally, though, is not an impact on tax basis from the transaction since we're acquiring the stock of the parent company. And whether those assumptions turn out to be exactly right, we'll have to see as we get further into it. You're right, though, to talk about asset sales because that will be one of the things that has a significant impact to both the amount and pace of share repurchases. I think it's -- without getting into the details, it is crystal clear that from an earnings perspective, these hotels can be sold in every instance at dramatically higher multiples than what the earnings contribution are from them. When you look at EBITDA multiples, it becomes a little bit closer. But even there, it's a great portfolio of assets that we would think in virtually all instances. And again, take this all with a little bit of grain of salt since we -- there's still a lot that we don't know. But in virtually all instances, we would think that the prices available would be at higher EBITDA multiples than the companies are trading at; which just gives us that much more conviction that we ought to continue with the strategy we've had for a number of years; which is to be focused on management and franchising and not on owning real estate."

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lenny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
First, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 28, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. 
So let's talk about the first quarter. In North America, comparable systemwide RevPAR rose 2.4% in the quarter. In January, North America systemwide RevPAR rose 3.1% despite the severe East Coast snowstorm. In February, RevPAR rose 3.4%. But March RevPAR increased only 1% as group meeting planners avoided the week before and the week after Easter. All in all, we estimate the shift in Easter holiday period reduced our systemwide RevPAR growth by about 1 percentage point for the quarter. 
A natural first question would be, why, with 2.4% North America systemwide RevPAR growth in Q1, do we think 3% to 5% growth is still the right range for the year? Strong group business on the books gives us confidence in the remainder of the year, including higher transient room rates that are likely to come with stronger group compression in the second and third quarters. In fact, April RevPAR through the 23rd is up 5.2%. Group booking pays [ph] for our full-service hotels in North America is up 7% for the rest of the year.
First quarter RevPAR growth was strongest in Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the California desert, while RevPAR in Chicago and Philadelphia declined due to unfavorable citywide calendars. 
Systemwide RevPAR at our limited-service hotels rose 2% in the quarter, constrained by a combination of weak demand from the oil and gas industries and new upscale supply. RevPAR at Ritz-Carlton increased more than 6% as recently completed renovations pushed both occupancy and room rates higher and the earlier Easter increased leisure business, particularly in Lake Tahoe and [indiscernible] where the snow was deep and the skiing was great. 
STR expects overall U.S. supply growth of 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Interestingly, in the last 6 months, financing for new hotel construction in the U.S. has become more conservative. We understand that leverage levels on new construction loans have declined from 70% to 75% a year ago to 60% to 65% today. Loan pricing and recourse levels have increased. In certain markets, construction costs are also higher, particularly labor. While we aren't likely to see a material change in supply growth in the near term, longer-term we believe these conditions should discourage marginal new projects from going forward and could delay others.
While new industry construction could moderate in the U.S. over time, we believe our brand conversions will likely accelerate. Our Autograph brand reached 100 hotels worldwide in just 6 years, largely due to conversions. With 19 brands today and soon to be 30 brands, we now have even more opportunities for meaningful unit growth through conversions.
Elsewhere in the world, in the Caribbean and Latin America, the good news was Mexico, where RevPAR rose nearly 30% in the first quarter. This expanding economy offers great opportunities for limited-service development, along with very strong RevPAR growth. Our warm-weather resorts benefited from the shift in Easter in the first quarter, but concerns about the Zika virus triggered group cancellations in some markets in the region. 
In Europe, the economy grew modestly in the first quarter and systemwide RevPAR rose nearly 3%. The tragic events in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul depressed occupancy rates in those markets with some spillover concern impacting RevPAR results in London as well. Elsewhere in the U.K., RevPAR remained very strong. In Spain, the economy is rapidly recovering, and our hotels benefited from strong demand from U.K. and U.S. travelers. Instability in the Middle East and North Africa further enhanced Spain's appeal as the vacation destination. Demand for our German hotels remained strong in the quarter, with favorable payer business in Cologne and Berlin.
In the Middle East, geopolitical unrest and low oil prices depressed oil results in much of the region. While UAE occupancies remained over 80%, room rates were lower with new supply in the market. For each, there were fewer flights to the Red Sea resorts, while in Saudi Arabia hotel demand was constrained by lower government spending. Looking ahead, Ramadan will start in early June this year, about 2 weeks earlier than last year, which should hurt second quarter RevPAR comparisons in the Middle East.
In Africa, our Protea hotels performed very well, helped by strong local business and international tourism, attracted by the weak South African rand. Protea systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose nearly 15% in the first quarter, and we expect it will increase at a high single-digit rate for the full year.
Our Asia-Pacific region performed better than expected in the first quarter, while economic growth in China has moderated, consumer spending on travel remained strong. Shanghai and Beijing had very strong results in the quarter, with RevPAR up in the high single digits. Nearly 60% of mainland China hotel demand comes from mainland Chinese travelers and their numbers are growing. In the first quarter, the number of domestic Chinese travelers visiting our hotels in that market increased 7%, while the number of mainland Chinese travelers visiting our hotels abroad increased 25%. Thailand and Japan were particular beneficiaries. Hong Kong continue to see weak mainland China demand due to its strong currency [indiscernible] the U.S. dollar. In India, the economy is strengthening, and first quarter RevPAR was up 14%.
We see significant development opportunities outside North America, particularly for limited-service hotels. Today, our international limited-service development pipeline totals nearly 250 hotels with more than 47,000 rooms, a 30% increase from the last year. In Europe, after adding manpower to our development effort in recent years, we already have 70 limited-service hotels in our development pipeline, including more than 40 Moxy and AC Hotels. In India, 1/2 of our existing properties and 60% of our pipeline hotels are in the limited-service brands. In China, we recently signed the deal with Eastern Crown to launch Fairfield by Marriott. While none are yet in the pipeline, we expect to have 140 Fairfields signed in 5 years and 100 hotels opened by 2021. In Mexico, we already have 20 limited-service hotels open and another 16 in the development pipeline. Finally, in the Middle East, our limited-service hotels, Courtyard, Fairfield, Residence Inn and Protea represent 40% of our pipeline in that region.
Our unit growth is strong around the world. Excluding Starwood, we expect our worldwide rooms distribution to grow by 8% growth or 7% net in 2016. Based on STR industry pipeline data, 1 in 4 hotels under construction in the U.S. today will fly one of our flags. And worldwide, 1 in 7 hotels under construction will be flagged with Marriott brand. We are already the biggest hotel company in the world when measured by total rooms open. We signed over 100,000 rooms in both 2014 and 2015. Those signings give us great confidence in our openings in the years ahead.
With our Starwood acquisition, we will become a more global company, able to better leverage global trends and seize opportunities. Following the acquisition, we estimate more than 1/3 of our rooms and fees will come from outside the U.S. We've talked a lot about the synergies in this transaction and the economies of scale that are inherent in this business. From G&A to reservations to the Frequent Traveler program to the back of the house, we expect to recognize meaningful top line and bottom line improvements over time. And unit growth should benefit as well. With a broader brand portfolio, we will be able to offer the right brand for each asset and market. This means we can play in more sandboxes than many of our competitors, winning the highest value opportunities. We still expect the Starwood transaction will close midyear 2016. We are awaiting regulatory approvals from the EU, China, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. In the meantime, we continue to do the blocking and tackling to drive results and improve our business. 
In March, we introduced Marriott Reward Member Rates, designed to reward loyalty members who book direct. The list of member-only perks continues to grow. Loyalty points, mobile check-in and checkout, free WiFi and, now, lower rates. Today, 65% of transient room nights come from rewards members. 
This month, we announced enhancements to the rewards part of Marriott Rewards, offering a wide array of curated special events and opportunities. In addition, an initial group of elite members will be invited to participate in a new elite concierge service. By developing a relationship with a member, the concierge will be able to anticipate their unique needs, ensuring the members' preferences are recognized and their desires are met before, during and after their stay. 
And for Gold and Platinum Elites, guaranteed late checkout should make traveling both more pleasurable and more productive. 
Marriott's competitive advantages are numerous, strong brands, widespread distribution, powerful sales channels, loyalty program and reservation systems, house efficiencies, owner and franchisee preference and, most important, a culture focused on our people. But we also know that success is never final, so we are working to be even better. 
Now let me turn things over to Leeny for more about the quarter. Leeny?"
31148,328984934,965703,"Marriott International, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Marriott International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations.

For the first quarter of 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations. Results on our owned, leased and other line contributed about $0.05 of outperformance, including $0.03 from branding fees from residential real estate and our Marriott Rewards credit card, and the balance largely coming from performance of our owned and leased hotels. 
Adjusted general and administrative costs were better than expected by about $0.01, mainly due to open associate condition. Interest and taxes were about $0.02 unfavorable, largely due to some discrete tax items in the quarter. All in all, it was a solid quarter.
Total fee revenue increased 5%. As you know, 2016 is a leap year. The extra day in the quarter did not impact our RevPAR statistics, but we estimated added about 1% to our property level revenue and fee growth in the quarter. Base fees rose 4%, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth, offset by more than $4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Incentive fees increased 13%, reflecting roughly $3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a $2 million favorable recognition of deferred incentive fee. Worldwide, 63% of managed hotels earned an incentive fee in the quarter compared to 48% in the year-ago quarter. In North America, incentive fees rose 23%, with incentive fees for our limited-service brands up 40% alone.
Franchise fees were flat year-over-year. Strong unit growth and RevPAR improvement were offset by $15 million of lower relicensing fees and $2 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $81 million in the quarter, 29% higher than the prior year, largely driven by higher branding fees associated with sales of Ritz-Carlton Residences and our cobranded credit card. Our leased hotels in Tokyo and [indiscernible] showed much better results as they came out of renovation, but those results were offset by foregone owned profit from our Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas hotel, which became a company-managed property late last year.
Adjusted general and administrative expenses increased by $10 million, largely reflecting routine cost increases. This quarter, we benefited from $10 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding, while the 2015 quarter benefited from $12 million associated with favorable litigation resolution. 
We repurchased nearly 4 million shares during the quarter for approximately $225 million. We expect to complete the Starwood acquisition midyear and expect to resume share repurchases in late 2016 once our leverage ratios return to targeted levels.
For our second quarter, our guidance assumes the Starwood transaction will close some time after June 30. For Marriott's legacy business, we expect second quarter North American systemwide RevPAR will increased 3% to 5%, reflecting strong group business already on the books. We expect international systemwide RevPAR will increase 2% to 4%, reflecting strong Asia-Pacific trends, offset by weak RevPAR in the Middle East. We expect Marriott's fee revenue will increase 6% to 8% in the second quarter.
We expect our owned, leased and other results in the second quarter will increase roughly 25%, with continued strong branding fee, lower preopening expenses and higher profits from our owned and leased hotels. We expect G&A will increase 2% to 5%. Adjusted net interest expense should total roughly $40 million. All in all, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA will total $495 million to $510 million, an increase of 8% to 12%. Adjusted EPS should total $0.96 to $1, an increase of 10% to 15% year-over-year. This forecast assumes no share repurchase during the quarter and doesn't include Starwood transition and transaction costs.
Turning to the full year. We expect worldwide RevPAR for Marriott's legacy business will increase 3% to 5%. Combined with 7% net rooms growth, we expect our 2016 fee revenue will total roughly $2 billion, consistent with our forecast in February. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should total $310 million to $315 million, about $10 million ahead of our February forecast, largely due to stronger residential branding fees. We expect our full year adjusted general and administrative expenses will total $645 million to $655 million, about $5 million better than our last forecast, largely due to the open associate positions we mentioned about Q1. 
For the Marriott legacy business, 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. Excluding Starwood, we expect to recycle roughly $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments through 2016. 
Making an EPS projection for the full year 2016 is difficult given the uncertain timing of the Starwood transaction. To assist your modelers, however, for full year 2016, we expect Marriott standalone adjusted EBITDA will total $1.9 billion to $1.965 billion, about $15 million better than our February forecast. Given that 2016 transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we aren't including these costs in our guidance but rather expect to break out such expenses as actual results are recognized, as we did this quarter. When the transaction closes, we estimate we will issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increase total debt by roughly $3.5 billion, representing an estimated $20 million in higher net interest cost per quarter. Incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction will depend on purchase price accounting valuations that have not yet been completed. In the recent 8-K, we estimated incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction at roughly $52 million per quarter. Like you, we will rely on Starwood's forecast of their RevPAR growth, unit growth, asset sale assumption and adjusted EBITDA for their business. We eagerly await their first quarter results and 2016 outlook.
Our results in 2016 are likely to be messy, including Starwood, by the end of this year, we expect to be back to our targeted leverage range and to have resumed share repurchases. We expect most of the corporate level cost synergies associated with the transaction to be in place by the beginning of 2017. We are committed to completing asset sales promptly. 
Including Starwood, we could see continued strong unit growth in 2017, even with our larger size. Also, we continue to believe the transaction will be earnings per share neutral in 2017 before including the benefit of the possible revenue synergies. 
We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] We'll take questions now."

I'm also going to give you a sort of general answer to the question you haven't asked, but I think it's top of mind for everybody. We think it's about as we said in the prepared remarks, we think the negative RevPAR impact was about 1 point in Q1 to the shift of Easter. The impact to Q2 could be about the same. Obviously, the impact to 1 month of April would be larger and it could be nearly 2%. Important to keep in mind though that, last week, and April still has passed over, and so we'll look at the impact when the dust ultimately settles and give you more precise calculation. But it would be something close to 2% we would think for April. When we look at our group bookings, which of course are the clearest long-term data we have, we see April and June relatively better than May. But we see good group for Q2 as a whole. We see good group for Q3 as a whole. Q4, okay, but not quite as good as Q2 and Q3. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've got about a 7% increased group revenue on the books for Q2 through Q4 compared to the same time last year. The biggest question at the moment, obviously, is not so much about group, but it's about the strength of transient demand. And so let's start with the basics. Transect demand correlates most closely with GDP growth. Statistics out this morning show that U.S. Q1 GDP growth was only 0.5%, anemic even in the context of the fairly moderate U.S. economic recovery we've been witnessing the last few years. The question for all of us, including for you, is do we expect the U.S. economy to perform at higher growth rates in the quarters ahead? We do. It seems reasonably clear that sentiment was profoundly negative early in this year, and that has improved significantly since January. And that, plus other statistics around employment, growth and other things, which suggest that the economy is poised to perform at better than that 0.5% number in Q1. Based on our information as opposed to GDP information that the U.S. market seems to us to be characterized by a number of short stories, if you will. Let me give you a few examples. Houston, weak, because of the weakness in the oil patch. New York, weak primarily because of supply growth but also maybe a bit because of the strength of the U.S. dollar and its impact on the international arrivals. Miami, weak probably mostly because of the weakness in Brazil, one of the great source markets for Miami and to some extent maybe growth in luxury supply. San Francisco, very strong, reflection of the strong health of the U.S. digital economy. And of course, L.A., also quite strong. Now our biggest customers also tell us things that are quite different. Many of them tell us that their book of business is solid and reflects continued health in their business in from their strength in the U.S. economy. Some wrestling with flattish top lines seem to be turning with greater attention to managing cost, including their travel budgets. Now when we roll all these anecdotes together, the view about these markets, what we see is a collection of short stories, but not a common theme, let alone, the same author. So our view as reflected in our continued 3% to 5% RevPAR growth guidance is that we expect the U.S. economy to continue to bump along with moderate GDP growth and therefore moderate occupancy growth, which, when combined with ADR growth, should deliver 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the year."

We also have maybe a slightly more conservative view here based on recent trends, but generally all of those forecasts are above the midpoint of that 3% to 5% range. And we would think, as a consequence, it's at least as likely we're at 5% as we are at 3%. This will, though, depend on what happens with transient demand in the quarters ahead."

Let me talk a little bit about the residential branding fees. As I'm sure you know, these stem from projects and often they're connected to our hotels, but they stem from residential projects where our brand is the part of those projects and we earn a fee on the sale of those residences. And it is not -- we are not paid for those until the they're not only sold but they are actually closed. So number one, you've got something that's open, so it's a little bit hard to predict exactly the pace of the sales and then the pace of the closings. But we have a project, Waikiki is a great example of one in Hawaii that began selling at the beginning late last year, and it's just been selling like hotcakes, and basically we expect it to sell out this year, 300 units. And we had, had, it more spread across the year while it turns out it was largely done in Q1 because it's so popular. The good news is this is a business that has been, although it is clearly cyclical related to the financing of real estate, it has been growing very nicely for us, particularly internationally. So when you look at this year's fees, the average over the last call it 5 years has been about $15 million a year. We do expect this year for that number to be closer to double that. But when you look over the next few years, Shaun, I think you're looking at a number of residential branding fees that probably is likely to be in the high 20s because we've got a great pipeline of projects that are moving along."

The amount we paid really will not be defined until actual closing, because it will be derived in significant extent from our own share price. And obviously, there are other aspects in Starwood's operating business that until we close we won't understand with real detail. Generally, though, what we think is that $250 million worth of synergy run rate would which Leeny talked about for 2017 is included in our assumptions about a roughly neutral EPS impact from the transaction. It is probably the first time we've held it out there as being a 1 1 17 as opposed to a second year I think is the way we've talked about it before.

I think the upside from that accretion, in other words, will be driven more by revenue synergies and margin synergies at the property level and how that drives unit growth and, then of course, what we do with the powerful and substantial cash that's going to be generated by this kind of business in either investing or in returning that capital to shareholders."

Obviously, they are visible online and we are doing some things. I think that early response has been positive, but it's too early to give you the kind of statistics that you've heard from some others who've been out there and market longer with us. We've obviously done it because we're optimistic about this approach driving an increase in direct bookings and driving that much more awareness of the advantages of direct booking. With respect to the loyalty programs, this is going to be very much a work in progress. It is clear that we will be running the Marriott Rewards and SPG programs for some period of time. I would think that, that's got to be more like 2 years than a year. But part of that is systems-driven, part of that is making sure that we deal with our customers in a way that keeps them excited about these programs and ask them participate with us in the way that they evolve. And then, of course, as your question implies, we've got a number of very powerful and strategic partners that are keenly interested in this program, timeshare companies and credit card companies being the most significant, but they're not the only ones. And we're going to want to make sure we work with them to -- in a way that is successful to them and respects their interest. And we'll sort of keep you posted on this. Obviously, we'd like to get to a place where we have a program which allows our growing group of loyal customers to have the benefits of the full portfolio of 5,500 hotels plus another 2,000 or so hotels which are in the combined pipeline, whatever those precise numbers are, and the ability to grow from there. So we'll be working to get as much functionality between those programs as we can and eventually, hopefully, a full merger. But we'll see how that goes, and we'll keep you posted about it."

And as a consequence, we often see the full year number sort of moderate as the year goes along. And that's not a sign of weakness. The other thing that's really important to bear in mind here is that the group business has the most power and help with pricing of a hotel in high occupancy, high demand months. So group business being up significantly in January, which is a relatively quiet month, or December, which is a relatively quiet month, is going to be much less impactful in driving rate than in nonholiday-impacted weeks and months like March, April, May, September, October, first half of November. And so we think we've got, again, in a number of these times, the group business should be more powerful helping us drive rate in the transient space."

You get to Asia Pacific, I think, is going to continue to perform well, but based on the trends that we've talked about. Middle East, because of Ramadan, will look weak in Q2. I think it will do better in Q3 and Q4. There are important things that need to happen there. I did an interview with an Arabian Hotel Investment Conference yesterday by videoconference. And for example, Egypt has got to do more on airport safety, I think, before it gets a lot of European aircraft coming back into the resort markets, but even to some extent, Cairo. And Europe, we were pleasantly surprised in Q1. Obviously, the Brussels tragedy took place very late in Q1. That's going to have a more negative impact in Q2 than it did for Q1. But at the moment, it feels Brussels and Paris focused in terms of weakness as opposed to Europe as a whole.

We have occasionally because management contracts get filed in SEC filings by either hotel owners or by brand companies, we've had some insight into specific management contracts. And generally, the structures are the same. And the rights and obligations of Starwood seemed to be comparable to those of ours. Starwood is, because they skew a little bit more full-service than we do, they also skew a little bit more towards managed as opposed to franchise than we do, which will make this a more relevant question, I think, in terms of the incentive fee performance. We obviously can't give you any sense really on what their incentive fee growth could be year-over-year. We've got some assumptions in our model, but we don't have any detailed inside view on that yet. But we would think, generally, it's going to be about the same. Obviously, we think their biggest owner is our biggest owner as well in Host. And I think the structure of those deals, as far as we know, is very similar."

As we move into next year, if one were to assume the RevPAR growth moderates, where do you expect that number to be for Marriott as it stands today and the combined company? How does that -- were you sort of profit neutral here respective of unit growth or other dynamics?"

You've got -- the core question there is most apt with respect to the hotel level economics. And we'll talk about Marriott's P&L in a minute. And you're absolutely right, we have tended to say RevPAR in the 2% to 3% range is typically what's necessary in order to maintain flat profit margins in percentage terms, which would mean that dollars of profit at the hotel level would be up 2% to 3% just as the revenue line itself was up. Look at Q1, our actual results. And we've got the 2 2.4-ish RevPAR growth, but hotel level margins up 90 basis points around the world, and that's tribute to our operating team, who continues to find a way to improve margins even with fairly modest RevPAR growth. So in that kind of environment, we saw in an actual Q1, we saw quite modest RevPAR growth. And hotel level profit growth on average going out more like the 4% to 5% range as opposed to the 2.5% RevPAR growth. I think when you look forward, it's going to vary significantly market by market. U.S. labor costs, obviously, are going to continue to rise. Some of this will be driven by politics and other things. I think much more of it will be driven by the labor, the tightness of the labor market. And the tighter it gets, the more likely we'll see wage growth move. I would think we're likely to see 3% to 4%, maybe 3% to 5% wage growth in the U.S. in the next couple of years. And as a consequence, you're going to still need that 2% to 3% RevPAR growth to get sort of flattish margins. For Marriott, by comparison, we've got a number of different drivers. We've got top line, which is going to be driven by that same-store RevPAR growth. We've got the incentive fees, which are a share of the hopefully growing profits in the hotel. And then significantly, we've got both the unit growth, which is entirely incremental to that. And the impact of what we do with the capital that we produce. And so all of those things, I think, would cause our fee growth to be significantly higher than whatever the RevPAR growth is in the market. Think simply, if you got 3% to 5% same-store RevPAR growth and food and beverage is growing at the same pace, we ought to see base in franchise fees grow at that amount for existing hotels plus some upside because of incentive fees. And then in addition to that, the unit growth, which we're talking about at 7% net of the units that we lose. That's a long answer to your short question, sorry about that."

And I'm not going to name companies, because these are great partners of ours, and I don't want to be trying to tell their stories publicly. But when you read the press, you can see a number of big companies who are reducing headcount because of struggle to grow top line. You can see a number of big companies that have got active shareholders that are foreseeing some focus on margins. But then you see a number of companies that are growing robustly. And a number of players in broad parts of the U.S. economy, across industries, think about the accounting firms and the consulting firms and banks and some of those things, and what you hear from them is a level of economic activity that seems steady and that causes them to be fairly optimistic. And as a consequence, I think we end up with different RevPAR performance in different cities. And I think to the extent those stories are accurate, they tend to have a more pronounced impact on the short-term medium transient than they do on the long-term medium group. Because as long as those companies are still performing well, which generally they are, they're going to hold that annual meeting. They're going to make those commitments for what they need to do to launch their new products or to bring all their customers together.

The commentary really is about the underlying strength in demand. And think about that as the transient business. I think we see continued modest growth in transient demand based on modest GDP growth pricing power. I think we do have a group dynamic as well that overlays this. And that is, to some extent, moving a little bit independently from what's happening in the demand environment because it's got a longer lead time. And as we've talked about before, we've got Q2 and Q3 group that's more robust than Q1. A big piece of that is Easter, but that's not the only piece of that. Part of that is just the of the group booking cycle if you will. And so when we roll those things together, we suspect we'll have stronger headline RevPAR number, obviously, in the balance of the year than we did in the first quarter of the year, where we were below the 3% in the first quarter of the year. So it goes by sort of by definition of that way.

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
First, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 28, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. 
So let's talk about the first quarter. In North America, comparable systemwide RevPAR rose 2.4% in the quarter. In January, North America systemwide RevPAR rose 3.1% despite the severe East Coast snowstorm. In February, RevPAR rose 3.4%, but March RevPAR increased only 1% as group meeting planners avoided the week before and the week after Easter. All in all, we estimate the shift in Easter holiday period reduced our systemwide RevPAR growth by about 1 percentage point for the quarter. 
A natural first question would be, why? With 2.4% North America systemwide RevPAR growth in Q1, do we think 3% to 5% growth is still the right range for the year? Strong group business on the books gives us confidence in the remainder of the year, including higher transient room rates that are likely to come with stronger group compression in the second and third quarters. In fact, April RevPAR through the 23rd is up 5.2%. Group booking pace for our full-service hotels in North America is up 7% for the rest of the year. First quarter RevPAR growth was strongest in Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the California desert while RevPAR in Chicago and Philadelphia declined due to unfavorable citywide calendars. Systemwide RevPAR at our limited-service hotels rose 2% in the quarter, constrained by a combination of weak demand from the oil and gas industries and new upscale supply. RevPAR at Ritz-Carlton increased more than 6% as recently completed renovations pushed both occupancy and room rates higher and the earlier Easter increased leisure business, particularly in Lake Tahoe and Bachelor Gulch, where the snow was deep and the skiing was great. 
STR expects overall U.S. supply growth of 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Interestingly, in the last 6 months, financing for new hotel construction in the U.S. has become more conservative. We understand that leverage levels on new construction loans have declined from 70% to 75% a year ago to 60% to 65% today. Loan pricing and recourse levels have increased. In certain markets, construction costs are also higher, particularly labor. While we aren't likely to see a material change in supply growth in the near term, longer-term we believe these conditions should discourage marginal new projects from going forward and could delay others.
While new industry construction could moderate in the U.S. over time, we believe our brand conversions will likely accelerate. Our Autograph brand reached 100 hotels worldwide in just 6 years, largely due to conversions. With 19 brands today and soon to be 30 brands, we now have even more opportunities for meaningful unit growth through conversions.
Elsewhere in the world, in the Caribbean and Latin America, the good news was Mexico, where RevPAR rose nearly 30% in the first quarter. This expanding economy offers great opportunities for limited-service development, along with very strong RevPAR growth. Our warm-weather resorts benefited from the shift in Easter in the first quarter, but concerns about the Zika virus triggered group cancellations in some markets in the region. 
In Europe, the economy grew modestly in the first quarter and systemwide RevPAR rose nearly 3%. The tragic events in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul depressed occupancy rates in those markets with some spillover concern impacting RevPAR results in London as well. Elsewhere in the U.K., RevPAR remained very strong. In Spain, the economy is rapidly recovering, and our hotels benefited from strong demand from U.K. and U.S. travelers. Instability in the Middle East and North Africa further enhanced Spain's appeal as a vacation destination. Demand for our German hotels remained strong in the quarter, with favorable fair business in Cologne and Berlin.
In the Middle East, geopolitical unrest and low oil prices depressed oil results in much of the region. While UAE occupancies remained over 80%, room rates were lower with new supply in the market. For Egypt, there were fewer flights to the Red Sea resorts, while in Saudi Arabia hotel demand was constrained by lower government spending. Looking ahead, Ramadan will start in early June this year, about 2 weeks earlier than last year, which should hurt second quarter RevPAR comparisons in the Middle East.
In Africa, our Protea hotels performed very well, helped by strong local business and international tourism, attracted by the weak South African rand. Protea systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose nearly 15% in the first quarter, and we expect it will increase at a high single-digit rate for the full year.
Our Asia Pacific region performed better than expected in the first quarter. While economic growth in China has moderated, consumer spending on travel remained strong. Shanghai and Beijing had very strong results in the quarter, with RevPAR up in the high single digits. Nearly 60% of mainland China hotel demand comes from mainland Chinese travelers and their numbers are growing. In the first quarter, the number of domestic Chinese travelers visiting our hotels in that market increased 7% while the number of mainland Chinese travelers visiting our hotels abroad increased 25%. Thailand and Japan were particular beneficiaries. Hong Kong continued to see weak mainland China demand due to its strong currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. In India, the economy is strengthening, and first quarter RevPAR was up 14%.
We see significant development opportunities outside North America, particularly for limited-service hotels. Today, our international limited-service development pipeline totals nearly 250 hotels with more than 47,000 rooms, a 30% increase from the last year. In Europe, after adding manpower to our development effort in recent years, we already have 70 limited-service hotels in our development pipeline, including more than 40 Moxy and AC Hotels. In India, 1/2 of our existing properties and 60% of our pipeline hotels are in the limited-service brands. In China, we recently signed the deal with Eastern Crown to launch Fairfield by Marriott. While none are yet in the pipeline, we expect to have 140 Fairfields signed in 5 years and 100 hotels opened by 2021. In Mexico, we already have 20 limited-service hotels open and another 16 in the development pipeline. Finally, in the Middle East, our limited-service hotels, Courtyard, Fairfield, Residence Inn and Protea represent 40% of our pipeline in that region.
Our unit growth is strong around the world. Excluding Starwood, we expect our worldwide rooms distribution to grow by 8% gross or 7% net in 2016. Based on STR industry pipeline data, 1 in 4 hotels under construction in the U.S. today will fly one of our flags. And worldwide, 1 in 7 hotels under construction will be flagged with the Marriott brand. We are already the biggest hotel company in the world when measured by total rooms open. We signed over 100,000 rooms in both 2014 and 2015. Those signings give us great confidence in our openings in the years ahead.
With our Starwood acquisition, we will become a more global company, able to better leverage global trends and seize opportunities. Following the acquisition, we estimate more than 1/3 of our rooms and fees will come from outside the U.S. We've talked a lot about the synergies in this transaction and the economies of scale that are inherent in this business. From G&A to reservations to the Frequent Traveler program, to the back of the house, we expect to recognize meaningful top line and bottom line improvements over time. And unit growth should benefit as well. With a broader brand portfolio, we will be able to offer the right brand for each asset and market. This means we can play in more sandboxes than many of our competitors, winning the highest value opportunities. We still expect the Starwood transaction will close midyear 2016. We are awaiting regulatory approvals from the EU, China, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. In the meantime, we continue to do the blocking and tackling to drive results and improve our business. 
In March, we introduced Marriott Reward Member Rates, designed to reward loyalty members who book direct. The list of member-only perks continues to grow. Loyalty points, mobile check-in and checkout, free WiFi and now, lower rates. Today, 65% of transient room nights come from rewards members. 
This month, we announced enhancement to the rewards part of Marriott Rewards, offering a wide array of curated special events and opportunities. In addition, an initial group of elite members will be invited to participate in a new elite concierge service. By developing a relationship with a member, the concierge will be able to anticipate their unique needs, ensuring the members' preferences are recognized and their desires are met before, during and after their stay. And for Gold and Platinum Elites, guaranteed late checkout should make traveling both more pleasurable and more productive. 
Marriott's competitive advantages are numerous, strong brands, widespread distribution, powerful sales channels, loyalty program and reservation systems, back-of-the house efficiencies, owner and franchisee preference and, most important, a culture focused on our people. But we also know that success is never final, so we are working to be even better. 
Now let me turn things over to Leeny for more about the quarter. Leeny?"

For the first quarter of 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations. Results on our owned, leased and other line co",1065,"Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations. Results on our owned, leased and other line contributed about $0.05 of outperformance, including $0.03 from branding fees from residential real estate and our Marriott Rewards credit card, and the balance largely coming from performance of our owned and leased hotels. 
Adjusted general and administrative costs were better than expected by about $0.01, mainly due to open associate positions. Interest in taxes were about $0.02 unfavorable, largely due to some discrete tax items in the quarter. All in all, it was a solid quarter.
Total fee revenue increased 5%. As you know, 2016 is a leap year. The extra day in the quarter did not impact our RevPAR statistics, but we estimate it added about 1% to our property level revenue and fee growth in the quarter. Base fees rose 4%, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth, offset by more than $4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Incentive fees increased 13%, reflecting roughly $3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a $2 million favorable recognition of a deferred incentive fee. Worldwide, 63% of managed hotels earned an incentive fee in the quarter compared to 48% in the year-ago quarter. In North America, incentive fees rose 23%, with incentive fees for our limited-service brands up 40% alone.
Franchise fees were flat year-over-year. Strong unit growth and RevPAR improvement were offset by $15 million of lower relicensing fees and $2 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $81 million in the quarter, 29% higher than the prior year, largely driven by higher branding fees associated with sales of Ritz-Carlton Residences and our cobranded credit cards. Our leased hotels in Tokyo and Jaragua showed much better results as they came out of renovation, but those results were offset by foregone owned profit from our Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas hotel, which became a company-managed property late last year.
Adjusted general and administrative expenses increased by $10 million, largely reflecting routine cost increases. This quarter, we benefited from $10 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding while the 2015 quarter benefited from $12 million associated with favorable litigation resolution. 
We repurchased nearly 4 million shares during the quarter for approximately $225 million. We expect to complete the Starwood acquisition midyear and expect to resume share repurchases in late 2016 once our leverage ratios return to targeted levels.
For our second quarter, our guidance assumes the Starwood transaction will close some time after June 30. For Marriott's legacy business, we expect second quarter North American systemwide RevPAR will increased 3% to 5%, reflecting strong group business already on the books. We expect international systemwide RevPAR will increase 2% to 4%, reflecting strong Asia Pacific trends, offset by weak RevPAR in the Middle East. We expect Marriott's fee revenue will increase 6% to 8% in the second quarter.
We expect our owned, leased and other results in the second quarter will increase roughly 25%, with continued strong branding fee, lower preopening expenses and higher profits from our owned and leased hotels. We expect G&A will increase 2% to 5%. Adjusted net interest expense should total roughly $40 million. All in all, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA will total $495 million to $510 million, an increase of 8% to 12%. Adjusted EPS should total $0.96 to $1, an increase of 10% to 15% year-over-year. This forecast assumes no share repurchase during the quarter and doesn't include Starwood transition and transaction costs.
Turning to the full year. We expect worldwide RevPAR for Marriott's legacy business will increase 3% to 5%. Combined with 7% net rooms growth, we expect our 2016 fee revenue will total roughly $2 billion, consistent with our forecast in February. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should total $310 million to $315 million, about $10 million ahead of our February forecast, largely due to stronger residential branding fees. We expect our full year adjusted general and administrative expenses will total $645 million to $655 million, about $5 million better than our last forecast, largely due to the open associate positions we mentioned about Q1. 
For the Marriott legacy business, 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. Excluding Starwood, we expect to recycle roughly $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments through 2016. 
Making an EPS projection for the full year 2016 is difficult given the uncertain timing of the Starwood transaction. To assist you, modelers, however, for full year 2016, we expect Marriott's standalone adjusted EBITDA will total $1.9 billion to $1.965 billion, about $15 million better than our February forecast. Given that 2016 transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we aren't including these costs in our guidance but rather expect to break out such expenses as actual results are recognized, as we did this quarter. When the transaction closes, we estimate we will issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increase total debt by roughly $3.5 billion, representing an estimated $20 million in higher net interest cost per quarter. Incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction will depend on purchase price accounting valuations that have not yet been completed. In the recent 8-K, we estimated incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction at roughly $52 million per quarter. Like you, we will rely on Starwood's forecast of their RevPAR growth, unit growth, asset sale assumption and adjusted EBITDA for their business. We eagerly await their first quarter results and 2016 outlook.
Our results in 2016 are likely to be messy. Including Starwood, by the end of this year, we expect to be back to our targeted leverage range and to have resumed share repurchases. We expect most of the corporate level cost synergies associated with the transaction to be in place by the beginning of 2017. We are committed to completing asset sales promptly. 
Including Starwood, we could see continued strong unit growth in 2017, even with our larger size. Also, we continue to believe the transaction will be earnings per share neutral in 2017 before including the benefits of possible revenue synergies.

I'm going to also give you a sort of general answer to the question you haven't asked, but I think it's top of mind for everybody. We think it's about -- as we said in the prepared remarks, we think the negative RevPAR impact was about 1 point in Q1 to the shift of Easter. The impact to Q2 could be about the same. Obviously, the impact to 1 month of April would be larger and it could be nearly 2%. Important to keep in mind though that last week, April still has passed over. And so we'll look at the impact when the dust ultimately settles and give you more precise calculation. But it would be something close to 2%, we would think, for April. When we look at our group bookings, which, of course, are the clearest long-term data we have, we see April and June relatively better than May. But we see good group for Q2 as a whole. We see good group for Q3 as a whole. Q4, okay, but not quite as good as Q2 and Q3. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've got about a 7% increased group revenue on the books for Q2 through Q4 compared to the same time last year. The biggest question at the moment, obviously, is not so much about group, but it's about the strength of transient demand. And so let's maybe start with the basics. Transient demand correlates most closely with GDP growth. Statistics out this morning show that U.S. Q1 GDP growth was only 0.5%, anemic even in the context of the fairly moderate U.S. economic recovery we've been witnessing the last few years. The question for all of us, including for you, is do we expect the U.S. economy to perform at higher growth rates in the quarters ahead? We do. It seems reasonably clear that sentiment was profoundly negative early in this year, and that has improved significantly since January. And that, plus other statistics around employment, growth and other things would suggest that the economy is poised to perform at better than that 0.5% number in Q1. Based on our information as opposed to GDP information, the U.S. market seems, to us, to be characterized by a number of short stories, if you will. Let me give you a few examples. Houston, weak because of the weakness in the oil patch. New York, weak primarily because of supply growth, but also maybe a bit because of the strength of the U.S. dollar and its impact on international arrivals. Miami, weak probably mostly because of the weakness in Brazil, one of the great source markets for Miami, and to some extent maybe growth in luxury supply. San Francisco, very strong, reflection of the strong health of the U.S. digital economy. And of course, L.A., also quite strong. Now our biggest customers also tell us things that are quite different. Many of them tell us that their book of business is solid and reflects continued health in their business in -- and from their perch, strength in the U.S. economy. Some wrestling with flattish top lines seem to be turning with greater attention to managing cost, including their travel budgets. Now when we roll all these anecdotes together, the view about these markets, what we see is a collection of short stories, but not a common theme, let alone, the same author. So our view as reflected in our continued 3% to 5% RevPAR growth guidance is that we expect the U.S. economy to continue to bump along with moderate GDP growth and therefore moderate occupancy growth, which, when combined with ADR growth, should deliver 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the year."

We also have maybe a slightly more conservative view here based on recent trends, but generally all of those forecasts are above the midpoint of that 3% to 5% range. And we would think, as a consequence, it's at least as likely we're at 5% as we are at 3%. This will, though, depend on what happens with transient demand in the quarters ahead."

Let me talk a little bit about the residential branding fees. As I'm sure you know, these stem from projects and often they are connected to our hotels, but they stem from residential projects where our brand is a part of those projects and we earn a fee on the sale of those residences. And it is not -- we are not paid for those until the they're not only sold but they are actually closed. So number one, you've got something that opens. So it's a little bit hard to predict exactly the pace of the sales and then the pace of the closings. But we have a project, Waikiki is a great example of one in Hawaii that began selling at the beginning -- late last year and it's just been selling like hotcakes, and basically we expect it to sell out this year, 300 units. And we had, had it more spread across the year while it turns out it was largely done in Q1 because it's so popular. The good news is this is a business that has been, although it is clearly cyclical related to the financing of real estate, it has been growing very nicely for us, particularly internationally. So when you look at this year's fees, the average over the last, call it, 5 years has been about $15 million a year. We do expect this year for that number to be closer to double that. But when you look over the next few years, Shaun, I think you're looking at a number of residential branding fees that probably is likely to be in the high 20s because we've got a great pipeline of projects that are moving along."

Leeny, in fact, mentioned in her prepared remarks that the depreciation and amortization, for example, won't get finalized until the transaction closes, because given the amount of stock we're using in the deal. The amount we paid really will not be defined until actual closing, because it will be derived in a significant extent from our own share price. And obviously, there are other aspects in Starwood's operating business that until we close we won't understand with real detail. Generally, though, what we think is that $250 million worth of synergy run rate, which Leeny talked about for 2017, is included in our assumptions about a roughly neutral EPS impact from the transaction. It's probably the first time we've held it out there as being a 1/1/'17 as opposed to a second year, I think is the way we've talked about it before. And again, we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that, that happens. We can't guarantee it. But we think that with that, we will get a relatively neutral performance on EPS. I think the upside from that accretion, in other words, will be driven more by revenue synergies and margin synergies at the property level and how that drives unit growth, and then, of course, what we do with the powerful and substantial cash that's going to be generated by this combined business in either investing or returning that capital to shareholders."

We've obviously done it because we're optimistic about this approach driving an increase in direct bookings and driving that much more awareness of the advantages of direct booking. With respect to the loyalty programs, this is going to be very much a work in progress. It is clear that we will be running the Marriott Rewards and SPG programs for some period of time. I would think that, that's got to be more like 2 years than a year, but we'll -- part of that is systems-driven, part of that is making sure that we deal with our customers in a way that keeps them excited about these programs and ask them participate with us in the way that they evolve. And then, of course, as your question implies, we've got a number of very powerful and strategic partners that are keenly interested in this program, timeshare companies and credit card companies being the most significant, but they're not the only ones. And we're going to want to make sure we work with them to -- in a way that is successful to them and respects their interest. And we'll sort of keep you posted on this. Obviously, we'd like to get to a place where we have a program which allows our growing group of loyal customers to have the benefits of the full portfolio of 5,500 hotels plus another 2,000 or so hotels which are in the combined pipeline, whatever those precise numbers are, and the ability to grow from there. So we'll be working to get as much functionality between those programs as we can and eventually, hopefully, a full merger. But we'll see how that goes, and we'll keep you posted about it."

I think our Q2 pace is probably down a little from that 9%, but still in the high single digits, 7 percent-ish. And Q3 would be in the mid-double digits. So pretty healthy. There is -- be careful about assuming that, that's awful development. When we start a year with high group bookings, it leaves a little bit less room for in-the-year, for-the-year group bookings. And as a consequence, we often see the full year number sort of moderate as the year goes along, and that's not a sign of weakness. The other thing that's really important to bear in mind here is that the group business has the most power to help with pricing of a hotel in high occupancy, high demand months. So group business being up significantly in January, which is a relatively quiet month, or December, which is a relatively quiet month, is going to be much less impactful in driving rate than in nonholiday-impacted weeks in months like March, April, May, September, October, first half of November. And so we think we've got, again, in a number of these times, the group business should be more powerful helping us drive rate in the transient space."

You get to Asia Pacific, I think, is going to continue to perform well, but based on the trends that we've talked about. Middle East, because of Ramadan, will look weak in Q2. I think it will do better in Q3 and Q4. There are important things that need to happen there. I did an interview with an Arabian Hotel Investment Conference yesterday by videoconference. And for example, Egypt has got to do more on airport safety, I think, before it gets a lot of European aircraft coming back into the resort markets, but even to some extent, Cairo. And Europe, we were pleasantly surprised in Q1. Obviously, the Brussels tragedy took place very late in Q1. That's going to have a more negative impact in Q2 than it did for Q1.

Starwood is, because they skew a little bit more full-service than we do, they also skew a little bit more towards managed as opposed to franchise than we do, which will make this a more relevant question, I think, in terms of the incentive fee performance. We obviously can't give you any sense really on what their incentive fee growth could be year-over-year. We've got some assumptions in our model, but we don't have any detailed inside view on that yet. But we would think, generally, it's going to be about the same. Obviously, there -- we think their biggest owner is our biggest owner as well in Host. And I think the structure of those deals, as far as we know, is very similar."

But on the subject of RevPAR growth, over the years, we've talked about a point at which all of the things being equal, you're effectively profit or earnings neutral, and that RevPAR growth number is something greater than 0, as I recall, or something in the 3% range. As we move into next year, if one were to assume the RevPAR growth moderates, where do you expect that number to be for Marriott as it stands today and the combined company? How does that -- where are you sort of profit neutral irrespective of any unit growth or other dynamics?"

You've got -- the core question there is most apt with respect to the hotel level economics. And we'll talk about Marriott's P&L in a minute. And you're absolutely right, we have tended to say RevPAR in the 2% to 3% range is typically what's necessary in order to maintain flat profit margins in percentage terms, which would mean that dollars of profit at the hotel level would be up 2% to 3% just as the revenue line itself was up. Look at Q1, our actual results. And we've got the 2%, 2.4-ish RevPAR growth, but hotel level margin is up 90 basis points around the world, and that's a tribute to our operating team, who continues to find a way to improve margins even with fairly modest RevPAR growth. So in that kind of environment, we saw -- in an actual Q1, we saw quite modest RevPAR growth. And hotel level profit growth on average going up more like the 4% to 5% range as opposed to the 2.5% RevPAR growth. I think when you look forward, it's going to vary significantly market by market. U.S. labor costs, obviously, are going to continue to rise. Some of this will be driven by politics and other things. I think much more of it will be driven by the labor -- the tightness of the labor market. And the tighter it gets, the more likely we'll see wage growth move. I would think we're likely to see 3% to 4%, maybe 3% to 5% wage growth in the U.S. in the next couple of years. And as a consequence, you're going to still need that 2% to 3% RevPAR growth to get sort of flattish margins. For Marriott, by comparison, our -- we've got a number of different drivers. We've got the top line, which is going to be driven by that same-store RevPAR growth. We've got the incentive fees, which are a share of the hopefully growing profits of the hotel, and then significantly, we've got both the unit growth, which is entirely incremental to that, and the impact of what we do with the capital that we produce. And so all of those things, I think, would cause our fee growth to be significantly higher than whatever the RevPAR growth is in the market. Think simply, if you've got 3% to 5% same-store RevPAR growth and food and beverage is growing at the same pace, we ought to see base in franchise fees grow at that amount for existing hotels plus some upside because of incentive fees. And then in addition to that, the unit growth, which we're talking about at 7% net of the units that we lose. That's a long answer to a short question. Sorry about that, but..."

And I'm not going to name companies, because these are great partners of ours, and I don't want to be trying to tell their stories publicly. But when you read the press, you can see a number of big companies who are reducing headcount because of struggle to grow top line. You can see a number of big companies that have got active shareholders that are foreseeing some focus on margins. But then you see a number of companies that are growing robustly. And a number of players in broad parts of the U.S. economy, across industries, think about the accounting firms and the consulting firms and banks and some of those things, and what you hear from them is a level of economic activity that seems steady and that causes them to be fairly optimistic. And as a consequence, I think we end up with different RevPAR performance in different cities. And I think to the extent those stories are accurate, they tend to have a more pronounced impact on the short-term, meaning transient, than they do on the long-term, meaning group, because as long as those companies are still performing well, which generally they are, they're going to hold that annual meeting. They're going to make their commitments for what they need to do to launch their new products or to bring all their customers together.

I mean, the commentary really is about the underlying strength in demand. And think about that as the transient business. I think we see continued modest growth in transient demand based on modest GDP growth and with it some pricing power. I think we do have a group dynamic as well that overlays this. And that is, to some extent, moving a little bit independently from what's happening in the demand environment because it's got a longer lead time. And as we've talked about before, we've got Q2 and Q3 group that's more robust than Q1. A big piece of that is Easter, but that's not the only piece of that. Part of that is just the [indiscernible] of the group booking cycle, if you will. And so when we roll those things together, we suspect we'll have stronger headline RevPAR number, obviously, in the balance of the year than we did in the first quarter of the year, where we were below the 3% in the first quarter of the year. So it goes by and sort of by definition of that way. But again, that would be a reflection more of group and normalizing of the holiday time than a characterization by us that it depends on a dramatically more healthy underlying economy than the sort of 2% GDP number, which we assumed to be the case."

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
First, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 28, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. 
So let's talk about the first quarter. In North America, comparable systemwide RevPAR rose 2.4% in the quarter. In January, North America systemwide RevPAR rose 3.1% despite the severe East Coast snowstorm. In February, RevPAR rose 3.4%, but March RevPAR increased only 1% as group meeting planners avoided the week before and the week after Easter. All in all, we estimate the shifting Easter holiday period reduced our systemwide RevPAR growth by about 1 percentage point for the quarter. 
A natural first question would be, why? With 2.4% North America systemwide RevPAR growth in Q1, do we think 3% to 5% growth is still the right range for the year? Strong group business on the books gives us confidence in the remainder of the year, including higher transient room rates that are likely to come with stronger group compression in the second and third quarters. In fact, April RevPAR through the 23rd is up 5.2%. Group booking pace for our full-service hotels in North America is up 7% for the rest of the year. First quarter RevPAR growth was strongest in Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the California desert while RevPAR in Chicago and Philadelphia declined due to unfavorable citywide calendars. Systemwide RevPAR at our limited-service hotels rose 2% in the quarter, constrained by a combination of weak demand from the oil and gas industries and new upscale supply. RevPAR at Ritz-Carlton increased more than 6% as recently completed renovations pushed both occupancy and room rates higher and the earlier Easter increased leisure business, particularly in Lake Tahoe and Bachelor Gulch, where the snow was deep and the skiing was great. 
STR expects overall U.S. supply growth of 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Interestingly, in the last 6 months, financing for new hotel construction in the U.S. has become more conservative. We understand that leverage levels on new construction loans have declined from 70% to 75% a year ago to 60% to 65% today. Loan pricing and recourse levels have increased. In certain markets, construction costs are also higher, particularly labor. While we aren't likely to see a material change in supply growth in the near term, longer-term we believe these conditions should discourage marginal new projects from going forward and could delay others.
While new industry construction could moderate in the U.S. over time, we believe our brand conversions will likely accelerate. Our Autograph brand reached 100 hotels worldwide in just 6 years, largely due to conversions. With 19 brands today and soon to be 30 brands, we now have even more opportunities for meaningful unit growth through conversions.
Elsewhere in the world, in the Caribbean and Latin America, the good news was Mexico, where RevPAR rose nearly 30% in the first quarter. This expanding economy offers great opportunities for limited-service development, along with very strong RevPAR growth. Our warm-weather resorts benefited from the shift in Easter in the first quarter, but concerns about the Zika virus triggered group cancellations in some markets in the region. 
In Europe, the economy grew modestly in the first quarter and systemwide RevPAR rose nearly 3%. The tragic events in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul depressed occupancy rates in those markets with some spillover concern impacting RevPAR results in London as well. Elsewhere in the U.K., RevPAR remained very strong. In Spain, the economy is rapidly recovering, and our hotels benefited from strong demand from U.K. and U.S. travelers. Instability in the Middle East and North Africa further enhanced Spain's appeal as a vacation destination. Demand for our German hotels remained strong in the quarter, with favorable fair [ph]  business in Cologne and Berlin.
In the Middle East, geopolitical unrest and low oil prices depressed oil results in much of the region. While UAE occupancies remained over 80%, room rates were lower with new supply in the market. For Egypt, there were fewer flights to the Red Sea resorts, while in Saudi Arabia hotel demand was constrained by lower government spending. Looking ahead, Ramadan will start in early June this year, about 2 weeks earlier than last year, which should hurt second quarter RevPAR comparisons in the Middle East.
In Africa, our Protea hotels performed very well, helped by strong local business and international tourism, attracted by the weak South African rand. Protea's systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose nearly 15% in the first quarter, and we expect it will increase at a high single-digit rate for the full year.
Our Asia Pacific region performed better than expected in the first quarter. While economic growth in China has moderated, consumer spending on travel remains strong. Shanghai and Beijing had very strong results in the quarter, with RevPAR up in the high single digits. Nearly 60% of mainland China hotel demand comes from mainland Chinese travelers and their numbers are growing. In the first quarter, the number of domestic Chinese travelers visiting our hotels in that market increased 7% while the number of mainland Chinese travelers visiting our hotels abroad increased 25%. Thailand and Japan were particular beneficiaries. Hong Kong continued to see weak mainland China demand due to its strong currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. In India, the economy is strengthening and first quarter RevPAR was up 14%.
We see significant development opportunities outside North America, particularly for limited-service hotels. Today, our international limited-service development pipeline totals nearly 250 hotels with more than 47,000 rooms, a 30% increase in the last year. In Europe, after adding manpower to our development effort in recent years, we already have 70 limited-service hotels in our development pipeline, including more than 40 Moxy and AC Hotels. In India, 1/2 of our existing properties and 60% of our pipeline hotels are in the limited-service brands. In China, we recently signed the deal with Eastern Crown to launch Fairfield by Marriott. While none are yet in the pipeline, we expect to have 140 Fairfields signed in 5 years and 100 hotels opened by 2021. In Mexico, we already have 20 limited-service hotels open and another 16 in the development pipeline. Finally, in the Middle East, our limited-service hotels, Courtyard, Fairfield, Residence Inn and Protea represent 40% of our pipeline in that region.
Our unit growth is strong around the world. Excluding Starwood, we expect our worldwide rooms distribution to grow by 8% gross or 7% net in 2016. Based on STR industry pipeline data, 1 in 4 hotels under construction in the U.S. today will fly one of our flags. And worldwide, 1 in 7 hotels under construction will be flagged with the Marriott brand. We are already the biggest hotel company in the world when measured by total rooms open. We signed over 100,000 rooms in both 2014 and 2015. Those signings give us great confidence in our openings in the years ahead.
With our Starwood acquisition, we will become a more global company, able to better leverage global trends and seize opportunities. Following the acquisition, we estimate more than 1/3 of our rooms and fees will come from outside the U.S. We've talked a lot about the synergies in this transaction and the economies of scale that are inherent in this business. From G&A to reservations to the Frequent Traveler program, to the back of the house, we expect to recognize meaningful top line and bottom line improvements over time. And unit growth should benefit as well. With a broader brand portfolio, we will be able to offer the right brand for each asset and market. This means we can play in more sandboxes than many of our competitors, winning the highest value opportunities. We still expect the Starwood transaction will close midyear 2016. We are awaiting regulatory approvals from the EU, China, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. In the meantime, we continue to do the blocking and tackling to drive results and improve our business. 
In March, we introduced Marriott Reward Member Rates, designed to reward loyalty members who book direct. The list of member-only perks continues to grow. Loyalty points, mobile check-in and checkout, free WiFi and now, lower rates. Today, 65% of transient room nights come from rewards members. 
This month, we announced enhancement to the rewards part of Marriott Rewards, offering a wide array of curated special events and opportunities. In addition, an initial group of elite members will be invited to participate in a new elite concierge service. By developing a relationship with a member, the concierge will be able to anticipate their unique needs, ensuring the members' preferences are recognized and their desires are met before, during and after their stay. And for Gold and Platinum Elites, guaranteed late checkout should make traveling both more pleasurable and more productive. 
Marriott's competitive advantages are numerous, strong brands, widespread distribution, powerful sales channels, loyalty program and reservation systems, back-of-the house efficiencies, owner and franchisee preference and, most important, a culture focused on our people. But we also know that success is never final, so we are working to be even better. 
Now let me turn things over to Leeny for more about the quarter. Leeny?"

For the first quarter of 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations. Results on our owned, leased and other line co",1065,"Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations. Results on our owned, leased and other line contributed about $0.05 of outperformance, including $0.03 from branding fees from residential real estate and our Marriott Rewards credit card, and the balance largely coming from performance of our owned and leased hotels. 
Adjusted general and administrative costs were better than expected by about $0.01, mainly due to open associate positions. Interest and taxes were about $0.02 unfavorable, largely due to some discrete tax items in the quarter. All in all, it was a solid quarter.
Total fee revenue increased 5%. As you know, 2016 is a leap year. The extra day in the quarter did not impact our RevPAR statistics, but we estimate it added about 1% to our property level revenue and fee growth in the quarter. Base fees rose 4%, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth, offset by more than $4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Incentive fees increased 13%, reflecting roughly $3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a $2 million favorable recognition of a deferred incentive fee. Worldwide, 63% of managed hotels earned an incentive fee in the quarter compared to 48% in the year-ago quarter. In North America, incentive fees rose 23%, with incentive fees for our limited-service brands up 40% alone.
Franchise fees were flat year-over-year. Strong unit growth and RevPAR improvement were offset by $15 million of lower relicensing fees and $2 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $81 million in the quarter, 29% higher than the prior year, largely driven by higher branding fees associated with sales of Ritz-Carlton Residences and our co-branded credit cards. Our leased hotels in Tokyo and Jaragua showed much better results as they came out of renovation, but those results were offset by foregone owned profit from our Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas hotel, which became a company-managed property late last year.
Adjusted general and administrative expenses increased by $10 million, largely reflecting routine cost increases. This quarter, we benefited from $10 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding while the 2015 quarter benefited from $12 million associated with favorable litigation resolution. 
We repurchased nearly 4 million shares during the quarter for approximately $225 million. We expect to complete the Starwood acquisition midyear and expect to resume share repurchases in late 2016 once our leverage ratios return to targeted levels.
For our second quarter, our guidance assumes the Starwood transaction will close some time after June 30. For Marriott's legacy business, we expect second quarter North American systemwide RevPAR will increased 3% to 5%, reflecting strong group business already on the books. We expect international systemwide RevPAR will increase 2% to 4%, reflecting strong Asia Pacific trends, offset by weak RevPAR in the Middle East. We expect Marriott's fee revenue will increase 6% to 8% in the second quarter.
We expect our owned, leased and other results in the second quarter will increase roughly 25%, with continued strong branding fees, lower preopening expenses and higher profits from our owned and leased hotels. We expect G&A will increase 2% to 5%. Adjusted net interest expense should total roughly $40 million. All in all, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA will total $495 million to $510 million, an increase of 8% to 12%. Adjusted EPS should total $0.96 to $1, an increase of 10% to 15% year-over-year. This forecast assumes no share repurchase during the quarter and doesn't include Starwood transition and transaction costs.
Turning to the full year. We expect worldwide RevPAR for Marriott's legacy business will increase 3% to 5%. Combined with 7% net rooms growth, we expect our 2016 fee revenue will total roughly $2 billion, consistent with our forecast in February. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should total $310 million to $315 million, about $10 million ahead of our February forecast, largely due to stronger residential branding fees. We expect our full year adjusted general and administrative expenses will total $645 million to $655 million, about $5 million better than our last forecast, largely due to the open associate positions we mentioned about Q1. 
For the Marriott legacy business, 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. Excluding Starwood, we expect to recycle roughly $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments through 2016. 
Making an EPS projection for the full year 2016 is difficult given the uncertain timing of the Starwood transaction. To assist you modelers, however, for full year 2016, we expect Marriott's standalone adjusted EBITDA will total $1.9 billion to $1.965 billion, about $15 million better than our February forecast. Given that 2016 transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we aren't including these costs in our guidance but rather expect to break out such expenses as actual results are recognized, as we did this quarter. When the transaction closes, we estimate we will issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increase total debt by roughly $3.5 billion, representing an estimated $20 million in higher net interest costs per quarter. Incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction will depend on purchase price accounting valuations that have not yet been completed. In a recent 8-K, we estimated incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction at roughly $52 million per quarter. Like you, we will rely on Starwood's forecast of their RevPAR growth, unit growth, asset sale assumptions and adjusted EBITDA for their business. We eagerly await their first quarter results and 2016 outlook.
Our results in 2016 are likely to be messy. Including Starwood, by the end of this year, we expect to be back to our targeted leverage range and to have resumed share repurchases. We expect most of the corporate level cost synergies associated with the transaction to be in place by the beginning of 2017. We are committed to completing asset sales promptly. 
Including Starwood, we could see continued strong unit growth in 2017, even with our larger size. Also, we continue to believe the transaction will be earnings per share neutral in 2017 before including the benefits of possible revenue synergies.

I'm going to also give you a sort of general answer to the question you haven't asked, but I think it's top of mind for everybody. We think it's about -- as we said in the prepared remarks, we think the negative RevPAR impact was about 1 point in Q1 to the shift of Easter. The impact to Q2 could be about the same. Obviously, the impact to 1 month of April would be larger and it could be nearly 2%. Important to keep in mind though that last week, April still has Passover. And so we'll look at the impact when the dust ultimately settles and give you a more precise calculation. But it would be something close to 2%, we would think, for April. When we look at our group bookings, which, of course, are the clearest long-term data we have, we see April and June relatively better than May. But we see good group for Q2 as a whole. We see good group for Q3 as a whole. Q4, okay, but not quite as good as Q2 and Q3. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've got about a 7% increased group revenue on the books for Q2 through Q4 compared to the same time last year. The biggest question at the moment, obviously, is not so much about group, but it's about the strength of transient demand. And so let's maybe start with the basics. Transient demand correlates most closely with GDP growth. Statistics out this morning show that U.S. Q1 GDP growth was only 0.5%, anemic even in the context of the fairly moderate U.S. economic recovery we've been witnessing the last few years. The question for all of us, including for you, is do we expect the U.S. economy to perform at higher growth rates in the quarters ahead? We do. It seems reasonably clear that sentiment was profoundly negative early in this year, and that it has improved significantly since January. And that, plus other statistics around employment, growth and other things would suggest that the economy is poised to perform at better than that 0.5% number in Q1. Based on our information as opposed to GDP information, the U.S. market seems, to us, to be characterized by a number of short stories, if you will. Let me give you a few examples. Houston, weak because of the weakness in the oil patch. New York, weak primarily because of supply growth, but also maybe a bit because of the strength of the U.S. dollar and its impact on international arrivals. Miami, weak probably mostly because of the weakness in Brazil, one of the great source markets for Miami, and to some extent maybe growth in luxury supply. San Francisco, very strong, a reflection of the strong health of the U.S. digital economy. And of course, L.A., also quite strong. Now our biggest customers also tell us things that are quite different. Many of them tell us that their book of business is solid and reflects continued health in their business in -- and from their perch, strength in the U.S. economy. Some wrestling with flattish top lines seem to be turning with greater attention to managing cost, including their travel budgets. Now when we roll all these anecdotes together, the view about these markets, what we see is a collection of short stories, but not a common theme, let alone, the same author. So our view as reflected in our continued 3% to 5% RevPAR growth guidance is that we expect the U.S. economy to continue to bump along with moderate GDP growth and therefore moderate occupancy growth, which, when combined with ADR growth, should deliver 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the year."

And we would think, as a consequence, it's at least as likely we're at 5% as we are at 3%. This will, though, depend on what happens with transient demand in the quarters ahead."

Let me talk a little bit about the residential branding fees. As I'm sure you know, these stem from projects and often they are connected to our hotels, but they stem from residential projects where our brand is a part of those projects and we earn a fee on the sale of those residences. And it is not -- we are not paid for those until the they're not only sold but they are actually closed. So number one, you've got something that opens. So it's a little bit hard to predict exactly the pace of the sales and then the pace of the closings. But we have a project, Waikiki is a great example of one in Hawaii that began selling at the beginning -- late last year and it's just been selling like hotcakes, and basically we expect it to sell out this year, 300 units. And we had, had it more spread across the year while it turns out it was largely done in Q1 because it's so popular. The good news is this is a business that has been, although it is clearly cyclical related to the financing of real estate, it has been growing very nicely for us, particularly internationally. So when you look at this year's fees, the average over the last, call it, 5 years has been about $15 million a year. We do expect this year for that number to be closer to double that. But when you look over the next few years, Shaun, I think you're looking at a number of residential branding fees that probably is likely to be in the high 20s because we've got a great pipeline of projects that are moving along."

Leeny, in fact, mentioned in her prepared remarks that the depreciation and amortization, for example, won't get finalized until the transaction closes, because given the amount of stock we're using in the deal. The amount we pay really will not be defined until actual closing, because it will be derived in a significant extent from our own share price. And obviously, there are other aspects of Starwood's operating business that until we close we won't understand with real detail. Generally, though, what we think is that $250 million worth of synergy run rate, which Leeny talked about for 2017, is included in our assumptions about a roughly neutral EPS impact from the transaction. It's probably the first time we've held it out there as being a 1/1/17 as opposed to a second year, I think is the way we talked about it before. And again, we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that, that happens. We can't guarantee it. But we think that with that, we will get a relatively neutral performance on EPS. I think the upside from that accretion, in other words, will be driven more by revenue synergies and margin synergies at the property level and how that drives unit growth, and then, of course, what we do with the powerful and substantial cash that's going to be generated by this combined business in either investing or returning that capital to shareholders."

We've obviously done it because we're optimistic about this approach driving an increase in direct bookings and driving that much more awareness of the advantages of direct booking. With respect to the loyalty programs, this is going to be very much a work in progress. It is clear that we will be running the Marriott Rewards and SPG programs for some period of time. I would think that, that's got to be more like 2 years than a year, but we'll -- part of that is systems-driven, part of that is making sure that we deal with our customers in a way that keeps them excited about these programs and has them participate with us in the way that they evolve.

And we're going to want to make sure we work with them to -- in a way that is successful to them and respects their interests. And we'll sort of keep you posted on this.

I think our Q2 pace is probably down a little from that 9%, but still in the high single digits, 7 percent-ish. And Q3 would be in the mid-double digits. So pretty healthy. There is a -- be careful about assuming that, that's awful development. When we start a year with high group bookings, it leaves a little bit less room for in-the-year, for-the-year group bookings. And as a consequence, we often see the full year number sort of moderate as the year goes along, and that's not a sign of weakness. The other thing that's really important to bear in mind here is that the group business has the most power to help with pricing of a hotel in high occupancy, high demand months. So group business being up significantly in January, which is a relatively quiet month, or December, which is a relatively quiet month, is going to be much less impactful in driving rate than in nonholiday-impacted weeks in months like March, April, May, September, October, first half of November. And so we think we've got, again, in a number of these times, the group business should be more powerful in helping us drive rate in the transient space."

You get to Asia Pacific, I think, is going to continue to perform well, but based on the trends that we've talked about. Middle East, because of Ramadan, will look weak in Q2. I think it will do better in Q3 and Q4. There are important things that need to happen there. I did an interview with an Arabian Hotel Investment Conference yesterday by videoconference. And for example, Egypt has got to do more on airport safety, I think, before it gets a lot of European aircraft coming back into, particularly, the resort markets, but even to some extent, Cairo. And Europe, we were pleasantly surprised in Q1. Obviously, the Brussels tragedy took place very late in Q1. That's going to have a more negative impact in Q2 than it did for Q1.

And if I can -- I assume it counts if I follow up someone else's question. But on the subject of RevPAR growth, over the years, we've talked about a point at which all other things being equal, you're effectively profit or earnings neutral, and that RevPAR growth number is something greater than 0, as I recall, it was something in the 3% range. As we move into next year, if one were to assume the RevPAR growth moderates, where do you expect that number to be for Marriott as it stands today and the combined company? How does that -- where are you sort of profit neutral irrespective of any unit growth or other dynamics?"

You've got -- the core question there is most apt with respect to the hotel level economics. And we'll talk about Marriott's P&L in a minute. And you're absolutely right, we have tended to say RevPAR in the 2% to 3% range is typically what's necessary in order to maintain flat profit margins in percentage terms, which would mean that dollars of profit at the hotel level would be up 2% to 3% just as the revenue line itself was up. Look at Q1, our actual results. And we've got the 2%, 2.4-ish RevPAR growth, but hotel level margin is up 90 basis points around the world, and that's a tribute to our operating team, who continues to find a way to improve margins even with fairly modest RevPAR growth. So in that kind of environment, we saw -- in an actual Q1, we saw quite modest RevPAR growth. And hotel level profit growth on average going up more like the 4% to 5% range as opposed to the 2.5% RevPAR growth. I think when you look forward, it's going to vary significantly market by market. U.S. labor costs, obviously, are going to continue to rise. Some of this will be driven by politics and other things. I think much more of it will be driven by the labor -- the tightness of the labor market. And the tighter it gets, the more likely to see wage growth move. I would think we're likely to see 3% to 4%, maybe 3% to 5% wage growth in the U.S. in the next couple of years. And as a consequence, you're going to still need that 2% to 3% RevPAR growth to get sort of flattish margins. For Marriott, by comparison, our -- we've got a number of different drivers. We've got the top line, which is going to be driven by that same-store RevPAR growth. We've got the incentive fees, which are a share of the hopefully growing profits of the hotel, and then significantly, we've got both the unit growth, which is entirely incremental to that, and the impact of what we do with the capital that we produce. And so all of those things, I think, would cause our fee growth to be significantly higher than whatever the RevPAR growth is in the market. Think simply, if you've got 3% to 5% same-store RevPAR growth and food and beverage is growing at the same pace, we ought to see base and franchise fees grow at that amount for existing hotels plus some upside because of incentive fees. And then in addition to that, the unit growth, which we're talking about at 7% net of the units that we lose. That's a long answer to a short question. Sorry about that, but..."

And I'm not going to name companies, because these are great partners of ours, and I don't want to be trying to tell their stories publicly. But when you read the press, you can see a number of big companies who are reducing headcount because of a struggle to grow top line. You can see a number of big companies that have got activist shareholders that are forcing some focus on margins. But then you see a number of companies that are growing robustly. And a number of players in broad parts of the U.S. economy, across industries, think about the accounting firms and the consulting firms and banks and some of those things, and what you hear from them is a level of economic activity that seems steady and that causes them to be fairly optimistic. And as a consequence, I think we end up with different RevPAR performance in different cities. And I think to the extent those stories are accurate, they tend to have a more pronounced impact on the short-term, meaning transient, than they do on the long-term, meaning group, because as long as those companies are still performing well, which generally they are, they're going to hold that annual meeting. They're going to make their commitments for what they need to do to launch their new products or to bring all their customers together.

I think we see continued modest growth in transient demand based on modest GDP growth and with it some pricing power. I think we do have a group dynamic as well that overlays this. And that is, to some extent, moving a little bit independently from what's happening in the demand environment because it's got a longer lead time. And as we've talked about before, we've got Q2 and Q3 group that's more robust than Q1. A big piece of that is Easter, but that's not the only piece of that. Part of that is just the vicissitudes of the group booking cycle, if you will. And so when we roll those things together, we suspect we'll have a stronger headline RevPAR number, obviously, in the balance of the year than we did in the first quarter of the year, where we were below the 3% in the first quarter of the year. So it goes by -- and sort of by definition of that way. But again, that would be a reflection more of group and normalizing of the holiday time than a characterization by us that it depends on a dramatically more healthy underlying economy than the sort of 2% GDP number, which we assume to be the case."

Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. 
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 28, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
The big news this year for Marriott is the Starwood acquisition. As you know, we have received all of the necessary regulatory clearances throughout the world, with the exception of China. We are in the second phase of China review and have been working cooperatively with regulatory authorities. Phase 2 review ends on August 9. We remain optimistic that we will receive clearance from China and will complete the transaction in the coming weeks. 
Before we move to specifics, let me make 3 observations about our results in the quarter. First, you will not be surprised that U.S. economic growth has been slower than we anticipated when the year began. In fact, over the last 3 quarters, room sales of our nearly 300 largest corporate customers have gradually weakened, from 4% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 2% in the first quarter and less than 1% in the second quarter. Fortunately, group business remains strong and discounted leisure business has picked up the slack. With half of the year complete, our second half North America RevPAR guidance assumes economic growth remains on the same slow pace that we've seen year-to-date.
Second, with the stronger dollar, we are seeing fewer international guests coming to our U.S. hotels, with the impact most pronounced in a few key gateway markets. We estimate the number of room nights occupied by international guests at comparable hotels in New York and Miami declined by 10% to 15% in the second quarter. For the U.S. as a whole, the number of room nights from international guests in our hotels declined by roughly 3%.
Third, specific regional issues have had a meaningful impact on RevPAR growth: terrorism in Brussels, Paris and Istanbul, Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America, oil prices in Houston and oil prices and unrest in the Middle East, to name a few. Combining the headwinds from the economy, foreign exchange and regional issues, Marriott's worldwide system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 2.9% in the second quarter, just below our guidance. We were pleased with this performance because despite the environment, RevPAR index data shows that we are taking share. Our already high system-wide worldwide RevPAR index increased 90 basis points year-to-date as we extended our lead over our competitive set.
We are also increasing our share of new development. Driven by the strength of our brands, we are already the largest hotel company in the world. Our global system totaled nearly 780,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter, and our worldwide pipeline increased to more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 15% higher than the year-ago quarter. 
In 2016, we expect our worldwide distribution, not including Starwood, will increase by roughly 7.5% gross or 6.5% net. According to STR, while Marriott has 11% of open rooms in the U.S. today, we have been selected to manage or franchise 30% of the rooms currently under construction, more than any other hotel brand company.
Our large pipeline is particularly impressive, given today's financing environment. New rules requiring banks to carry higher capital reserves have constrained lending, causing lenders to be more selective on both refinancings and new hotel construction. This selectivity includes more conservative loan-to-value ratios, a bias towards smaller transactions and caution about concentrated exposures in individual markets. To our benefit, lenders continue to favor the strongest brands.
While our business is cyclical, our cash flow is less sensitive than you might think. We estimate that 1 point of RevPAR worldwide over a full year moves our fee revenue by only about 1% or $25 million. And 1 point of RevPAR moves the net results of our owned and leased hotels by about $3 million. 
Meaningful unit growth and low risk fee revenue yields terrific operating leverage. Our performance this quarter highlights the fact. Second quarter comparable worldwide actual dollar RevPAR increased 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
Our business throws off outstanding cash flow. We make -- we may make investments from time to time for particularly attractive management or franchise agreements on high-value hotels. We also buy and build great brands and businesses. We've added 5 brands in as many years and the pending Starwood transaction will add another 11 brands. 
But if we can't find an attractive investment, we return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past 5 years, we have returned nearly $7.5 billion to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 130 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. We remain committed to minimizing owned assets and maximizing returns to shareholders. Our pretax return on invested capital was 50% in the second quarter.
Before I turn things over to Leeny, I'd like to say I am incredibly impressed with the people at Starwood. Despite the disruption and uncertainty they've experienced over the last 15 months, the Starwood team has done a great job, accelerating their development pipeline, spinning off Vistana, launching new marketing initiatives and opening nearly 125 hotels, all while also taking care of the guests and managing the everyday business. Thank you.
I'd also like to say that I have never been more proud of Marriott associates. This team has done a lot of transactions over the last 5 years, from the spinoff of Marriott Vacations Worldwide in 2011 to the more recent acquisitions of AC Hotels, Gaylord, Prodia and Delta. With each of these transactions, Marriott associates worked hard to first execute the transaction and then capture the strategic value of the deal, all while growing and managing our existing business.
The Starwood transaction should be completed in the coming weeks, bringing these terrific teams together. Both the Marriott and Starwood teams have done exhaustive planning to get ready, and we are excited by our prospects. While we will see a lot of progress in the near term, we expect that full integration will be a 2-year project.
We are bullish about the power of the combined company. Starwood is known for its very strong brands, marketing know-how and outstanding Frequent Traveler program. Marriott has a proven track record in creating and growing leading brands, improving underperforming brands and expanding distribution. 
The combination of Marriott and Starwood should bring even more, including cost savings in G&A and hotel operations and revenue opportunities. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's great brands, and the ultimate combination of our rewards program and Starwood preferred guests will create the most compelling Frequent Traveler program in the industry by far.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Leeny to talk more about our second quarter results. Leeny?"

Adjusted for the Starwood transaction expenses, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.03, an 18% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS was about $0.04 to $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our fees were about $0.02 to $0.03 below those expectations due to weaker-than-expected RevPAR and lower-than-expected franchise relicensing fees. 
Our owned, leased and other line was about $0.01 shy of our expectations due to slightly lower-than-expected branding fees. G&A came in about $0.01 favorable to expectations. The joint venture line was $0.01 to $0.02 better than expected, largely due to strong hotel performance. Finally, our tax rate generated $0.05 to $0.06 of better-than-expected EPS due to some favorable discrete tax items.
Worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose roughly 3%. For our company-managed hotels, worldwide house profit margins increased 60 basis points. In North America, company-managed RevPAR rose 3.6% and house profit margins rose 100 basis points. House profit margins benefited from productivity gains and lower energy costs.
On a system-wide basis, North America system-wide RevPAR rose 3.2% in the quarter, with particular strength in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Atlanta. Transient RevPAR rose 2% in the quarter as we maintained occupancy by opening discount channel. Group RevPAR rose 7% and catering sales increased more than 5% in the quarter. Overall, group cancellation rates remained normal and attendance at group meetings met our expectations. 
Group business continues to look solid for the second half of 2016, with system-wide North America group revenue pace up 5%, although the timing of holidays will influence quarterly comparison. Third quarter system-wide group revenue pace in North America is up 9% while fourth quarter pace is flat year-over-year. Encouragingly, 2017 group pace is up 7%.
Outside North America, second quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR rose 2% on a constant dollar basis or declined 1% using local currency. In Europe, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR increased 3%. Germany's RevPAR rose 9%, with strong group business. RevPAR in Spain rose at double-digit rate, benefiting from a stronger economy and large numbers of guests that would have visited hotels in the Middle East in the past. RevPAR in France, Belgium and Turkey remained very weak.
System-wide RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased nearly 6%. South Korea's RevPAR increased dramatically on easy comparison to last year's MERS outbreak. RevPAR in Greater China rose 3%, with very strong results in Shanghai and Beijing and modest growth in Hong Kong. Economic growth increased RevPAR in India by 10% in the quarter. 
We saw occupancy declines in the Caribbean and Latin America, largely due to weak economic conditions and the impact of the Zika virus. Occupancy rates were also lower in the Middle East and Africa region due to the earlier start of Ramadan, oversupply in Dubai, ongoing political unrest in many countries and the lower price of oil.
Total fee revenue in the second quarter increased 4%, with incentive fees up 16%. Base fees declined 3% due to a tough comparison to deferred fees recognized in the year-ago quarter and unfavorable FX rate. Franchise fees increased 6% despite $3 million less in lower -- in relicensing fees, reflecting fewer asset sales among our franchise community. 
Total incentive fees increased 16%, with North America hotels incentive fees up 22%. Worldwide, 64% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 59% in the year-ago quarter. In North America alone, 62% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 55% in the year-ago quarter. 
Owned, leased and other revenues, net of direct expenses, increased 20% in the quarter, reflecting renovations at the Tokyo Ritz-Carlton and the Renaissance Jaragua, somewhat offset by the sale of our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton last year. In addition, results reflect an easy comparison to last year's preopening costs for the New York EDITION hotel.
Branding fees increased 14%, with higher cardholder sales from our co-branded credit cards and higher sales of Ritz-Carlton Residences. Reported general and administrative costs increased 11% or 1% when adjusted for the $14 million of Starwood-related transition and transaction costs in the second quarter. Reported operating margins totaled 10% for both the 2016 and 2015 quarters. Adjusting for cost reimbursement and Starwood transition and transaction costs, operating margins reached 53% in 2016 compared to 50% in the prior year in the second quarter.
Interest expense increased to $57 million in the second quarter. Excluding the $11 million cost of a bridge facility commitment, adjusted interest expense totaled $46 million. In preparation for the upcoming transaction, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt during the second quarter. The 5.5- and 10-year notes were priced at the lowest interest cost for comparable maturities in the company's history. These offerings increased our long-term debt to $4.1 billion, paid off our outstanding commercial paper balances and increased our cash and cash equivalents to nearly $700 million.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margins totaled 65%. Making an EPS projection for 2016 is difficult. To assist the modelers however, we've provided some P&L guidance for Marriott's legacy business for the next 2 quarters. 
For the third quarter, we expect worldwide system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will increase 3% to 4%, benefiting from the favorable holiday pattern and the strong group bookings, including the Olympics in Brazil. Total fee revenue for the Marriott standalone business could total $495 million to $500 million, 6% to 8% growth over the 2015 third quarter. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to total $476 million to $481 million, a 10% to 12% growth over the prior year.
For the fourth quarter, we expect worldwide system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will moderate to a 2% to 3% increase, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons in North America. Total fee revenue for the Marriott standalone business could total $485 million to $490 million, a 7% to 8% growth over the 2015 fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to total $461 million to $471 million, a 15% to 17% increase over the prior year. We expect worldwide system-wide RevPAR will increase roughly 3% for the full year 2016. Given our expected 6.5% worldwide net unit growth and modest increases in G&A, we anticipate that our legacy business will generate roughly $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year, 10% more than in 2015. We expect incentive fees to grow at a midteens rate.
Compared to our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA forecast from last quarter, our current adjusted EBITDA outlook is $36 million lower at the midpoint. With more modest RevPAR growth, some construction delays pushing hotel openings into early '17 and fewer asset sales among our franchise community, we've reduced our fee outlook by $40 million, including $10 million in lower franchise relicensing fees. 
Elsewhere on the P&L, we reduced our owned, leased and other net forecast a bit due to some fine-tuning of our branding fee estimate, while our new forecast for G&A is about $10 million better than our prior forecast. For the Marriott legacy business, 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. 
Excluding Starwood, we anticipate recycling $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments during '16. Given that transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we are including these costs in our 2016 guidance but expect to break out such expenses as actual results are reported as we did this quarter. 
Like you, we rely on Starwood's publicly disclosed forecast of their RevPAR growth, unit growth and adjusted EBITDA for their business. When the transaction closes, we expect to assume Starwood's outstanding debt, issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increase net debt by roughly $3.5 billion for the cash component of the deal. Given we and Starwood are still 2 separate companies, we can't comment on the pace of Starwood's asset sales in 2016, but with the completion of the transaction, you can be sure we will be -- we will focus very quickly on getting back to our targeted leverage levels as quickly as possible.
With regard to future G&A spending, we expect to have our new organization largely in place by year-end 2016, although some transition costs will carry over into 2017 and even a bit into 2018 as we integrate our systems and technology platforms. We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million in steady state annual G&A savings. Once the transaction is complete, we will work to prepare 2015 and 2016 pro forma adjusted quarterly income statements to reflect the combination. These statements should be ready sometime this fall. We believe the transaction will close in the coming weeks. 
And now one more housekeeping matter for you. Our typical schedule for declaring third quarter dividend is immediately following our August board meeting scheduled this year for next week, August 4. While we plan to pay a dividend in the third quarter, the announcement of the third quarter record and payment date may be delayed a bit until there's greater clarity around the actual transaction closing date. 
We appreciate your patience as we work through these issues and particularly appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Crystal, we'll take questions now."

I think as we guided a quarter ago, we have an overly rosy view about the strength of GDP in the United States particularly. And as a consequence, we continue to stick with our 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the full year that we have provided at the beginning of the year. I think today, we have obviously experience actual second quarter number, which came in essentially right at the low end of our guidance in the United States and a little bit below the -- globally when you factor in some of what's happening around the world. And that, I think, is fundamentally a reflection of lower GDP growth in the United States than what we anticipated. But it is still positive GDP growth. I think to some extent, the question you and we could ask ourselves is, are we what, more solid, more confident in the kind of guidance we're giving today than what we give a quarter ago? And I think the best answer to that is that we now are making forecasts based on essentially the current pace of GDP growth in the United States, which is weak, not on a more rosy scenario. Is it possible the U.S. economy performs worse than that? Of course, it is. But when you look at the range of economic data that comes out, including recent employment reports and consumer confidence reports and corporate profits and some of those , it looks to us like it's a reasonably good bet that the economy will continue to grow, albeit growing maybe somewhat anemically. And there does not appear to be data out there which would suggest that it is getting meaningfully weaker from a GDP perspective. But that is the question to continue to keep your eye on."

And I think in some respects, that in a somewhat weaker market, somewhat more anxious market, that allowing the construction to take a little longer is a rational theme that some of our partners are doing. And as a consequence, we see that the construction pace has expanded just a little bit. We are not seeing cancellations of projects however. And I think generally, what we're talking about is projects that formerly we would have expected to open probably in the fourth quarter of the year, opening sometime in 2017. We've looked really hard at the incoming deals in our development pipeline. And I think we've been pleasantly surprised to see that new signings in most regions of the world are comparable, if not up a little bit, compared to the gangbuster year we had in 2015, including new deals signed in North America. And so we feel that actually it shows continued strong interest in growing with our brands and is not really a fundamental change but is a bit of fine-tuning on whether we'll open before or after New Year's Eve."

We've thought about a 2-point range here. The fact of the matter is to have a 2-point range at this stage of the year implies on the low end a much, much worse potential performance than we think is even potential. And on the high end, in many respects, requires us to envision a performance that is more optimistic than we think is really probable. And so as we went through this and you can see obviously, we gave out 1 full point range in our guidance for Q3 and then again for Q4, to some extent, you can do the math and see how that impacts. In a sense, you can say that our roughly 3% is kind of like a 2.5% to 3.5%, which would be the more normal range to look at. But we think we should be fairly close to 3% as the year comes in based on group and our present expectations about GDP growth."

I think we do continue to feel very comfortable that as quickly as we can, we will be back in the market.

I mean, I think the kind of pace we saw in the second quarter is more or less what we expect to take place over the balance of the year, with one significant clarification.

Group is meaningfully stronger in Q3 than in Q4, plus 10%-ish [ph] in Q3 and a flattish in Q4. Obviously, that puts us around plus 5% for the second half of the year as a whole. And so I would expect that we will see group, when you combine those 2 quarters, a more powerful driver of RevPAR growth than transient business. Transient, of course, includes both corporate travel, mostly during the week and leisure travel mostly during the weekend. We would continue to expect that leisure travel is going to be stronger than business travel. And that business travel will be kind of flattish, maybe up 1 point, 1 point or 2 depending on the way things go. I think if you wanted to be optimistic, you might say that we're bearing some of the consequences of the incredibly pessimistic mood that corporate America had as 2016 began. Think about our perspectives in the first quarter. And that's maybe a little bit of a lingering impact. And if there is -- because of economic data that's coming out or corporate profits or other things, a little bit less anxiety going forward maybe we could see that improve a little bit.

The -- we are -- I know one of our principal competitors talked about this yesterday in their call. They were a couple of months, maybe 3 months ahead of us, particularly in the marketing of their programs, but their data has got a few months' headstart for us. But I think what we're seeing in our Marriott Rewards member-only rates is very encouraging. We continue to see strong year-over-year growth in Marriott Rewards sign-ups. We see that the occupancy contribution from the rewards program is in the high 50s% of contribution to the hotels. We see strong growth in apps download and marriott.com business and mobile bookings and all those things so we're encouraged by that. It has had a modest impact, we think, on RevPAR in Q2, probably in the 30 to 40 basis point range on reported RevPAR, which in a sense, you can look at and say, that is a negative impact of it but this is a long-term question for us. And really what we want to make sure we're doing is communicating clearly to our Marriott Rewards members that they will have value because we know them and because they have loyalty to us and make it crystal clear sometimes, contrary to the advertising or perception that's out there in the market, to make it crystal clear that the rates channels are at least as good, if not better, than the rates that are available anywhere else. And obviously, if that drives a meaningful share shift towards our channels, that's a good thing and that's the bet we're making and we think it's a good bet."

And so really not just kind of adding necessarily before the merger where we have an opportunity to do it afterwards and do it in combination with the reorganization of how we want to run the company on a combined basis. So I think overall, these are good solid. The $10 million that you've seen is what I would call a permanent sort of solid reduction in G&A relative to cost controls. And I don't think we are imagining that there is, with the current standalone Marriott business, that we would be imagining that we're looking at an environment of needing to do a wholesale reorganization. We do continue to think that there are fantastic synergies related to the combination, which is you've heard we're still confident that the $250 million of steady-state savings in the combined company is achievable."

But again, we haven't really seen movement in there. So there's not data there that would tell us to beware because of that. In fact, you can tell from our comments about group, group is one of those things that we look at that give us some solidity in our point of view about the future. And the group attendance has been good and food and beverage spending has been good and so that's sort of reassuring. It's a good question around transient cancellation. Again, I don't think we've seen a shift there, but I don't -- I can't tell you whether in prior cycles, that would be a canary in the coal mine.

In terms of loyalty, we've got a host of issues in addition to both the logical issues around platforms and reservations, et cetera. We've also got some other things like credit cards and timeshare businesses where we need to work with our partners to get where we all want to go in terms of the relationship with the customer.

So it's sort of reminiscent of the headwind that strategy that was employed much earlier in the -- in the cycle here.

We think we've got about 11% of the rooms in the United States and a smaller share in the rest of the world, usually dramatically smaller than that 11%. We tend to run meaningfully higher rates than the market as a whole and we obviously do that with a purpose. That's partly because of the way our hotels are skewed in terms of their level of luxury and level of services, and that's partly about simply our approach to pricing. So there is lots of business out there that is more rate-sensitive and can be pursued by us if we think it is in our interest to pursue it. Obviously, we're also adding new units around the world. And whether that's at 6.5% or 7%, it is meaningful growth into our system. And so we are, with those new hotels, making sure we can also grab new customers in order to fill them and do what we need to do and the performance there has been great. And so I think there is plenty of business for us to continue to go and grab. I think that business cannot always be grabbed at exactly the rates at the highest rate of business we have in the hotels. But we do our best through revenue management and mix management and the like to drive optimal performance. And I think we've done well with that. Obviously, that's a top line focus sort of number. I would -- let me stress something on the bottom line too and maybe brag about it a little bit. But I think the 100 basis point improvement in margins in the managed portfolio in the United States in a 3% RevPAR growth environment is extraordinarily impressive. And that is a bit about good management of the top line but also it's great management of cost elements of those hotels. And both of those things, I think, tell you that we've got tools that we can use even in this sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we're experiencing today that can cause us to deliver yes, maybe it's low-ish single-digit RevPAR growth, but when you put unit growth and cost management and capital return to shareholders into the equation, you end up with this high teens or maybe even better EPS growth, 18% EPS growth in Q2. And that's with $20 million less in gains on asset sales because we have that in Q2 of 2015."

You can look at it for our total RevPAR numbers that we reported in the quarter. We obviously called out a number of the individual markets. But you look across the region and see, more often than not, good strong performance. Sometimes, in markets like South Korea, that is aided by an extraordinarily easy comparison as with the MERS crisis last year. But you look at India with its 10% RevPAR growth, that is driven by core economic growth in the country. China, we talked about with Mainland China RevPAR up about 3% in Q2, and if anything, that understates China's performance. We did have a shift in the way we report RevPAR year-over-year, which has something to do with service fees and service charges and some other fine-tuning event, which has about a 2-point impact on reported RevPAR in China in the quarter. And so, if anything, China is do better than the numbers that we reported. We've been pleased with China on the development side year-to-date. We obviously read the same newspapers that you do, and there is some anxiety there as there's many other markets around the world. But it seems that people are continuing to move forward with projects that have strength. And then on the negative side, Hong Kong has been sort of tougher market mostly because Chinese visitation has -- Mainland Chinese visitation has declined. Some of that is currency-driven, given that Hong Kong's dollar is essentially pegged to the U.S. dollar, and so as a consequence, has become more expensive as the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate around the world. We wouldn't expect that the story in Hong Kong is going to change for the better anytime real soon.

So it's -- IMF performance was really nice and broad, both North America as well as internationally, obviously impacted by some tough international markets, but overall, kind of strong growth overall. The other thing I would say on IMF is that as you think about where we are from a margin perspective, this performance is really top-notch in terms of the kinds of IMF growth that we are having relative to the RevPAR growth that's really great performance.

My guess is that often the way this works is if Q3, for example, were plus 10% [ph] or plus 9 points something in group business, we're more likely to end up with a group number which is a bit lower than that when the dust settles because there's not likely to be availability to take us much in the quarter, for the quarter group business as we probably took last year. The opposite may be the case for the fourth quarter though. So the fourth quarter hopefully will end up with actual group RevPAR numbers, which are better than 0.

Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Dir",1245,"Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. 
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 28, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
The big news this year for Marriott is the Starwood acquisition. As you know, we have received all of the necessary regulatory clearances throughout the world, with the exception of China. We are in the second phase of China review and have been working cooperatively with the regulatory authorities. Phase 2 review ends on August 9. We remain optimistic that we will receive clearance from China and will complete the transaction in the coming weeks. 
Before we move to specifics, let me make 3 observations about our results in the quarter. First, you will not be surprised that U.S. economic growth has been slower than we anticipated when the year began. In fact, over the last 3 quarters, room sales of our nearly 300 largest corporate customers have gradually weakened, from 4% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 2% in the first quarter and less than 1% in the second quarter. Fortunately, group business remains strong and discounted leisure business has picked up the slack. With half of the year complete, our second half North America RevPAR guidance assumes economic growth remains on the same slow pace that we've seen year-to-date.
Second, with the stronger dollar, we are seeing fewer international guests coming to our U.S. hotels, with the impact most pronounced in a few key gateway markets. We estimate the number of room nights occupied by international guests at comparable hotels in New York and Miami declined by 10% to 15% in the second quarter. For the U.S. as a whole, the number of room nights from international guests in our hotels declined by roughly 3%.
Third, specific regional issues have had a meaningful impact on RevPAR growth: terrorism in Brussels, Paris and Istanbul; Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America; oil prices in Houston; and oil prices and unrest in the Middle East, to name a few. Combining the headwinds from the economy, foreign exchange and regional issues, Marriott's worldwide system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 2.9% in the second quarter, just below our guidance. We were pleased with this performance because despite the environment, RevPAR index data shows that we are taking share. Our already high system-wide worldwide RevPAR index increased 90 basis points year-to-date, as we extended our lead over our competitive set.
We are also increasing our share of new development. Driven by the strength of our brands, we are already the largest hotel company in the world. Our global system totaled nearly 780,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter, and our worldwide pipeline increased to more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 15% higher than the year-ago quarter. 
In 2016, we expect our worldwide distribution, not including Starwood, will increase by roughly 7.5% gross or 6.5% net. According to STR, while Marriott has 11% of open rooms in the U.S. today, we have been selected to manage or franchise 30% of the rooms currently under construction, more than any other hotel brand company.
Our large pipeline is particularly impressive, given today's financing environment. New rules requiring banks to carry higher capital reserves have constrained lending, causing lenders to be more selective on both refinancings and new hotel construction. This selectivity includes more conservative loan-to-value ratios, a bias towards smaller transactions and caution about concentrated exposures in individual markets. To our benefit, lenders continue to favor the strongest brands.
While our business is cyclical, our cash flow is less sensitive than you might think. We estimate that 1 point of RevPAR worldwide over a full year moves our fee revenue by only about 1% or $25 million. And 1 point of RevPAR moves the net results of our owned and leased hotels by about $3 million. 
Meaningful unit growth and low-risk fee revenue yields terrific operating leverage. Our performance this quarter highlights the fact. Second quarter comparable worldwide actual dollar RevPAR increased 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
Our business throws off outstanding cash flow. We make -- we may make investments from time to time for particularly attractive management or franchise agreements on high-value hotels. We also buy and build great brands and businesses. We've added 5 brands in as many years, and the pending Starwood transaction will add another 11 brands. 
But if we can't find an attractive investment, we return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past 5 years, we have returned nearly $7.5 billion to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 130 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. We remain committed to minimizing owned assets and maximizing returns to shareholders. Our pretax return on invested capital was 50% in the second quarter.
Before I turn things over to Leeny, I'd like to say I am incredibly impressed with the people at Starwood. Despite the disruption and uncertainty they've experienced over the last 15 months, the Starwood team has done a great job, accelerating their development pipeline, spinning off Vistana, launching new marketing initiatives and opening nearly 125 hotels, all while also taking care of the guests and managing the everyday business. Thank you.
I'd also like to say that I have never been more proud of Marriott associates. This team has done a lot of transactions over the last 5 years, from the spinoff of Marriott Vacations Worldwide in 2011 to the more recent acquisitions of AC Hotels, Gaylord, Prodia and Delta. With each of these transactions, Marriott associates worked hard to first execute the transaction and then capture the strategic value of the deal, all while growing and managing our existing business.
The Starwood transaction should be completed in the coming weeks, bringing these terrific teams together. Both the Marriott and Starwood teams have done exhaustive planning to get ready, and we are excited by our prospects. While we will see a lot of progress in the near term, we expect that full integration will be a 2-year project.
We are bullish about the power of the combined company. Starwood is known for its very strong brands, marketing know-how and outstanding Frequent Traveler program. Marriott has a proven track record in creating and growing leading brands, improving underperforming brands and expanding distribution. 
The combination of Marriott and Starwood should bring even more, including cost savings in G&A and hotel operations and revenue opportunities. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's great brands, and the ultimate combination of our rewards program and Starwood Preferred Guest will create the most compelling Frequent Traveler program in the industry by far.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Leeny to talk more about our second quarter results. Leeny?"

In the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.96, a 10% increase from the prior year. Adjusted for the Starwood transaction expenses, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.03, an 18% increase from the prior year. Adjust",1551,"Thanks, Arne. In the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.96, a 10% increase from the prior year. Adjusted for the Starwood transaction expenses, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.03, an 18% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS was about $0.04 to $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our fees were about $0.02 to $0.03 below those expectations due to weaker-than-expected RevPAR and lower-than-expected franchise relicensing fees. 
Our owned, leased and other line was about $0.01 shy of our expectations due to slightly lower-than-expected branding fees. G&A came in about $0.01 favorable to expectations. The joint venture line was $0.01 to $0.02 better than expected, largely due to strong hotel performance. Finally, our tax rate generated $0.05 to $0.06 of better-than-expected EPS due to some favorable discrete tax items.
Worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose roughly 3%. For our company-managed hotels, worldwide house profit margins increased 60 basis points. In North America, company-managed RevPAR rose 3.6% and house profit margins rose 100 basis points. House profit margins benefited from productivity gains and lower energy costs.
On a system-wide basis, North America system-wide RevPAR rose 3.2% in the quarter, with particular strength in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Atlanta. Transient RevPAR rose 2% in the quarter as we maintained occupancy by opening discount channel. Group RevPAR rose 7%, and catering sales increased more than 5% in the quarter. Overall, group cancellation rates remained normal and attendance at group meetings met our expectations. 
Group business continues to look solid for the second half of 2016, with system-wide North America group revenue pace up 5%, although the timing of holidays will influence quarterly comparisons. Third quarter system-wide group revenue pace in North America is up 9%, while fourth quarter pace is flat year-over-year. Encouragingly, 2017 group pace is up 7%.
Outside North America, second quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR rose 2% on a constant dollar basis or declined 1% using local currency. In Europe, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR increased 3%. Germany's RevPAR rose 9%, with strong group business. RevPAR in Spain rose at double-digit rate, benefiting from a stronger economy and large numbers of guests that would have visited hotels in the Middle East in the past. RevPAR in France, Belgium and Turkey remained very weak.
System-wide RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased nearly 6%. South Korea's RevPAR increased dramatically on easy comparison to last year's MERS outbreak. RevPAR in Greater China rose 3%, with very strong results in Shanghai and Beijing and modest growth in Hong Kong. Economic growth increased RevPAR in India by 10% in the quarter. 
We saw occupancy declines in the Caribbean and Latin America, largely due to weak economic conditions and the impact of the Zika virus. Occupancy rates were also lower in the Middle East and Africa region due to the earlier start of Ramadan, oversupply in Dubai, ongoing political unrest in many countries and the lower price of oil.
Total fee revenue in the second quarter increased 4%, with incentive fees up 16%. Base fees declined 3% due to a tough comparison to deferred fees recognized in the year-ago quarter and unfavorable FX rate. Franchise fees increased 6% despite $3 million less in lower -- in relicensing fees, reflecting fewer asset sales among our franchise community. 
Total incentive fees increased 16%, with North America hotels incentive fees up 22%. Worldwide, 64% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 59% in the year-ago quarter. In North America alone, 62% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 55% in the year-ago quarter. 
Owned, leased and other revenues, net of direct expenses, increased 20% in the quarter, reflecting renovations at the Tokyo Ritz-Carlton and the Renaissance Jaragua, somewhat offset by the sale of our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton last year. In addition, results reflect an easy comparison to last year's preopening costs for the New York EDITION hotel.
Branding fees increased 14%, with higher cardholder sales from our co-branded credit cards and higher sales of Ritz-Carlton Residences. Reported general and administrative costs increased 11% or 1% when adjusted for the $14 million of Starwood-related transition and transaction costs in the second quarter. Reported operating margins totaled 10% for both the 2016 and 2015 quarters. Adjusting for cost reimbursement and Starwood transition and transaction costs, operating margins reached 53% in 2016 compared to 50% in the prior year in the second quarter.
Interest expense increased to $57 million in the second quarter. Excluding the $11 million cost of a bridge facility commitment, adjusted interest expense totaled $46 million. In preparation for the upcoming transaction, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt during the second quarter. The 5.5- and 10-year notes were priced at the lowest interest cost for comparable maturities in the company's history. These offerings increased our long-term debt to $4.1 billion, paid off our outstanding commercial paper balances and increased our cash and cash equivalents to nearly $700 million.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margins totaled 65%. Making an EPS projection for 2016 is difficult. To assist the modelers, however, we've provided some P&L guidance for Marriott's legacy business for the next 2 quarters. 
For the third quarter, we expect worldwide system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will increase 3% to 4%, benefiting from the favorable holiday pattern and the strong group bookings, including the Olympics in Brazil. Total fee revenue for the Marriott stand-alone business could total $495 million to $500 million, 6% to 8% growth over the 2015 third quarter. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to total $476 million to $481 million, a 10% to 12% growth over the prior year.
For the fourth quarter, we expect worldwide system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will moderate to a 2% to 3% increase, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons in North America. Total fee revenue for the Marriott stand-alone business could total $485 million to $490 million, a 7% to 8% growth over the 2015 fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to total $461 million to $471 million, a 15% to 17% increase over the prior year. We expect worldwide system-wide RevPAR will increase roughly 3% for the full year 2016. Given our expected 6.5% worldwide net unit growth and modest increases in G&A, we anticipate that our legacy business will generate roughly $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year, 10% more than in 2015. We expect incentive fees to grow at a mid-teens rate.
Compared to our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA forecast from last quarter, our current adjusted EBITDA outlook is $36 million lower at the midpoint. With more modest RevPAR growth, some construction delays pushing hotel openings into early '17 and fewer asset sales among our franchise community, we've reduced our fee outlook by $40 million, including $10 million in lower franchise relicensing fees. 
Elsewhere on the P&L, we reduced our owned, leased and other net forecast a bit due to some fine-tuning of our branding fee estimate, while our new forecast for G&A is about $10 million better than our prior forecast. For the Marriott legacy business, 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. 
Excluding Starwood, we anticipate recycling $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments during '16. Given that transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we are including these costs in our 2016 guidance but expect to break out such expenses as actual results are reported, as we did this quarter. 
Like you, we rely on Starwood's publicly disclosed forecast of their RevPAR growth, unit growth and adjusted EBITDA for their business. When the transaction closes, we expect to assume Starwood's outstanding debt, issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increase net debt by roughly $3.5 billion for the cash component of the deal. Given we and Starwood are still 2 separate companies, we can't comment on the pace of Starwood's asset sales in 2016, but with the completion of the transaction, you can be sure we will be -- we will focus very quickly on getting back to our targeted leverage levels as quickly as possible.
With regard to future G&A spending, we expect to have our new organization largely in place by year-end 2016, although some transition costs will carry over into 2017 and even a bit into 2018 as we integrate our systems and technology platforms. We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million in steady state annual G&A savings. Once the transaction is complete, we will work to prepare 2015 and 2016 pro forma adjusted quarterly income statements to reflect the combination. These statements should be ready sometime this fall. We believe the transaction will close in the coming weeks. 
And now one more housekeeping matter for you. Our typical schedule for declaring a third quarter dividend is immediately following our August board meeting scheduled this year for next week, August 4. While we plan to pay a dividend in the third quarter, the announcement of the third quarter record and payment date may be delayed a bit until there's greater clarity around the actual transaction closing date. 
We appreciate your patience as we work through these issues and particularly appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Crystal, we'll take questions now."

I think as we guided a quarter ago, we have an overly rosy view about the strength of GDP in the United States, particularly. And as a consequence, we continue to stick with our 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the full year that we have provided at the beginning of the year. I think, today, we have obviously experienced actual second quarter number, which came in essentially right at the low end of our guidance in the United States and a little bit below the -- globally when you factor in some of what's happening around the world. And that, I think, is fundamentally a reflection of lower GDP growth in the United States than what we anticipated. But it is still positive GDP growth. I think, to some extent, the question you and we could ask of ourselves is, are we what, more solid, more confident in the kind of guidance we're giving today than what we gave a quarter ago? And I think the best answer to that is that we now are making forecasts based on essentially the current pace of GDP growth in the United States, which is weak, not on a more rosy scenario. Is it possible the U.S. economy performs worse than that? Of course, it is. But when you look at the range of economic data that comes out, including recent employment reports and consumer confidence reports and corporate profits and some of those sorts of things, it looks to us like it's a reasonably good bet that the economy will continue to grow, albeit grow maybe somewhat anemically. And there does not appear to be data out there which would suggest that it is getting meaningfully weaker from a GDP perspective. But that is the question to continue to keep your eye on."

And I think in some respects, that in a somewhat weaker market, somewhat more anxious market, that allowing the construction to take a little longer is a rational thing that some of our partners are doing. And as a consequence, we see that the construction pace has expanded just a little bit. We are not seeing cancellations of projects, however. And I think generally, what we're talking about is projects that formerly we would have expected to open probably in the fourth quarter of the year, opening sometime in 2017. We've looked really hard at the incoming deals in our development pipeline. And I think we've been pleasantly surprised to see that new signings in most regions of the world are comparable, if not up a little bit, compared to the gangbuster year we had in 2015, including new deals signed in North America. And so we feel that actually it shows continued strong interest in growing with our brands and is not really a fundamental change, but is a bit of fine-tuning on whether we'll open before or after New Year's Eve."

The fact of the matter is to have a 2-point range at this stage of the year implies on the low end a much, much worse potential performance than we think is even potential.

And so as we went through this and you can see obviously, we gave out 1 full point range in our guidance for Q3 and then again for Q4, to some extent, you can do the math and see how that impacts. In a sense, you could say that our roughly 3% is kind of like a 2.5% to 3.5%, which would be the more normal range to look at.

So obviously, we would have loved to have been closed by now in terms of having this call. And as you move through the year, the later and later the close you get, the harder it is to know exactly where we will be 3 months from now or 4 months from now, given we haven't closed yet. We -- I'm not going to pretend to know all the details about exactly where every transaction is on the asset sales side with Starwood. And so we will need to get in there as soon as the asset -- as soon as the deal closes and evaluate exactly where it is. I think we do continue to feel very comfortable that as quickly as we can, we will be back in the market. And whether that frankly happens to be towards the end of the Q4 or the beginning of Q1 does depend, to some extent, on exactly which deals close in the fourth quarter and first quarter. But I think, give or take, a few months, I think we see it exactly the same place we did before. It's just again, we don't have specific visibility on exact timing of the closing of asset sales. And to get from where -- as we said before, we would expect to be somewhere in the ballpark of 3.6 and then want to get down to 3 to 3.25. And if we don't close until sometime in August, to get there by the end of Q4 definitely depends on some asset sales. So we'll be updating you as quickly as we can."

So kind of in light of that, as you look towards the second half of the year and given what is going on in business transient demand and in -- just in the corporate world, I was just wondering what level of business transient demand you're factoring into the guidance for the second half."

The -- I'm not sure if I can answer that off the top of my head. I mean, I think the kind of pace we saw in the second quarter is more or less what we'd expect to take place over the balance of the year, with one significant clarification. And that is in part because of calendar timing and in part, simply because of the rhythms of group business. Group is meaningfully stronger in Q3 than in Q4, plus 10%-ish in Q3 and a flattish in Q4. Obviously, that puts us around plus 5% for the second half of the year as a whole. And so I would expect that we will see group be, when you combine those 2 quarters, a more powerful driver of RevPAR growth than transient business. Transient, of course, includes both corporate travel, mostly during the week and leisure travel mostly during the weekend. We would continue to expect that leisure travel is going to be stronger than business travel. And that business travel will be kind of flattish, maybe up 1 point -- 1 point or 2 depending on the way things go. I think if you wanted to be optimistic, you might say that we're bearing some of the consequences of the incredibly pessimistic mood that corporate America had as 2016 began, thinking about our perspectives in the first quarter. And that's maybe a little bit of a lingering impact. And if there is -- because of the economic data that's coming out or corporate profits or other things, a little bit less anxiety going forward maybe we could see that improve a little bit. But again, we're essentially forecasting a kind of steady-state weak corporate transient demand, not falling off a cliff in any respect but just sort of continuing to bump along."

The -- we are -- I know one of our principal competitors talked about this yesterday in their call. They were a couple of months, maybe 3 months ahead of us, particularly in the marketing of their programs, but their data has got a few months head start for us.

We see that the occupancy contribution from the rewards program is in the high 50s% of contribution to the hotels. We see strong growth in apps download and marriott.com business and mobile bookings and all those things, so we're encouraged by that. It has had a modest impact, we think, on RevPAR in Q2, probably in the 30 to 40 basis point range on reported RevPAR, which, in a sense, you could look at and say, that's, what, that is a negative impact of it, but this is a long-term question for us. And really, what we want to make sure we're doing is communicating clearly to our Marriott Rewards members that they will have value because we know them and because they have loyalty to us and make it crystal clear, sometimes contrary to the advertising or perception that's out there in the market, but make it crystal clear that the rates of our channels are at least as good, if not better, than the rates that are available anywhere else.

Certainly, in the group space, if you've got a shrinkage that is occurring sort of real-time so that groups are showing up with meaningfully lower numbers than what they anticipated before, that could be a warning that group participants or the company sponsoring groups are less bullish about things than they were when the reservation group booking was first made. But again, we haven't really seen movement in that. So there's not data there that would tell us to beware because of that. In fact, you can tell from our comments about group, group is one of those things that we look at that give us some solidity in our point of view about the future. And the group attendance has been good, and food and beverage spending has been good, and so that's sort of reassuring. It's a good question around transient cancellation. Again, I don't think we've seen a shift there, but I don't -- I can't tell you whether in prior cycles, that would be a canary in the coal mine. My guess is it's not very much because corporate transient business is booked so short before the stay. But actually, it doesn't show up so much in cancellation but probably just shows up in the booking itself."

This integration of these 2 companies, when you think about it, kind of what we guided to, get in there, look at it and then figure out from a transition standpoint that it is a 2-year integration is definitely something that you should expect. In terms of loyalty, we've got a host of issues in addition to both the technological issues around platforms and reservations, et cetera. We've also got some other things like credit cards and timeshare businesses where we need to work with our partners to get where we all want to go in terms of the relationship with the customer. And that one's a little bit harder to pick exactly a time. I think, we've said before that we're hopeful by '18 to have merged the loyalty program.

We think we've got about 11% of the rooms in the United States and a smaller share in the rest of the world, usually dramatically smaller than that 11%. We tend to run meaningfully higher rates than the market as a whole and we obviously do that with a purpose. That's partly because of the way our hotels are skewed in terms of their level of luxury and level of services, and that's partly about simply our approach to pricing. So there is lots of business out there that is more rate-sensitive and can be pursued by us if we think it is in our interest to pursue it. Obviously, we're also adding new units around the world. And whether that's at 6.5% or 7%, it is meaningful growth into our system. And so we are, with those new hotels, making sure we can also grab new customers in order to fill them and do what we need to do. And the performance there has been great. And so I think there is plenty of business for us to continue to go and grab. I think that business cannot always be grabbed at exactly the rates at the highest rate of business we have in the hotels. But we do our best through revenue management and mix management and the like to drive optimal performance. And I think we've done well with that. Obviously, that's a top line focus sort of number. I would -- let me stress something on the bottom line, too, and maybe brag about it a little bit. But I think, the 100 basis point improvement in margins in the managed portfolio in the United States in a 3% RevPAR growth environment is extraordinarily impressive. And that is a bit about good management of the top line but it's also great management of the cost elements of those hotels. And both of those things, I think, tell you that we've got tools that we can use even in this sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we're experiencing today that can cause us to deliver. Yes, maybe it's low-ish single-digit RevPAR growth, but when you put unit growth and cost management and capital return to shareholders into the equation, you end up with this high teens or maybe even better EPS growth, 18% EPS growth in Q2. And that's with $20 million less in gains on asset sales because we have that in Q2 of 2015."

You can look at it for our total RevPAR numbers that we reported in the quarter. We obviously called out a number of the individual markets. But you look across the region and see, more often than not, good, strong performance. Sometimes, in markets like South Korea, that is aided by an extraordinarily easy comparison because of the MERS crisis last year. But you look at India with its 10% RevPAR growth, that is driven by core economic growth in the country. China, we talked about, with Mainland China RevPAR up about 3% in Q2. And if anything, that understates China's performance. We did have a shift in the way we report RevPAR year-over-year, which has something to do with service fees and service charges and some other fine-tuning event, which has about a 2-point impact on reported RevPAR in China in the quarter. And so, if anything, China is doing even better than the numbers that we reported. We've been pleased with China on the development side year-to-date. We obviously read the same newspapers that you do, and there is some anxiety there as there is in many other markets around the world, but it seems that people are continuing to move forward with projects that have strength. And then, on the negative side, Hong Kong has been sort of tougher market mostly because Chinese visitation has -- Mainland Chinese visitation has declined. Some of that is currency-driven, given that Hong Kong's dollar is essentially pegged to the U.S. dollar, and so as a consequence, has become more expensive as the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate around the world. We wouldn't expect that Hong -- the story in Hong Kong is going to change for the better anytime real soon.

My guess is that, often, the way this works is if Q3, for example, were plus 10 or plus 9 point something in group business, we're more likely to end up with a group number which is a bit lower than that when the dust settles because there's not likely to be availability to take us much in the quarter, for the quarter group business as we probably took last year. The opposite may be the case for the fourth quarter though. So the fourth quarter hopefully will end up with actual group RevPAR numbers, which are better than 0.

Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. 
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 28, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
The big news this year for Marriott is the Starwood acquisition. As you know, we have received all of the necessary regulatory clearances throughout the world, with the exception of China. We are in the second phase of China review and have been working cooperatively with the regulatory authorities. Phase 2 review ends on August 9. We remain optimistic that we will receive clearance from China and will complete the transaction in the coming weeks. 
Before we move to specifics, let me make 3 observations about our results in the quarter. First, you will not be surprised that U.S. economic growth has been slower than we anticipated when the year began. In fact, over the last 3 quarters, room sales of our nearly 300 largest corporate customers have gradually weakened, from 4% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 2% in the first quarter and less than 1% in the second quarter. Fortunately, group business remains strong and discounted leisure business has picked up the slack. With half of the year complete, our second half North America RevPAR guidance assumes economic growth remains on the same slow pace that we've seen year-to-date.
Second, with the stronger dollar, we are seeing fewer international guests coming to our U.S. hotels, with the impact most pronounced in a few key gateway markets. We estimate the number of room nights occupied by international guests at comparable hotels in New York and Miami declined by 10% to 15% in the second quarter. For the U.S. as a whole, the number of room nights from international guests in our hotels declined by roughly 3%.
Third, specific regional issues have had a meaningful impact on RevPAR growth: terrorism in Brussels, Paris and Istanbul; Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America; oil prices in Houston; and oil prices and unrest in the Middle East, to name a few. Combining the headwinds from the economy, foreign exchange and regional issues, Marriott's worldwide, system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 2.9% in the second quarter, just below our guidance. We were pleased with this performance because despite the environment, RevPAR index data shows that we are taking share. Our already high system-wide worldwide RevPAR index increased 90 basis points year-to-date, as we extended our lead over our competitive set.
We are also increasing our share of new development. Driven by the strength of our brands, we are already the largest hotel company in the world. Our global system totaled nearly 780,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter, and our worldwide pipeline increased to more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 15% higher than the year-ago quarter. 
In 2016, we expect our worldwide distribution, not including Starwood, will increase by roughly 7.5% gross or 6.5% net. According to STR, while Marriott has 11% of open rooms in the U.S. today, we have been selected to manage or franchise 30% of the rooms currently under construction, more than any other hotel brand company.
Our large pipeline is particularly impressive, given today's financing environment. New rules requiring banks to carry higher capital reserves have constrained lending, causing lenders to be more selective on both refinancings and new hotel construction. This selectivity includes more conservative loan-to-value ratios, a bias towards smaller transactions and caution about concentrated exposures in individual markets. To our benefit, lenders continue to favor the strongest brands.
While our business is cyclical, our cash flow is less sensitive than you might think. We estimate that 1 point of RevPAR worldwide over a full year moves our fee revenue by only about 1% or $25 million. And 1 point of RevPAR moves the net results of our owned and leased hotels by about $3 million. 
Meaningful unit growth and low-risk fee revenue yields terrific operating leverage. Our performance this quarter highlights the fact. Second quarter comparable worldwide actual dollar RevPAR increased 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
Our business throws off outstanding cash flow. We make -- we may make investments from time to time for particularly attractive management or franchise agreements on high-value hotels. We also buy and build great brands and businesses. We've added 5 brands in as many years, and the pending Starwood transaction will add another 11 brands. 
But if we can't find an attractive investment, we return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past 5 years, we have returned nearly $7.5 billion to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 130 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. We remain committed to minimizing owned assets and maximizing returns to shareholders. Our pretax return on invested capital was 50% in the second quarter.
Before I turn things over to Leeny, I'd like to say I am incredibly impressed with the people at Starwood. Despite the disruption and uncertainty they've experienced over the last 15 months, the Starwood team has done a great job, accelerating their development pipeline, spinning off Vistana, launching new marketing initiatives and opening nearly 125 hotels, all while also taking care of the guests and managing the everyday business. Thank you.
I'd also like to say that I have never been more proud of Marriott associates. This team has done a lot of transactions over the last 5 years, from the spinoff of Marriott Vacations Worldwide in 2011 to the more recent acquisitions of AC Hotels, Gaylord, Protea and Delta. With each of these transactions, Marriott associates worked hard to first execute the transaction and then capture the strategic value of the deal, all while growing and managing our existing business.
The Starwood transaction should be completed in the coming weeks, bringing these terrific teams together. Both the Marriott and Starwood teams have done exhaustive planning to get ready, and we are excited by our prospects. While we will see a lot of progress in the near term, we expect that full integration will be a 2-year project.
We are bullish about the power of the combined company. Starwood is known for its very strong brands, marketing know-how and outstanding Frequent Traveler program. Marriott has a proven track record in creating and growing leading brands, improving underperforming brands and expanding distribution. 
The combination of Marriott and Starwood should bring even more, including cost savings in G&A and hotel operations and revenue opportunities. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's great brands, and the ultimate combination of our rewards program and Starwood Preferred Guest will create the most compelling Frequent Traveler program in the industry by far.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Leeny to talk more about our second quarter results. Leeny?"

In the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.96, a 10% increase from the prior year. Adjusted for the Starwood transaction expenses, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.03, an 18% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS was about $0.04 to $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our fees were about $0.02 to $0.03 below those expectations due to weaker-than-expected RevPAR and lower-than-expected franchise relicensing fees. 
Our owned, leased and other line was about $0.01 shy of our expectations due to slightly lower-than-expected branding fees. G&A came in about $0.01 favorable to expectations. The joint venture line was $0.01 to $0.02 better than expected, largely due to strong hotel performance. Finally, our tax rate generated $0.05 to $0.06 of better-than-expected EPS due to some favorable discrete tax items.
Worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose roughly 3%. For our company-managed hotels, worldwide house profit margins increased 60 basis points. In North America, company-managed RevPAR rose 3.6% and house profit margins rose 100 basis points. House profit margins benefited from productivity gains and lower energy costs.
On a system-wide basis, North America system-wide RevPAR rose 3.2% in the quarter, with particular strength in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Atlanta. Transient RevPAR rose 2% in the quarter as we maintained occupancy by opening discount channel. Group RevPAR rose 7%, and catering sales increased more than 5% in the quarter. Overall, group cancellation rates remained normal and attendance at group meetings met our expectations. 
Group business continues to look solid for the second half of 2016, with system-wide North America group revenue pace up 5%, although the timing of holidays will influence quarterly comparisons. Third quarter system-wide group revenue pace in North America is up 9%, while fourth quarter pace is flat year-over-year. Encouragingly, 2017 group pace is up 7%.
Outside North America, second quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR rose 2% on a constant dollar basis or declined 1% using local currency. In Europe, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR increased 3%. Germany's RevPAR rose 9%, with strong group business. RevPAR in Spain rose at double-digit rate, benefiting from a stronger economy and large numbers of guests that would have visited hotels in the Middle East in the past. RevPAR in France, Belgium and Turkey remained very weak.
System-wide RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased nearly 6%. South Korea's RevPAR increased dramatically on easy comparison to last year's MERS outbreak. RevPAR in Greater China rose 3%, with very strong results in Shanghai and Beijing and modest growth in Hong Kong. Economic growth increased RevPAR in India by 10% in the quarter. 
We saw occupancy declines in the Caribbean and Latin America, largely due to weak economic conditions and the impact of the Zika virus. Occupancy rates were also lower in the Middle East and Africa region due to the earlier start of Ramadan, oversupply in Dubai, ongoing political unrest in many countries and the lower price of oil.
Total fee revenue in the second quarter increased 4%, with incentive fees up 16%. Base fees declined 3% due to a tough comparison to deferred fees recognized in the year-ago quarter and unfavorable FX rates. Franchise fees increased 6% despite $3 million less in lower -- in relicensing fees, reflecting fewer asset sales among our franchise community. 
Total incentive fees increased 16%, with North America hotels' incentive fees up 22%. Worldwide, 64% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 59% in the year-ago quarter. In North America alone, 62% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 55% in the year-ago quarter. 
Owned, leased and other revenues, net of direct expenses, increased 20% in the quarter, reflecting renovations at the Tokyo Ritz-Carlton and the Renaissance Jaragua, somewhat offset by the sale of our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton last year. In addition, results reflect an easy comparison to last year's preopening costs for the New York EDITION hotel.
Branding fees increased 14%, with higher cardholder sales from our co-branded credit cards and higher sales of Ritz-Carlton Residences. Reported general and administrative costs increased 11% or 1% when adjusted for the $14 million of Starwood-related transition and transaction costs in the second quarter. Reported operating margins totaled 10% for both the 2016 and 2015 quarters. Adjusting for cost reimbursement and Starwood transition and transaction costs, operating margins reached 53% in 2016 compared to 50% in the prior year in the second quarter.
Interest expense increased to $57 million in the second quarter. Excluding the $11 million cost of a bridge facility commitment, adjusted interest expense totaled $46 million. In preparation for the upcoming transaction, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt during the second quarter. The 5.5- and 10-year notes were priced at the lowest interest cost for comparable maturities in the company's history. These offerings increased our long-term debt to $4.1 billion, paid off our outstanding commercial paper balances and increased our cash and cash equivalents to nearly $700 million.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margins totaled 65%. Making an EPS projection for 2016 is difficult. To assist the modelers, however, we've provided some P&L guidance for Marriott's legacy business for the next 2 quarters. 
For the third quarter, we expect worldwide, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will increase 3% to 4%, benefiting from the favorable holiday pattern and the strong group bookings, including the Olympics in Brazil. Total fee revenue for the Marriott stand-alone business could total $495 million to $500 million, 6% to 8% growth over the 2015 third quarter. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to total $476 million to $481 million, a 10% to 12% growth over the prior year.
For the fourth quarter, we expect worldwide, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will moderate to a 2% to 3% increase, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons in North America. Total fee revenue for the Marriott stand-alone business could total $485 million to $490 million, a 7% to 8% growth over the 2015 fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to total $461 million to $471 million, a 15% to 17% increase over the prior year. We expect worldwide, system-wide RevPAR will increase roughly 3% for the full year 2016. Given our expected 6.5% worldwide net unit growth and modest increases in G&A, we anticipate that our legacy business will generate roughly $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year, 10% more than in 2015. We expect incentive fees to grow at a mid-teens rate.
Compared to our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA forecast from last quarter, our current adjusted EBITDA outlook is $36 million lower at the midpoint. With more modest RevPAR growth, some construction delays pushing hotel openings into early '17 and fewer asset sales among our franchise community, we've reduced our fee outlook by $40 million, including $10 million in lower franchise relicensing fees. 
Elsewhere on the P&L, we reduced our owned, leased and other net forecast a bit due to some fine-tuning of our branding fee estimate, while our new forecast for G&A is about $10 million better than our prior forecast. For the Marriott legacy business, 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. 
Excluding Starwood, we anticipate recycling $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments during '16. Given that transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we aren't including these costs in our 2016 guidance but expect to break out such expenses as actual results are reported, as we did this quarter. 
Like you, we rely on Starwood's publicly disclosed forecast of their RevPAR growth, unit growth and adjusted EBITDA for their business. When the transaction closes, we expect to assume Starwood's outstanding debt, issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increase net debt by roughly $3.5 billion for the cash component of the deal. Given we and Starwood are still 2 separate companies, we can't comment on the pace of Starwood's asset sales in 2016, but with the completion of the transaction, you can be sure we will be -- we will focus very quickly on getting back to our targeted leverage levels as quickly as possible.
With regard to future G&A spending, we expect to have our new organization largely in place by year-end 2016, although some transition costs will carry over into 2017 and even a bit into 2018 as we integrate our systems and technology platforms. We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million in steady state annual G&A savings. Once the transaction is complete, we will work to prepare 2015 and 2016 pro forma adjusted quarterly income statements to reflect the combination. These statements should be ready sometime this fall. We believe the transaction will close in the coming weeks. 
And now one more housekeeping matter for you. Our typical schedule for declaring a third quarter dividend is immediately following our August board meeting scheduled this year for next week, August 4. While we plan to pay a dividend in the third quarter, the announcement of the third quarter record and payment date may be delayed a bit until there's greater clarity around the actual transaction closing date. 
We appreciate your patience as we work through these issues and particularly appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Crystal, we'll take questions now."

I think as we guided a quarter ago, we have an overly rosy view about the strength of GDP in the United States, particularly. And as a consequence, we continue to stick with our 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the full year that we have provided at the beginning of the year. I think, today, we have obviously experienced actual second quarter number, which came in essentially right at the low end of our guidance in the United States and a little bit below the -- globally when you factor in some of what's happening around the world. And that, I think, is fundamentally a reflection of lower GDP growth in the United States than what we anticipated. But it is still positive GDP growth. I think, to some extent, the question you and we could ask of ourselves is, are we what, more solid, more confident in the kind of guidance we're giving today than what we gave a quarter ago? And I think the best answer to that is that we now are making forecasts based on essentially the current pace of GDP growth in the United States, which is weak, not on a more rosy scenario. Is it possible the U.S. economy performs worse than that? Of course, it is. But when you look at the range of economic data that comes out, including recent employment reports and consumer confidence reports and corporate profits and some of those sorts of things, it looks to us like it's a reasonably good bet that the economy will continue to grow, albeit grow maybe somewhat anemically. And there does not appear to be data out there which would suggest that it is getting meaningfully weaker from a GDP perspective. But that is the question to continue to keep your eye on."

The -- as we put out in the press release and the prepared remarks, we have seen really some construction pace expand. And I would think about Europe and North America as being primary examples of that. And that is about construction workers and supply and to some extent, maybe a little bit about how essential it is to get opened instantly. And I think in some respects, that in a somewhat weaker market, somewhat more anxious market, that allowing the construction to take a little longer is a rational thing that some of our partners are doing. And as a consequence, we see that the construction pace has expanded just a little bit. We are not seeing cancellations of projects, however. And I think generally, what we're talking about is projects that formerly we would have expected to open probably in the fourth quarter of the year, opening sometime in 2017. We've looked really hard at the incoming deals in our development pipeline. And I think we've been pleasantly surprised to see that new signings in most regions of the world are comparable, if not up a little bit, compared to the gangbuster year we had in 2015, including new deals signed in North America. And so we feel that actually it shows continued strong interest in growing with our brands and is not really a fundamental change, but is a bit of fine-tuning on whether we'll open before or after New Year's Eve."

The -- and often, we start the year with a 2-point range, and I think fairly, if you look back over the number of years we've been doing this, we probably keep a 2-point range longer than we should as the year progresses. We've thought about a 2-point range here. The fact of the matter is, to have a 2-point range at this stage of the year implies on the low end a much, much worse potential performance than we think is even potential. And on the high end, in many respects, requires us to envision a performance that is more optimistic than we think is really probable. And so as we went through this and you can see obviously, we give a full point range in our guidance for Q3 and then again for Q4, to some extent, you can do the math and see how that impacts it. In a sense, you could say that our roughly 3% is kind of like a 2.5% to 3.5%, which would be the more normal range to look at. But we think we should be fairly close to 3% as the year comes in, based on group and our present expectations about GDP growth."

I think we do continue to feel very comfortable that as quickly as we can, we will be back in the market. And whether that frankly happens to be towards the end of the Q4 or the beginning of Q1 does depend to some extent on exactly which deals close in the fourth quarter and first quarter.

The -- I'm not sure if I can answer that off the top of my head. I mean, I think the kind of pace we saw in the second quarter is more or less what we'd expect to take place over the balance of the year, with one significant clarification. And that is in part because of calendar timing and in part, simply because of the rhythms of group business. Group is meaningfully stronger in Q3 than in Q4, plus 10%-ish in Q3 and a flattish in Q4. Obviously, that puts us around plus 5% for the second half of the year as a whole. And so I would expect that we will see group be, when you combine those 2 quarters, a more powerful driver of RevPAR growth than transient business. Transient, of course, includes both corporate travel, mostly during the week and leisure travel mostly during the weekend. We would continue to expect that leisure travel is going to be stronger than business travel. And that business travel will be kind of flattish, maybe up 1 point -- 1 point or 2 depending on the way things go. I think if you wanted to be optimistic, you might say that we're bearing some of the consequences of the incredibly pessimistic mood that corporate America had as 2016 began, think about our perspectives in the first quarter. And that's maybe a little bit of a lingering impact. And if there is -- because of the economic data that's coming out or corporate profits or other things, a little bit less anxiety going forward, maybe we could see that improve a little bit. But again, we're essentially forecasting a kind of steady-state weak corporate transient demand, not falling off a cliff in any respect but just sort of continuing to bump along."

The -- we are -- I know one of our principal competitors talked about this yesterday in their call. They were a couple of months, maybe 3 months ahead of us, particularly in the marketing of their programs, but their data has got a few months head start for us. But I think what we're seeing in our Marriott Rewards member-only rates is very encouraging. We continue to see strong year-over-year growth in Marriott Rewards sign-ups. We see that the occupancy contribution from the rewards program is in the high 50s% of contribution to the hotels. We see strong growth in apps download and marriott.com business and mobile bookings and all those things, so we're encouraged by that. It has had a modest impact, we think, on RevPAR in Q2, probably in the 30 to 40 basis point range on reported RevPAR, which, in a sense, you could look at and say, that's, what, that is a negative impact of it, but this is a long-term question for us. And really, what we want to make sure we're doing is communicating clearly to our Marriott Rewards members that they will have value because we know them and because they have loyalty to us and make it crystal clear, sometimes contrary to the advertising or perception that's out there in the market, but make it crystal clear that the rates through our channels are at least as good, if not better, than the rates that are available anywhere else. And obviously, if that drives a meaningful share shift towards our channels, that's a good thing, and that's the bet we're making and we think it's a good bet."

And so, really not just kind of adding necessarily before the merger where we have an opportunity to do it afterwards and do it in combination with the reorganization of how we want to run the company on a combined basis. So I think, overall, these are good, solid. The $10 million that you've seen is what I would call a permanent sort of solid reduction in G&A relative to cost controls. And I don't think we are imagining that there is -- with the current standalone Marriott business, that we would be imagining that we're looking at an environment of needing to do a wholesale reorganization.

Certainly, in the group space, if you've got a shrinkage that is occurring sort of real-time so that groups are showing up with meaningfully lower numbers than what they anticipated before, that could be a warning that group participants or the company sponsoring groups are less bullish about things than they were when the reservation group booking was first made. But again, we haven't really seen movement in that. So there's not data there that would tell us to beware because of that. In fact, you can tell from our comments about group, group is one of those things that we look at that give us solidity in our point of view about the future. And the group attendance has been good, and the food and beverage spending has been good, and so that's sort of reassuring. It's a good question around transient cancellation.

In terms of loyalty, we've got a host of issues in addition to both the technological issues around platforms and reservations, et cetera. We've also got some other things like credit cards and timeshare businesses where we need to work with our partners to get where we all want to go in terms of the relationship with the customer.

We think we've got about 11% of the rooms in the United States and a smaller share in the rest of the world, usually dramatically smaller than that 11%. We tend to run meaningfully higher rates than the market as a whole and we obviously do that with a purpose. That's partly because of the way our hotels are skewed in terms of their level of luxury and level of services, and that's partly about simply our approach to pricing. So there is lots of business out there that is more rate-sensitive and can be pursued by us if we think it is in our interest to pursue it. Obviously, we're also adding new units around the world. And whether that's at 6.5% or 7%, it is meaningful growth into our system. And so we are, with those new hotels, making sure we can also grab new customers in order to fill them and do what we need to do. And the performance there has been great. And so I think there is plenty of business for us to continue to go and grab. I think that business cannot always be grabbed at exactly the rates that -- the highest rate of business we have in the hotels. But we do our best through revenue management and mix management and the like to drive optimal performance. And I think we've done well with that. Obviously, that's a top line focus sort of number. I would -- let me stress something on the bottom line, too, and maybe brag about it a little bit. But I think the 100 basis point improvement in margins in the managed portfolio in the United States in a 3% RevPAR growth environment is extraordinarily impressive. And that is a bit about good management at the top line but it's also great management of the cost elements of those hotels. And both of those things, I think, tell you that we've got tools that we can use even in this sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we're experiencing today that can cause us to deliver. Yes, maybe it's low-ish single-digit RevPAR growth, but when you put unit growth and cost management and capital return to shareholders into the equation, you end up with this high teens or maybe even better EPS growth, 18% EPS growth in Q2. And that's with $20 million less in gains on asset sales because we had that in Q2 of 2015."

And if anything, that understates China's performance.

We obviously read the same newspapers that you do, and there is some anxiety there as there is in many other markets around the world, but it seems that people are continuing to move forward with projects that have strength. And then, on the negative side, Hong Kong has been sort of tougher market mostly because Chinese visitation has -- Mainland Chinese visitation has declined. Some of that is currency-driven, given that Hong Kong's dollar is essentially pegged to the U.S. dollar, and so as a consequence, has become more expensive as the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate around the world. We wouldn't expect that Hong -- the story in Hong Kong is going to change for the better anytime real soon. But it's -- Thailand's strong, too, but I think, across the region generally, we're pretty bullish about Asia Pacific."

We've got a great breadth and depth now with greater international exposure across our portfolio where it's not quite the same in terms of the falloff. I think as long as we're staying in the kind of ballparks that we've talked about for RevPAR without a meaningful change, I think we're in the right spot, and you've got the right kinds of numbers. We aren't seeing that we automatically would have to kind of imagine that you -- all of a sudden, you're going to go back and reverse the ones that you have. We've got a large portfolio of limited service hotels that added nicely to incentive fees in Q2, and their performance looks to continue to be strong. So it's -- IMF performance was really nice and broad, both in North America as well as internationally, obviously impacted by some tough international markets, but overall, kind of strong growth overall. The other thing I would say on our IMFs is that as you think about where we are from a margin perspective, this performance is really top-notch in terms of the kinds of IMF growth that we're having relative to the RevPAR growth that's really great performance. And we feel great about the rest of the year in that regard."

My guess is that often the way this works is if Q3, for example, were plus 10 or plus 9 point something in group business, we're more likely to end up with a group number which is a bit lower than that when the dust settles because there's not likely to be availability to take as much in the quarter, for the quarter group business as we probably took last year. The opposite may be the case for the fourth quarter though. So the fourth quarter hopefully will end up with actual group RevPAR numbers which are better than 0.

Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. 
Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. 
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 28, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
The big news this year for Marriott is the Starwood acquisition. As you know, we have received all of the necessary regulatory clearances throughout the world, with the exception of China. We are in the second phase of China review and have been working cooperatively with the regulatory authorities. Phase 2 review ends on August 9. We remain optimistic that we will receive clearance from China and will complete the transaction in the coming weeks. 
Before we move to specifics, let me make 3 observations about our results in the quarter. First, you will not be surprised that U.S. economic growth has been slower than we anticipated when the year began. In fact, over the last 3 quarters, room sales of our nearly 300 largest corporate customers have gradually weakened, from 4% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 2% in the first quarter and less than 1% in the second quarter. Fortunately, group business remains strong and discounted leisure business has picked up the slack. With half of the year complete, our second half North America RevPAR guidance assumes economic growth remains on the same slow pace that we've seen year-to-date.
Second, with the stronger dollar, we are seeing fewer international guests coming to our U.S. hotels, with the impact most pronounced in a few key gateway markets. We estimate the number of room nights occupied by international guests at comparable hotels in New York and Miami declined by 10% to 15% in the second quarter. For the U.S. as a whole, the number of room nights from international guests in our hotels declined by roughly 3%.
Third, specific regional issues have had a meaningful impact on RevPAR growth: terrorism in Brussels, Paris and Istanbul; Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America; oil prices in Houston; and oil prices and unrest in the Middle East, to name a few. Combining the headwinds from the economy, foreign exchange and regional issues, Marriott's worldwide, system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 2.9% in the second quarter, just below our guidance. We were pleased with this performance because despite the environment, RevPAR index data shows that we are taking share. Our already high system-wide worldwide RevPAR index increased 90 basis points year-to-date, as we extended our lead over our competitive set.
We are also increasing our share of new development. Driven by the strength of our brands, we are already the largest hotel company in the world. Our global system totaled nearly 780,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter, and our worldwide pipeline increased to more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 15% higher than the year-ago quarter. 
In 2016, we expect our worldwide distribution, not including Starwood, will increase by roughly 7.5% gross or 6.5% net. According to STR, while Marriott has 11% of open rooms in the U.S. today, we have been selected to manage or franchise 30% of the rooms currently under construction, more than any other hotel brand company.
Our large pipeline is particularly impressive, given today's financing environment. New rules requiring banks to carry higher capital reserves have constrained lending, causing lenders to be more selective on both refinancings and new hotel construction. This selectivity includes more conservative loan-to-value ratios, a bias towards smaller transactions and caution about concentrated exposures in individual markets. To our benefit, lenders continue to favor the strongest brands.
While our business is cyclical, our cash flow is less sensitive than you might think. We estimate that 1 point of RevPAR worldwide over a full year moves our fee revenue by only about 1% or $25 million. And 1 point of RevPAR moves the net results of our owned and leased hotels by about $3 million. 
Meaningful unit growth and low-risk fee revenue yields terrific operating leverage. Our performance this quarter highlights the fact. Second quarter comparable worldwide actual dollar RevPAR increased 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
Our business throws off outstanding cash flow. We make -- we may make investments from time to time for particularly attractive management or franchise agreements on high-value hotels. We also buy and build great brands and businesses. We've added 5 brands in as many years, and the pending Starwood transaction will add another 11 brands. 
But if we can't find an attractive investment, we return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past 5 years, we have returned nearly $7.5 billion to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 130 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. We remain committed to minimizing owned assets and maximizing returns to shareholders. Our pretax return on invested capital was 50% in the second quarter.
Before I turn things over to Leeny, I'd like to say I am incredibly impressed with the people at Starwood. Despite the disruption and uncertainty they've experienced over the last 15 months, the Starwood team has done a great job, accelerating their development pipeline, spinning off Vistana, launching new marketing initiatives and opening nearly 125 hotels, all while also taking care of the guests and managing the everyday business. Thank you.
I'd also like to say that I have never been more proud of Marriott associates. This team has done a lot of transactions over the last 5 years, from the spinoff of Marriott Vacations Worldwide in 2011 to the more recent acquisitions of AC Hotels, Gaylord, Protea and Delta. With each of these transactions, Marriott associates worked hard to first execute the transaction and then capture the strategic value of the deal, all while growing and managing our existing business.
The Starwood transaction should be completed in the coming weeks, bringing these terrific teams together. Both the Marriott and Starwood teams have done exhaustive planning to get ready, and we are excited by our prospects. While we will see a lot of progress in the near term, we expect that full integration will be a 2-year project.
We are bullish about the power of the combined company. Starwood is known for its very strong brands, marketing know-how and outstanding Frequent Traveler program. Marriott has a proven track record in creating and growing leading brands, improving underperforming brands and expanding distribution. 
The combination of Marriott and Starwood should bring even more, including cost savings in G&A and hotel operations and revenue opportunities. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's great brands, and the ultimate combination of our rewards program and Starwood Preferred Guest will create the most compelling Frequent Traveler program in the industry by far.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Leeny to talk more about our second quarter results. Leeny?"

In the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.96, a 10% increase from the prior year. Adjusted for the Starwood transaction expenses, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.03, an 18% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS was about $0.04 to $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our fees were about $0.02 to $0.03 below those expectations due to weaker-than-expected RevPAR and lower-than-expected franchise relicensing fees. 
Our owned, leased and other line was about $0.01 shy of our expectations due to slightly lower-than-expected branding fees. G&A came in about $0.01 favorable to expectations. The joint venture line was $0.01 to $0.02 better than expected, largely due to strong hotel performance. Finally, our tax rate generated $0.05 to $0.06 of better-than-expected EPS due to some favorable discrete tax items.
Worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose roughly 3%. For our company-managed hotels, worldwide house profit margins increased 60 basis points. In North America, company-managed RevPAR rose 3.6% and house profit margins rose 100 basis points. House profit margins benefited from productivity gains and lower energy costs.
On a system-wide basis, North America system-wide RevPAR rose 3.2% in the quarter, with particular strength in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Atlanta. Transient RevPAR rose 2% in the quarter as we maintained occupancy by opening discount channel. Group RevPAR rose 7%, and catering sales increased more than 5% in the quarter. Overall, group cancellation rates remained normal and attendance at group meetings met our expectations. 
Group business continues to look solid for the second half of 2016, with system-wide North America group revenue pace up 5%, although the timing of holidays will influence quarterly comparisons. Third quarter system-wide group revenue pace in North America is up 9%, while fourth quarter pace is flat year-over-year. Encouragingly, 2017 group pace is up 7%.
Outside North America, second quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR rose 2% on a constant dollar basis or declined 1% using local currency. In Europe, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR increased 3%. Germany's RevPAR rose 9%, with strong group business. RevPAR in Spain rose at double-digit rate, benefiting from a stronger economy and large numbers of guests that would have visited hotels in the Middle East in the past. RevPAR in France, Belgium and Turkey remained very weak.
System-wide RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased nearly 6%. South Korea's RevPAR increased dramatically on easy comparison to last year's MERS outbreak. RevPAR in Greater China rose 3%, with very strong results in Shanghai and Beijing and modest growth in Hong Kong. Economic growth increased RevPAR in India by 10% in the quarter. 
We saw occupancy declines in the Caribbean and Latin America, largely due to weak economic conditions and the impact of the Zika virus. Occupancy rates were also lower in the Middle East and Africa region due to the earlier start of Ramadan, oversupply in Dubai, ongoing political unrest in many countries and the lower price of oil.
Total fee revenue in the second quarter increased 4%, with incentive fees up 16%. Base fees declined 3% due to a tough comparison to deferred fees recognized in the year-ago quarter and unfavorable FX rates. Franchise fees increased 6% despite $3 million less in lower -- in relicensing fees, reflecting fewer asset sales among our franchise community. 
Total incentive fees increased 16%, with North America hotels' incentive fees up 22%. Worldwide, 64% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 59% in the year-ago quarter. In North America alone, 62% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 55% in the year-ago quarter. 
Owned, leased and other revenues, net of direct expenses, increased 20% in the quarter, reflecting renovations at the Tokyo Ritz-Carlton and the Renaissance Jaragua, somewhat offset by the sale of our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton last year. In addition, results reflect an easy comparison to last year's preopening costs for the New York EDITION hotel.
Branding fees increased 14%, with higher cardholder sales from our co-branded credit cards and higher sales of Ritz-Carlton Residences. Reported general and administrative costs increased 11% or 1% when adjusted for the $14 million of Starwood-related transition and transaction costs in the second quarter. Reported operating margins totaled 10% for both the 2016 and 2015 quarters. Adjusting for cost reimbursement and Starwood transition and transaction costs, operating margins reached 53% in 2016 compared to 50% in the prior year in the second quarter.
Interest expense increased to $57 million in the second quarter. Excluding the $11 million cost of a bridge facility commitment, adjusted interest expense totaled $46 million. In preparation for the upcoming transaction, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt during the second quarter. The 5.5- and 10-year notes were priced at the lowest interest cost for comparable maturities in the company's history. These offerings increased our long-term debt to $4.1 billion, paid off our outstanding commercial paper balances and increased our cash and cash equivalents to nearly $700 million.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margins totaled 65%. Making an EPS projection for 2016 is difficult. To assist the modelers, however, we've provided some P&L guidance for Marriott's legacy business for the next 2 quarters. 
For the third quarter, we expect worldwide, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will increase 3% to 4%, benefiting from the favorable holiday pattern and the strong group bookings, including the Olympics in Brazil. Total fee revenue for the Marriott stand-alone business could total $495 million to $500 million, 6% to 8% growth over the 2015 third quarter. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to total $476 million to $481 million, a 10% to 12% growth over the prior year.
For the fourth quarter, we expect worldwide, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR will moderate to a 2% to 3% increase, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons in North America. Total fee revenue for the Marriott stand-alone business could total $485 million to $490 million, a 7% to 8% growth over the 2015 fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to total $461 million to $471 million, a 15% to 17% increase over the prior year. We expect worldwide, system-wide RevPAR will increase roughly 3% for the full year 2016. Given our expected 6.5% worldwide net unit growth and modest increases in G&A, we anticipate that our legacy business will generate roughly $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year, 10% more than in 2015. We expect incentive fees to grow at a mid-teens rate.
Compared to our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA forecast from last quarter, our current adjusted EBITDA outlook is $36 million lower at the midpoint. With more modest RevPAR growth, some construction delays pushing hotel openings into early '17 and fewer asset sales among our franchise community, we've reduced our fee outlook by $40 million, including $10 million in lower franchise relicensing fees. 
Elsewhere on the P&L, we reduced our owned, leased and other net forecast a bit due to some fine-tuning of our branding fee estimate, while our new forecast for G&A is about $10 million better than our prior forecast. For the Marriott legacy business, 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. 
Excluding Starwood, we anticipate recycling $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments during '16. Given that transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we aren't including these costs in our 2016 guidance but expect to break out such expenses as actual results are reported, as we did this quarter. 
Like you, we rely on Starwood's publicly disclosed forecast of their RevPAR growth, unit growth and adjusted EBITDA for their business. When the transaction closes, we expect to assume Starwood's outstanding debt, issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increase net debt by roughly $3.5 billion for the cash component of the deal. Given we and Starwood are still 2 separate companies, we can't comment on the pace of Starwood's asset sales in 2016, but with the completion of the transaction, you can be sure we will be -- we will focus very quickly on getting back to our targeted leverage levels as quickly as possible.
With regard to future G&A spending, we expect to have our new organization largely in place by year-end 2016, although some transition costs will carry over into 2017 and even a bit into 2018 as we integrate our systems and technology platforms. We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million in steady state annual G&A savings. Once the transaction is complete, we will work to prepare 2015 and 2016 pro forma adjusted quarterly income statements to reflect the combination. These statements should be ready sometime this fall. We believe the transaction will close in the coming weeks. 
And now one more housekeeping matter for you. Our typical schedule for declaring a third quarter dividend is immediately following our August board meeting scheduled this year for next week, August 4. While we plan to pay a dividend in the third quarter, the announcement of the third quarter record and payment date may be delayed a bit until there's greater clarity around the actual transaction closing date. 
We appreciate your patience as we work through these issues and particularly appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Crystal, we'll take questions now."

I think as we guided a quarter ago, we have an overly rosy view about the strength of GDP in the United States, particularly. And as a consequence, we continue to stick with our 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the full year that we have provided at the beginning of the year. I think, today, we have obviously experienced actual second quarter number, which came in essentially right at the low end of our guidance in the United States and a little bit below the -- globally when you factor in some of what's happening around the world. And that, I think, is fundamentally a reflection of lower GDP growth in the United States than what we anticipated. But it is still positive GDP growth. I think, to some extent, the question you and we could ask of ourselves is, are we what, more solid, more confident in the kind of guidance we're giving today than what we gave a quarter ago? And I think the best answer to that is that we now are making forecasts based on essentially the current pace of GDP growth in the United States, which is weak, not on a more rosy scenario. Is it possible the U.S. economy performs worse than that? Of course, it is. But when you look at the range of economic data that comes out, including recent employment reports and consumer confidence reports and corporate profits and some of those sorts of things, it looks to us like it's a reasonably good bet that the economy will continue to grow, albeit grow maybe somewhat anemically. And there does not appear to be data out there which would suggest that it is getting meaningfully weaker from a GDP perspective. But that is the question to continue to keep your eye on."

And I think in some respects, that in a somewhat weaker market, somewhat more anxious market, that allowing the construction to take a little longer is a rational thing that some of our partners are doing. And as a consequence, we see that the construction pace has expanded just a little bit. We are not seeing cancellations of projects, however. And I think generally, what we're talking about is projects that formerly we would have expected to open probably in the fourth quarter of the year, opening sometime in 2017. We've looked really hard at the incoming deals in our development pipeline. And I think we've been pleasantly surprised to see that new signings in most regions of the world are comparable, if not up a little bit, compared to the gangbuster year we had in 2015, including new deals signed in North America. And so we feel that actually it shows continued strong interest in growing with our brands and is not really a fundamental change, but is a bit of fine-tuning on whether we'll open before or after New Year's Eve."

We've thought about a 2-point range here. The fact of the matter is, to have a 2-point range at this stage of the year implies on the low end a much, much worse potential performance than we think is even potential. And on the high end, in many respects, requires us to envision a performance that is more optimistic than we think is really probable. And so as we went through this and you can see obviously, we give a full point range in our guidance for Q3 and then again for Q4, to some extent, you can do the math and see how that impacts it. In a sense, you could say that our roughly 3% is kind of like a 2.5% to 3.5%, which would be the more normal range to look at. But we think we should be fairly close to 3% as the year comes in, based on group and our present expectations about GDP growth."

I think we do continue to feel very comfortable that as quickly as we can, we will be back in the market. And whether that frankly happens to be towards the end of the Q4 or the beginning of Q1 does depend to some extent on exactly which deals close in the fourth quarter and first quarter.

I mean, I think the kind of pace we saw in the second quarter is more or less what we'd expect to take place over the balance of the year, with one significant clarification. And that is in part because of calendar timing and in part, simply because of the rhythms of group business. Group is meaningfully stronger in Q3 than in Q4, plus 10%-ish in Q3 and a flattish in Q4. Obviously, that puts us around plus 5% for the second half of the year as a whole. And so I would expect that we will see group be, when you combine those 2 quarters, a more powerful driver of RevPAR growth than transient business. Transient, of course, includes both corporate travel, mostly during the week and leisure travel mostly during the weekend. We would continue to expect that leisure travel is going to be stronger than business travel. And that business travel will be kind of flattish, maybe up 1 point -- 1 point or 2 depending on the way things go. I think if you wanted to be optimistic, you might say that we're bearing some of the consequences of the incredibly pessimistic mood that corporate America had as 2016 began, think about our perspectives in the first quarter. And that's maybe a little bit of a lingering impact. And if there is -- because of the economic data that's coming out or corporate profits or other things, a little bit less anxiety going forward, maybe we could see that improve a little bit. But again, we're essentially forecasting a kind of steady-state weak corporate transient demand, not falling off a cliff in any respect but just sort of continuing to bump along."

And I think that's driven by that aspect of our economy. The comparisons will get easier for oil, certainly, as the year goes along.

The -- we are -- I know one of our principal competitors talked about this yesterday in their call. They were a couple of months, maybe 3 months ahead of us, particularly in the marketing of their programs, but their data has got a few months head start for us. But I think what we're seeing in our Marriott Rewards member-only rates is very encouraging. We continue to see strong year-over-year growth in Marriott Rewards sign-ups. We see that the occupancy contribution from the rewards program is in the high 50s% of contribution to the hotels. We see strong growth in apps download and marriott.com business and mobile bookings and all those things, so we're encouraged by that. It has had a modest impact, we think, on RevPAR in Q2, probably in the 30 to 40 basis point range on reported RevPAR, which, in a sense, you could look at and say, that's, what, that is a negative impact of it, but this is a long-term question for us. And really, what we want to make sure we're doing is communicating clearly to our Marriott Rewards members that they will have value because we know them and because they have loyalty to us and make it crystal clear, sometimes contrary to the advertising or perception that's out there in the market, but make it crystal clear that the rates through our channels are at least as good, if not better, than the rates that are available anywhere else. And obviously, if that drives a meaningful share shift towards our channels, that's a good thing, and that's the bet we're making and we think it's a good bet."

And so, really not just kind of adding necessarily before the merger where we have an opportunity to do it afterwards and do it in combination with the reorganization of how we want to run the company on a combined basis. So I think, overall, these are good, solid. The $10 million that you've seen is what I would call a permanent sort of solid reduction in G&A relative to cost controls. And I don't think we are imagining that there is -- with the current standalone Marriott business, that we would be imagining that we're looking at an environment of needing to do a wholesale reorganization.

Certainly, in the group space, if you've got a shrinkage that is occurring sort of real-time so that groups are showing up with meaningfully lower numbers than what they anticipated before, that could be a warning that group participants or the company sponsoring groups are less bullish about things than they were when the reservation group booking was first made. But again, we haven't really seen movement in that. So there's not data there that would tell us to beware because of that. In fact, you can tell from our comments about group, group is one of those things that we look at that give us solidity in our point of view about the future. And the group attendance has been good, and the food and beverage spending has been good, and so that's sort of reassuring. It's a good question around transient cancellation.

This integration of these 2 companies, when you think about it, kind of what we got to do, get in there, look at it and then figure out from a transition standpoint that it is a 2-year integration is definitely something that you should expect. In terms of loyalty, we've got a host of issues in addition to both the technological issues around platforms and reservations, et cetera. We've also got some other things like credit cards and timeshare businesses where we need to work with our partners to get where we all want to go in terms of the relationship with the customer.

We think we've got about 11% of the rooms in the United States and a smaller share in the rest of the world, usually dramatically smaller than that",431,"Yes, the -- there is lots of business out there that we don't have in our hotels by definition, obviously. We think we've got about 11% of the rooms in the United States and a smaller share in the rest of the world, usually dramatically smaller than that 11%. We tend to run meaningfully higher rates than the market as a whole and we obviously do that with a purpose. That's partly because of the way our hotels are skewed in terms of their level of luxury and level of services, and that's partly about simply our approach to pricing. So there is lots of business out there that is more rate-sensitive and can be pursued by us if we think it is in our interest to pursue it. Obviously, we're also adding new units around the world. And whether that's at 6.5% or 7%, it is meaningful growth into our system. And so we are, with those new hotels, making sure we can also grab new customers in order to fill them and do what we need to do. And the performance there has been great. And so I think there is plenty of business for us to continue to go and grab. I think that business cannot always be grabbed at exactly the rates that -- the highest rate of business we have in the hotels. But we do our best through revenue management and mix management and the like to drive optimal performance. And I think we've done well with that. Obviously, that's a top line focus sort of number. I would -- let me stress something on the bottom line, too, and maybe brag about it a little bit. But I think the 100 basis point improvement in margins in the managed portfolio in the United States in a 3% RevPAR growth environment is extraordinarily impressive. And that is a bit about good management at the top line but it's also great management of the cost elements of those hotels. And both of those things, I think, tell you that we've got tools that we can use even in this sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we're experiencing today that can cause us to deliver. Yes, maybe it's low-ish single-digit RevPAR growth, but when you put unit growth and cost management and capital return to shareholders into the equation, you end up with this high teens or maybe even better EPS growth, 18% EPS growth in Q2. And that's with $20 million less in gains on asset sales because we had that in Q2 of 2015."

And of course, we believe our brands are in first demand and we've got data to support that. But I think there is a significant shift towards quality. I think that shift, in many respects, accelerates when there's more anxiety in the market and whether that anxiety is manifested by the way the equity investor approaches it or by the approach that the lender takes. And we obviously talked about that a little bit in the prepared comments. Lenders are more cautious today. And that caution is also going to force them to put their borrowers in a position where they're going with the strongest brands that pose the least risk in a weaker environment.

In other markets, we may have a Marriott that is competing against a limited service hotel because that's the only other hotel in the market, or some other products like that or some independent hotels. And all of these get rolled up, and when we talk about 90 basis points of index growth, that is a collection of taking from lots of different kinds of competitors."

You can look at it for our total RevPAR numbers that we reported in the quarter. We obviously called out a number of the individual markets. But you look across the region and see, more often than not, good, strong performance. Sometimes, in markets like South Korea, that is aided by an extraordinarily easy comparison because of the MERS crisis last year. But you look at India with its 10% RevPAR growth, that is driven by core economic growth in the country. China, we talked about, with Mainland China RevPAR up about 3% in Q2. And if anything, that understates China's performance. We did have a shift in the way we report RevPAR year-over-year, which has something to do with service fees and service charges and some other fine-tuning event, which has about a 2-point impact on reported RevPAR in China in the quarter. And so, if anything, China is doing even better than the numbers that we reported. We've been pleased with China on the development side year-to-date. We obviously read the same newspapers that you do, and there is some anxiety there as there is in many other markets around the world, but it seems that people are continuing to move forward with projects that have strength. And then, on the negative side, Hong Kong has been sort of tougher market mostly because Chinese visitation has -- Mainland Chinese visitation has declined. Some of that is currency-driven, given that Hong Kong's dollar is essentially pegged to the U.S. dollar, and so as a consequence, has become more expensive as the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate around the world. We wouldn't expect that Hong -- the story in Hong Kong is going to change for the better anytime real soon. But it's -- Thailand's strong, too, but I think, across the region generally, we're pretty bullish about Asia Pacific."

We aren't seeing that we automatically would have to kind of imagine that you -- all of a sudden, you're going to go back and reverse the ones that you have.

So it's -- IMF performance was really nice and broad, both in North America as well as internationally, obviously impacted by some tough international markets, but overall, kind of strong growth overall. The other thing I would say on our IMFs is that as you think about where we are from a margin perspective, this performance is really top-notch in terms of the kinds of IMF growth that we're having relative to the RevPAR growth that's really great performance.

My guess is that often the way this works is if Q3, for example, were plus 10 or plus 9 point something in group business, we're more likely to end up with a group number which is a bit lower than that when the dust settles because there's not likely to be availability to take as much in the quarter, for the quarter group business as we probably took last year. The opposite may be the case for the fourth quarter though. So the fourth quarter hopefully will end up with actual group RevPAR numbers which are better than 0.

Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, November 8, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
There are several topics we want to cover today, including our third quarter financial results, third quarter business trends, fourth quarter guidance and our early look into 2017. But first, we want to talk about the Starwood acquisition and the integration.
This is the first earnings call for the new Marriott International. On September 23, we completed the most transformational transaction in the company's history. Including the pipeline, our global system encompasses nearly 1.6 million guestrooms today.
Our near-term priorities are straight forward. We talked to associates to net the company together culturally, seize as soon as possible top line synergies, property cost efficiencies and $250 million in G&A savings, and do all this while remaining focused on our ongoing business, providing great experiences for our guests and driving returns for our owners and franchisees.
Off to a fast start, our team did what no other large consumer company has accomplished. Within minutes after the merger closed, we linked 3 enormous loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest, further announcing that we would match member status between the programs. We immediately enabled our loyal travelers to earn points in one program and redeem in the other. In fact, over 3.3 billion points were transferred between the programs in the first month alone, while the first transfer and redemption reservation occurred just 15 minutes after we closed the transaction.
That effort did not go unnoticed by customers and commentators. Blogger Gary Leff, who writes View from the Wing, noted to his readers that, ""No program has ever set up a mechanism to link accounts this quickly."" And my favorite quote came from a loyalty member who tweeted, ""Don't know if I'm more excited about linking Marriott Rewards or the fact that pumpkin spiced lattes are back.""
Doing the loyalty programs right has been a big priority for us since the deal was announced. Today, we are pleased to confirm that only 16% of our combined 85 million members were members of both programs prior to the merger. This puts us in a tremendous position to capture incremental business.
Immediately after closing, we also reached out to our largest B2B customers to tell them the great news and to begin cross-selling across our 30 brands. For our group business, we have seen over 1,000 lead referrals through the end of October between the Starwood and Marriott portfolios.
We are moving quickly to reduce costs, both in G&A as well as costs for our hotels. Procurement is a near-term opportunity. Starwood-managed hotels will begin transitioning to Avendra, the purchasing platform used by Legacy-Marriott Hotels and many other companies, in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Next year, we should see savings on OTA contracts. With its greater scale, Marriott has historically been able to obtain more attractive OTA contract terms. While savings to Starwood Hotels will vary by region, applying Marriott's contract terms should save Starwood owners OTA commissions, even assuming no change in OTA usage, with more savings expected in 2018.
We know that you are anxious to hear much more about our integration strategy and synergy opportunities, but let us ask you for your patience. The hotel business is about the details. Every market is different and every property is different. We can tell you we've reviewed and assimilated a tremendous amount of information from Starwood over the last 6 weeks and that we remain as enthusiastic about the transaction as ever.
While the deal is very exciting, we are also focused on business fundamentals. While reported third quarter financial results included only 8 days of Starwood results, today's outlook is drawn from an analysis of operating trends at both companies for all 3 months of the quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2017 reflects the combined company.
Clearly, North American demand continues -- demand growth continues to moderate. In the third quarter, hotels with the weakest RevPAR were generally in oil and gas markets or in gateway cities affected by continued weak international visitation or impacted by new supply. In the quarter, both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood portfolios did well in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Toronto and Washington, D.C., while both portfolios saw RevPAR declines in Houston, New York and San Francisco. On a combined basis, North America company-operated group RevPAR increased nearly 7%, benefiting from strong demand and a favorable holiday comparison.
Catering revenue continues to be strong. New group business is encouraging too. In the third quarter alone, Marriott and Starwood's sales organizations booked a combined 3.6 million room nights for future periods. Measured by booked group revenue, the 2 companies booked 6% more business than in the prior year, with particular strength for stays in 2018 and beyond.
In contrast, corporate customers are clearly cautious. In our last earnings call, we mentioned a trend in room sales among Legacy-Marriott's largest 300 corporate customers in North America, from 4% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2% in the first quarter to less than 1% growth in the second quarter. For this quarter, room revenue from Legacy-Marriott's top 300 customers was flat year-over-year as higher demand from professional services, retail and health care firms was offset by lower demand from technology, financial, energy and manufacturing companies.
Looking ahead in North America, fourth quarter group RevPAR pace for our company-operated Marriott and Starwood full-service hotels is down about 5%, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons combined with weak near-term corporate bookings. With greater availability, transient business should improve year-over-year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR for the combined system-wide Marriott and Starwood portfolios in North America will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Outside the U.S., third quarter performance of the Marriott and Starwood brands was very similar when adjusting for differences in geographic distribution. Across both portfolios in the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR growth was very strong in Brazil and Mexico, but was constrained by Zika in the Caribbean, weak economic growth in South America and new supply in Central America. For the fourth quarter, we expect Zika will continue to be a problem for the combined portfolio. And without the Olympics, we expect Brazil hotels will more acutely feel the effect of their weak economy. As a result, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our hotels in the region will be flattish with the prior year.
In the Middle East and Africa, easy Ramadan comparisons took Marriott and Starwood RevPAR higher in the third quarter, along with greater leisure business in South Africa and strong regional demand in Cairo. At the same time, many oil markets remained weak. Without the benefit of a holiday shift, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our combined portfolio in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate.
In the Asia Pacific region, Marriott and Starwood saw third quarter RevPAR improvement in India, South Korea and Shanghai, with declines in the Maldives, Macau and tertiary markets in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio should be flattish year-over-year, constrained by the cancellations that followed the death of the king in Thailand. 
In Europe, Marriott and Starwood occupancy in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul was weak in the third quarter, while our U.K. properties welcomed a greater number of Middle East travelers in the quarter. Hotels in Poland, Russia and Spain reported strong RevPAR growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio to be flattish year-over-year due to lingering terrorism concerns, weak group pace in London, Paris and Amsterdam and tougher comparisons in Poland and Russia.
Bottom line, we expect worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead to 2017, our North America outlook assumes a steady-as-she-goes economy and modestly higher supply growth. For the 2017 full year, North America revenue group pace for company-operated full-service hotels across the Marriott and Starwood portfolios is currently up about 2%.
For transient business, we expect current weak corporate demand to persist, although comparisons should get easier. We are targeting a higher volume of special corporate rate business for the coming year and expect special corporate room rates for comparable customers to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in most markets.
We are aggressively marketing to leisure guests and adding contract business at attractive rates. As a result, for 2017, we expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, North American fee revenue from the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 70% of worldwide fee revenue.
Outside North America in 2017, we expect incremental constant dollar system-wide RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America regions should also be flat to up 2%, reflecting good performance in Mexico and Central America. In 2015, Caribbean and Latin America pro forma fee revenue from the Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 4% of worldwide total fee revenue.
For the Middle East and Africa region, South Africa and Cairo should be strong, but we also see continued weak oil markets and risk of political disruption. As a result, we believe RevPAR will be flattish in the region in 2017. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Marriott's and Starwood's Middle East and Africa region contributed 5% of worldwide fee revenue.
For 2017, the combined portfolio in the Asia Pacific region should see continued strength in India and Shanghai more than offsetting weakness in Macau and tertiary markets in China, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low to mid-single-digit rate. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Asia Pacific region fee revenue totaled 13% of worldwide fee revenue, with about half of that coming from Greater China.
And finally, for Europe, we expect low single-digit RevPAR growth in 2017, with particular strength in Southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Europe contributed 8% of worldwide fee revenue. On a worldwide basis, we expect 2017 RevPAR will be flat to up 2%.
Turning to development. For 2016, we expect our combined company should grow global rooms distribution by roughly 5%, net of deletions. Project delays at both Marriott and Starwood have pushed a few openings to early 2017, but new deal signings remain very strong. As of quarter-end, our combined pipeline totaled nearly 420,000 rooms. For 2017, rooms growth should accelerate to roughly 6%, net of deletions.
In the U.S., the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolio represent 14% of open rooms, yet we have an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in the U.S. and 23% of rooms under construction worldwide. To be sure, leverage levels on new construction loans have moderated and construction costs are also increasing. While these conditions are not likely to change supply growth in the near-term, we believe they should discourage marginal new projects from moving forward. They should also enhance our share of new construction as lenders continue to favor the strongest brands. Incidentally, our combined portfolio of hotels gained RevPAR index globally in the third quarter and we are optimistic that we will see further gains as we realize revenue synergies.
We continue to be optimistic about the Starwood acquisitions. Six weeks after closing, we have accomplished a great deal. We will continue to do the hard work necessary to be the best hospitality company for our owners, franchisees, associates, guests and for you, our investors.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on fourth quarter and 2017. As I do, let me first offer my thanks to Leeny and the finance teams across Marriott and Legacy-Starwood. Closing our acquisition just 8 days before the end of the quarter was not ideal, but they scrambled and they did it beautifully. Thank you, all. Leeny?"
31148,403607503,1079554,"Marriott International, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2016",2016-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Marriott International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Arne.As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26.

As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26. GAAP results were constrained by $237 million of merger-related costs, including $186 million of severance and retention costs, $24 million of transition costs, $18 million of transaction costs and $9 million of interest expense, partially offset by the 8 days of Starwood's operating results.
To provide visibility into Legacy-Marriott's performance in the quarter, we've adjusted third quarter results by backing out the 8 days of Legacy-Starwood results and merger-related costs as well as conforming the share count. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Legacy-Marriott business totaled $0.91, a 17% increase over the prior year.
Compared to our July 27 guidance, adjusted fee revenue was $6 million below the midpoint of expectations due to more modest RevPAR growth and lower than expected application and relicensing fees. Still, on an adjusted basis, our operating income of $378 million exceeded our guidance of $370 million to $375 million as we saw good performance on our owned, leased and other net line, lower than expected depreciation and amortization expense and better than expected G&A spending due to solid cost controls and some open positions.
Adjusted fee revenue for the Legacy-Marriott business increased 6%, with incentive fees up 13% in the third quarter. While Legacy-Marriott RevPAR and unit growth drove fees higher, fees were constrained by $9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Worldwide, house profit margins for Legacy-Marriott increased 90 basis points for company-operated hotels as many hotels are already focused on cost containment in a slower RevPAR growth environment. Strong results on our owned and leased hotels reflected recently completed renovations in Tokyo and Charlotte, the addition of 2 new hotels in Rio de Janeiro which benefited from the Olympics and stronger branding fees.
Adjusted G&A increased 3% year-over-year. The increase in interest income reflected a larger portfolio of loans.
Marriott's third quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $474 million, a 10% increase over the prior year.
So let's talk some more about the transaction. We presented selected pro forma third quarter information on Page A-16 of the press release, assuming the Starwood acquisition and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business had been completed on January 1, 2015, but using the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. Incidentally, we expect to provide a more detailed pro forma income statement for historic quarters in the next couple of months after we fine-tune purchase accounting estimates.
So combining Marriott's and Starwood's information, pro forma fee revenue totaled $723 million for the third quarter, an increase of 5.5% over the prior year, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct costs, totaled $166 million, an increase of more than 21%. As I mentioned earlier, Marriott owned and leased hotels benefited from recently completed renovations in the Olympics in the third quarter. Results for Legacy-Starwood owned and leased hotels were also strong, particularly in Hawaii, Toronto and Brazil. Starwood RevPAR comparable worldwide owned and leased hotels increased more than 8% in the third quarter, with particularly strong profit flow-through.
For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue should total $695 million to $705 million, an increase of 1% to 2% over prior year pro forma fees. Our fee growth reflects roughly 5% unit growth. Fees are growing slower than unit due to modest RevPAR growth in North America, lower RevPAR in the Middle East and resulting lower profit flow-through and a modest decline in incentive fees. We also expect some negative FX impact of several contract changes and some givebacks of IMF recognized earlier in 2016.
We expect fourth quarter owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, should total roughly $150 million to $155 million. In the year-ago quarter, pro forma owned, leased and other net included $3 million from hotels that have since been sold by Starwood and $11 million in termination fees.
While Arne outlined our RevPAR expectations for the fourth quarter and 2017, in case you have a different view, we estimate that 1 point change in our RevPAR outlook across today's combined Marriott-Starwood system, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million for owned, leased and other net.
We expect depreciation and amortization will total $70 million to $75 million. Excluding merger-related costs, we expect G&A to total $235 million to $240 million in the fourth quarter, 16% to 18% lower than the pro forma prior year. Our anticipated fourth quarter 2016 G&A result should benefit from $8 million from a legal settlement, while the pro forma fourth quarter 2015 G&A included $5 million in Marriott merger-related costs. Fourth quarter operating income should total $530 million to $555 million, a 9% to 14% improvement over 2015 pro forma levels.
As Arne described, we're working hard to integrate the companies as quickly as possible. We expect to finalize the organization's structure for most regions and departments during the fourth quarter, but some may not be complete and in place until mid-2017. During 2017, we will also have wind-down costs included in G&A related to some duplicate systems, facilities and other areas of overlap. As a result, estimating quarter-to-quarter G&A in 2017 is challenging, but we expect to see significant progress toward our expected $250 million in G&A savings during the year. We expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by 2018.
For depreciation and amortization, you may recall that we estimated Marriott's stand-alone depreciation and amortization at roughly $130 million for 2016 during our last earnings call. In the 8-K filed on March 25, 2016, we estimated a run rate for incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction would total $209 million annually. Combined with Marriott's stand-alone D&A would imply a $339 million annual D&A run rate for the combined company.
Now that the transaction is closed, we've completed the preliminary allocation of our purchase price to the fair value of Starwood's assets and liabilities, which will be included in our upcoming 10-Q, likely to be filed tomorrow. This current view puts incremental D&A at closer to $140 million to $150 million annually and puts total D&A for the combined company at a roughly $270 million to $280 million run rate.
Compared to our prior depreciation and amortization estimate, our current view reflects updated information, a refined analysis of the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the impact of Starwood's successful asset sales year-to-date and the classification of several owned assets today as assets held for sale.
Purchase accounting rules provide a time frame of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition. Therefore, in the coming year, there could be changes to these allocations and resulting catch-ups could impact our P&L on the D&A line.
We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. For the full year of 2016, we estimate actual investment spending will total $425 million to $475 million. Included in this amount is roughly $75 million for investment spending for Legacy-Starwood brands in the fourth quarter. The Legacy-Marriott amount is about $125 million lower than last quarter's estimate, largely due to fewer development-related investments than previously expected.
When we announced the proposed acquisition of Starwood, we outlined the opportunity to sell owned hotels for $1.5 billion to $2 billion over 2 years. Of this amount, Starwood has already completed the sale of 5 hotels for $325 million. Today, we own 15 hotels operating under the Starwood brand. In 2016, we believe these owned hotels could generate EBITDA of approximately $180 million to $190 million. Eight of the hotels are in North America, with the remainder largely located in Latin America. We believe we can monetize these hotels for north of $1.5 billion, with the North American assets likely to be sold relatively faster.
We also believe there may be an opportunity to monetize some of Starwood's joint venture interests, which could recycle additional capital. At this time, we aren't prepared to offer an estimate of proceeds.
Our balance sheet is in a better position than we anticipated. As you know, the transaction took over 10 months from announcement to closing. During this time, both companies accumulated cash from operations as well as proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction, Starwood used excess cash to reduce debt balances by nearly $800 million. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, Marriott had $8.8 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash.
As part of the acquisition, we reorganized the company's entity structure to facilitate the combined companies' global operation. Given the new entity structure put in place as part of this reorganization, we expect global cash balances will continue to decline in the near-term.
Our debt ratio at September 30 is better than our earlier forecast by roughly 40 basis points, driven fairly equally by improved EBITDAR, higher overall cash balances from the delay in the transaction, higher confidence in our ability to use all of Starwood's cash and then, to a lesser extent, better estimates of our increased lease commitments as a result of the transaction.
We believe today that we are within the range of our targeted 3 to 3.25 adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR credit standards, excluding the impact of merger-related costs and charges. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.
We know that you're eager for more information about the combined company. We will have much more to say about 2017 in February and when we hold our Analyst Day in March. But as you can tell, for now, we feel very good about our brands, our business and our progress in integrating Starwood.

I think it's still relatively early in assessing the impact of this. What we've seen so far is encouraging to us, but I think, fairly, we don't have statistics that we can use that would prove to you that we have delivered true success from this yet. But the early statistics, we see a high level of sign-ups, I think something like 800,000 or 900,000 incremental Marriott Rewards sign-ups since member-only rates were launched.
I think we are getting through the din of the marketing battles. As we've talked about in the past, there was a perception that rates at our hotels were cheaper on channels other than our own, which has not been true for well over a decade, and we wanted to really find a way to break through that noise and make sure folks knew that they could get competitive rates by booking directly with us. And going so far as to say there's a bit of a discount actually if you book directly with us we thought was a powerful way to get there.
And so we're seeing good pickup of that marketing message, good stickiness with the loyalty program. Obviously, though, the discounts are available to folks who would have booked directly previously as well as folks who might be booking directly now for the first time, and that has -- continues to have a very modest impact on RevPAR. We think, in Q3, probably about 30 basis points. And we'll watch this as we go forward. Obviously, this is something we talk with our owners about with some regularity. And I think, generally, the community to include us and our owner partners is supportive of continuing to pursue this. So it's all systems go."

Having said that, listening to the words that they used and going through our own press, I think there's a couple of things that we would say.

So the first thing to point out is this is not a range which is driven by the recently completed merger with Starwood. I think the second thing, and my guess is this is more or less the full explanation you'll get, is that we expect GDP to continue with the sort of anemic numbers that have been posted in 2016 as we go into 2017 and beyond. And it sounded as if one of our largest competitors was expecting a rebound of some sort in GDP. We are -- we hope they're right. Obviously, if GDP performs stronger, that will increase demand strength in our business. But we're building a model that essentially assumes we'll continue to bump along at the levels we've been at."

And I think we cautioned folks that, that was not likely to hold because as we got farther into the year, we would see that we could book less because we had less capacity. And so we expected that we would tail down towards the maybe mid to high single digits. But I think the experience in the last quarter or so going from roughly 7% to roughly 2% is worse than we anticipated. I think if there are a couple of -- one positive thing that can be said next to that, when you look at bookings done in Q3 for all future periods, we were up about 8%, if memory serves. So people are still making commitments on group business and there's good growth.

But as you look at kind of tough comps across the board, again, we're continuing to look for our owned, leased portfolios to do well. And for the branding fees to continue, we've got a great pipeline of projects to continue to do well. I think the part I would point out is the owned, leased portfolio on the Starwood side, we clearly are seeing the impact of their sold hotels. So as you look at that going forward, you would see the owned, leased profit related to that, that would kind of, on a year-over-year basis from '17 to '16, decline. And then you probably got a couple of one-off like the Olympics in 2016. But again, the biggest impact, I think, will be the change in owned hotels on Starwood's side."

It is not a conservative external target, which looks different from the target that we've got internally. And so I would continue to look at that. To state the obvious, with 8 days only of Starwood in Q3, I think it's difficult for you -- for us, let alone you, to conclude how much of that $250 million we've achieved so far. But we're getting underway, we're getting underway very quickly. And as you could tell from our preliminary comments, we're really trying to set up the organization as quickly as we possibly can so that the change to people is behind us, and so that people can be looking forward. So we'll move it, move it. I think just to state the obvious, 2017 will be a bit messy because we'll have transaction and transition costs that will help you understand as each quarter is reported. They're a bit difficult really honestly for us to predict by quarter at this point in time. But we remain optimistic by the time that we get towards sort of 12 months from closing, the lion's share of that $250 million, at least from a run rate basis, should have been achieved. We can't tell you [indiscernible] that we know for certain that every final dollar of that will be achieved by 12/31/'17. I suspect there could be some areas where we're running duplicate systems or something else that creates some [indiscernible] slop in '18 but will be very close. And to the extent we don't achieve the year-end, we'll, I think, get it fairly quickly in 2018. I think in terms of synergies for the hotels, both top line and bottom line, we talked obviously about the loyalty program. I think the early response from our customers about linking those programs and matching status is very comforting. And that is exactly the kind of response we want and expect will hopefully drive larger share of wallet for us with an even larger loyalty community. And obviously, that's what we're focused on. And then on the cost side, we obviously talked about procurement, we talked about OTA commissions, but we're looking at essentially every relationship that the 2 companies have, whether they be about cost systems that are proprietary to us or third-party contracts we're trying to make sure we deliver using the economies of scale that we've got and think that we can deliver top and bottom line improvements for our hotel owners in both portfolios."

In terms of what kind of you're looking at across the board from the 2 companies having to suffer from everything from the Middle East to what we've changed in FX and the impact of RevPAR going forward. So I think it's overwhelmingly incentive fees. And base and franchise they're going to look a lot more normal relative to the growth in unit and the growth in RevPAR. There are a few contract changes here and there that could impact the difference between franchise and managed per se, but overall when you look at base and franchise, they're going to look very much in line with what goes on with RevPAR and unit growth. It's really incentive fees where you're going to see this combination of effects. And the other thing again, year-over-year, when you kind of adjust and look for full year, I think that is important to look at because you've got some quarter-to-quarter variations that affect these.

First of all, clearly next year, with the kind of RevPAR that we've outlined, we would be thrilled to end up with flat margins. We have done an incredible job with margins in the RevPAR environment that we've had this year. And perhaps in some respects, you could argue that we've gotten margin that now we will be happy to keep in terms of the margin improvement. So I think on that standpoint, I wouldn't look to see higher IMFs as a result of any margin improvement with essentially what is a pretty low RevPAR environment. Now we would expect to have unit growth and we expect to have unit growth internationally, which is going to obviously help our IMFs, given the construct of our contracts there. Where it is tough to predict is this issue of where. For example, when you look at the Middle East this particular quarter that we're looking at in Q4, you clearly see the dramatic effect of lower RevPAR on our IMFs as we go into Q4. So I think that's where we need to get into the details on our budgeting process to look at the trade-off between unit growth internationally as well as RevPAR as well as then the performance of specific markets and what happens to their IMFs.

We are heavily involved in every single one of the systems that you described. I think kind of you can start at the easy place, which is thinking about the hotels and actually the way that they operate, and we are looking at putting them all onto the same back-office system that we have at the Marriott Hotels. And that's a process that we'll be getting into absolutely as soon as we can. As we look at the reservations and the loyalty platforms, clearly, there is a massive amount of work to be done, and it also -- we need to take into consideration our relationships with our credit card and timeshare partners and a lot of technology work in looking at what exactly it will take. So we can't give you a specific time frame yet on the exact timing but certainly moving in that direction. And as far as the -- kind of the fundamental systems of everything from company payroll and the way the hotels work, we are moving so that well into 2017, we will have everybody on the same system."

I mean, if we have not merged with Starwood, would we be trying to build 30 brands from scratch? I think the answer is probably not. At the same time, having done this deal, the 30 brands all exist, they all have substantial capital that has been invested in them particularly by the hotel owners who have made deliberate bets about which they put on their hotels. And we don't have the power to nor the desire to try and convince them that those bets have not been good bets. I think the other thing that's really important to recognize here if we -- the biggest expense from a brand perspective in theory is about marketing brands. And obviously, that's the most expensive when each brand has to be marketed on its own. And in that context, you would want as much definition you could have between breads, and it would still be expensive to go out and market each one alone. I think in many respects, that's no longer our model if it ever was. I think the principal model today is we go to market through our loyalty platform through our dotcom site, through our app. And those things allow us to essentially market a portfolio and offer, through that portfolio, an incredible range of choice to our customers, which drives actually conversion from looking to booking that much higher and makes the economics of each brand better, not weaker. And so you put all that together and I think that's why we conclude that we're going to keep these brands and we're going to continue to grow them. I don't really think that there are material incremental costs to having a brand, given that, that's the business model that we have."

I think the other thing I would point out is that earlier when we were looking, we had less comfort about knowing the details around their cash globally. And as a result of during the entity restructuring that I described earlier, we are comfortable that we are going to be able to use all of the -- all the cash balances that we don't need to run our business to repay debt and use for general corporate purposes over the near term.

I think the 3 biggest ones, as we described before, the 3 biggest changes to the 40 basis point improvement was, as we described, just more cash overall being able to feel comfortable about our access to that cash; the level of the EBITDAR, which is refined for both their higher owned lease performance; and frankly, the combination of the 2 companies' combined performance on the latest trailing 12-month; and then the third [ph] that you were able to look at the actual amounts of cash that you have on hand."

And those loyalty programs, managed well, should allow us to drive that much more of our business directly from our most loyal members, which is the cheapest business for us to book because it comes and books to us directly. And to -- you don't do that just by being nice and good-looking. You've got to do that by delivering real value to those customers because they're not going to be loyal to us unless it's in their interest to be loyal. And so we're working through those things. They include significant workaround systems and the like that we use to have our relationship with them but also how do we continue to make sure we're delivering value to them. And so free WiFi and member rates and mobile check-in and keyless entry and points, these are already things which are really available to our loyalty members but not to other customers.

Think about particularly markets in which select-serve tells are much more prominent than full-service hotels. Starwood had obviously some Four Points, a few Alofts and precious few Elements but you compare the number of those 3 brands that Starwood had across the United States with what Marriott had in Courtyard and Streethill Suites and Residence Inn and Fairfield and the like, and there are thousands more places for those customers to stay with us now broadly defined as the new Marriott. And as a consequence, we should drive more share. And with that greater distribution, the loyalty program itself becomes more powerful. Obviously, one of the things that customers look for is what are the benefits I get in terms of suite upgrades or bonus points or access to lounges or other things? But also can I stay within that network regularly when I travel so that I can earn the kind of status and earn the number of points that I need in order to really get the free vacations or to get the other things that I want to get with those points?

But if you look at the portfolio as a whole, the full-service hotels get disproportionate benefit from group business, and group business is stronger than corporate transient particularly today. The managed select-service portfolio also skews not as much as the full-service hotels but skews a little bit more towards group than the franchise select-service portfolio does. And so that's helpful too. And I think the third thing is around geographic distribution. So when you look at select-service, when you look at the franchise portfolio, when you look at a lot of industry data, select-service hotels can skew more towards oil and gas markets. Think about markets that we never heard of before and a couple of years ago like Williston, North Dakota and environs where you got all this oil work that's happening out there, select-service hotels exploded [indiscernible] there's not a single full-service hotel in the whole area basically and maybe a little less dramatic in markets like Houston. But you look across Texas, you look across many of these markets and you'll see that those hotels are competing, on average, tougher markets again without the benefit of group and that would be the bulk of the explanation."

At this point, we're really not in a position to kind of get super detailed. I think the easiest way to describe it is what we talked about from an EBITDA perspective, which is the $180 million to $190 million of EBITDA associated with Starwood's owned hotels. We also did talk about the fact that our depreciation and amortization estimates associated with the purchase of Starwood have declined relative to the earlier description. And part of that, I'd say roughly half of that, was associated with moving several of those hotels into the assets held for sale category, which is again going to impact D&A but is not going to impact the owned hotels net. So specific numbers, we'll be able to talk more about in February. I think for now, the EBITDA is probably the easier way to think about it. Obviously, when we sell these hotels, we'll end up with a great stream of management fees in managing the hotels. So it's one thing to keep in mind is that although there is EBITDA that goes to the buyer of these assets, we're going to continue to have a great stream of earnings from them."

On average though, you would expect that the sales prices we received should be at least at the EBITDA level, if not higher, that the company is trading at. And so the transaction should be accretive from an EBITDA perspective. And when you look at it from an earnings perspective after depreciation associated with owned hotels, they should be significantly accretive from an earnings perspective. Now again, that's on average. We're not saying necessarily that in a higher cap rate market where the risk profile is actually quite different that we will necessarily always get proceeds which are higher than our EBITDA multiple. But I think generally across the average, we should see that this is accretive to the P&L and the balance sheet of the company."

So we do have in this headquarters building someplace, I'm sure, a detailed schedule of when we think hotels are going to open. But we're not rolling that out necessarily in a way that's very digestible by quarter. Having said that, I would think to the earlier question about when supply growth will peak. I suspect we are continuing to see, on average, that we're opening more next year than this year, and we're probably opening more in '18 than in '17, which would suggest that there will be some back-end skewering to next year. I don't think it will be profound though. Obviously, we've opened a lot of hotels this year. We've missed a little bit this year and those are slipping into '17 but there'll be in early '17. And so I think the year as a whole should be fairly robust in terms of its openings. But again, I'd suspect fourth quarter will have more than the first quarter did simply because we continue to ramp. On fee growth, obviously, the 2 biggest inputs to the year-over-year fee growth is unit growth and RevPAR. And with 6% unit growth and 0% to 2% RevPAR growth, both can drive an increase in the top line. Although it's obvious that the rooms growth will drive more top line growth than the RevPAR growth unless we're widely conservative in that 0% to 2% number. The next piece of that is what happens with incentive fees. And I think there, you end up in a 0% to 2% market with the real need to say, ""Okay, what's happening in the high incentive fee markets for the company like New York, like Washington, like London."" And other markets around the world. And until we do the budget, that's going to be hard to give you much guidance.

Welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. For those in the U.S., happy Election Day. We're pleased you're taking the time to listen to our earnings call, but we hope you also get to the polls today.
Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, November 8, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
There are several topics we want to cover today, including our third quarter financial results, third quarter business trends, fourth quarter guidance and our early look into 2017. But first, we want to talk about the Starwood acquisition and the integration.
This is the first earnings call for the new Marriott International. On September 23, we completed the most transformational transaction in the company's history. Including the pipeline, our global system encompasses nearly 1.6 million guestrooms today.
Our near-term priorities are straight forward. We talked to associates to net the company together culturally, seize as soon as possible top line synergies, property cost efficiencies and $250 million in G&A savings, and do all this while remaining focused on our ongoing business, providing great experiences for our guests and driving returns for our owners and franchisees.
Off to a fast start, our team did what no other large consumer company has accomplished. Within minutes after the merger closed, we linked 3 enormous loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest, further announcing that we would match member status between the programs. We immediately enabled our loyal travelers to earn points in one program and redeem in the other. In fact, over 3.3 billion points were transferred between the programs in the first month alone, while the first transfer and redemption reservation occurred just 15 minutes after we closed the transaction.
That effort did not go unnoticed by customers and commentators. Blogger Gary Leff, who writes View from the Wing, noted to his readers that, ""No program has ever set up a mechanism to link accounts this quickly."" And my favorite quote came from a loyalty member who tweeted, ""Don't know if I'm more excited about linking Marriott Rewards or the fact that pumpkin spiced lattes are back.""
Doing the loyalty programs right has been a big priority for us since the deal was announced. Today, we are pleased to confirm that only 16% of our combined 85 million members were members of both programs prior to the merger. This puts us in a tremendous position to capture incremental business.
Immediately after closing, we also reached out to our largest B2B customers to tell them the great news and to begin cross-selling across our 30 brands. For our group business, we have seen over 1,000 lead referrals through the end of October between the Starwood and Marriott portfolios.
We are moving quickly to reduce costs, both in G&A as well as costs for our hotels. Procurement is a near-term opportunity. Starwood-managed hotels will begin transitioning to Avendra, the purchasing platform used by Legacy-Marriott Hotels and many other companies, in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Next year, we should see savings on OTA contracts. With its greater scale, Marriott has historically been able to obtain more attractive OTA contract terms. While savings to Starwood Hotels will vary by region, applying Marriott's contract terms should save Starwood owners OTA commissions, even assuming no change in OTA usage, with more savings expected in 2018.
We know that you are anxious to hear much more about our integration strategy and synergy opportunities, but let us ask you for your patience. The hotel business is about the details. Every market is different and every property is different. We can tell you we've reviewed and assimilated a tremendous amount of information from Starwood over the last 6 weeks and that we remain as enthusiastic about the transaction as ever.
While the deal is very exciting, we are also focused on business fundamentals. While reported third quarter financial results included only 8 days of Starwood results, today's outlook is drawn from an analysis of operating trends at both companies for all 3 months of the quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2017 reflects the combined company.
Clearly, North American demand continues -- demand growth continues to moderate. In the third quarter, hotels with the weakest RevPAR were generally in oil and gas markets or in gateway cities affected by continued weak international visitation or impacted by new supply. In the quarter, both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood portfolios did well in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Toronto and Washington, D.C., while both portfolios saw RevPAR declines in Houston, New York and San Francisco. On a combined basis, North America company-operated group RevPAR increased nearly 7%, benefiting from strong demand and a favorable holiday comparison.
Catering revenue continues to be strong. New group business is encouraging too. In the third quarter alone, Marriott and Starwood's sales organizations booked a combined 3.6 million room nights for future periods. Measured by booked group revenue, the 2 companies booked 6% more business than in the prior year, with particular strength for stays in 2018 and beyond.
In contrast, corporate customers are clearly cautious. In our last earnings call, we mentioned a trend in room sales among Legacy-Marriott's largest 300 corporate customers in North America, from 4% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2% in the first quarter to less than 1% growth in the second quarter. For this quarter, room revenue from Legacy-Marriott's top 300 customers was flat year-over-year as higher demand from professional services, retail and health care firms was offset by lower demand from technology, financial, energy and manufacturing companies.
Looking ahead in North America, fourth quarter group RevPAR pace for our company-operated Marriott and Starwood full-service hotels is down about 5%, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons combined with weak near-term corporate bookings. With greater availability, transient business should improve year-over-year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR for the combined system-wide Marriott and Starwood portfolios in North America will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Outside the U.S., third quarter performance of the Marriott and Starwood brands was very similar when adjusting for differences in geographic distribution. Across both portfolios in the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR growth was very strong in Brazil and Mexico, but was constrained by Zika in the Caribbean, weak economic growth in South America and new supply in Central America. For the fourth quarter, we expect Zika will continue to be a problem for the combined portfolio. And without the Olympics, we expect Brazil hotels will more acutely feel the effect of their weak economy. As a result, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our hotels in the region will be flattish with the prior year.
In the Middle East and Africa, easy Ramadan comparisons took Marriott and Starwood RevPAR higher in the third quarter, along with greater leisure business in South Africa and strong regional demand in Cairo. At the same time, many oil markets remained weak. Without the benefit of a holiday shift, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our combined portfolio in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate.
In the Asia Pacific region, Marriott and Starwood saw third quarter RevPAR improvement in India, South Korea and Shanghai, with declines in the Maldives, Macau and tertiary markets in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio should be flattish year-over-year, constrained by the cancellations that followed the death of the king in Thailand. 
In Europe, Marriott and Starwood occupancy in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul was weak in the third quarter, while our U.K. properties welcomed a greater number of Middle East travelers in the quarter. Hotels in Poland, Russia and Spain reported strong RevPAR growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio to be flattish year-over-year due to lingering terrorism concerns, weak group pace in London, Paris and Amsterdam and tougher comparisons in Poland and Russia.
Bottom line, we expect worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead to 2017, our North America outlook assumes a steady-as-she-goes economy and modestly higher supply growth. For the 2017 full year, North America revenue group pace for company-operated full-service hotels across the Marriott and Starwood portfolios is currently up about 2%.
For transient business, we expect current weak corporate demand to persist, although comparisons should get easier. We are targeting a higher volume of special corporate rate business for the coming year and expect special corporate room rates for comparable customers to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in most markets.
We are aggressively marketing to leisure guests and adding contract business at attractive rates. As a result, for 2017, we expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, North American fee revenue from the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 70% of worldwide fee revenue.
Outside North America in 2017, we expect incremental constant dollar system-wide RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America regions should also be flat to up 2%, reflecting good performance in Mexico and Central America. In 2015, Caribbean and Latin America pro forma fee revenue from the Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 4% of worldwide total fee revenue.
For the Middle East and Africa region, South Africa and Cairo should be strong, but we also see continued weak oil markets and risk of political disruption. As a result, we believe RevPAR will be flattish in the region in 2017. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Marriott's and Starwood's Middle East and Africa region contributed 5% of worldwide fee revenue.
For 2017, the combined portfolio in the Asia Pacific region should see continued strength in India and Shanghai more than offsetting weakness in Macau and tertiary markets in China, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low to mid-single-digit rate. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Asia Pacific region fee revenue totaled 13% of worldwide fee revenue, with about half of that coming from Greater China.
And finally, for Europe, we expect low single-digit RevPAR growth in 2017, with particular strength in Southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Europe contributed 8% of worldwide fee revenue. On a worldwide basis, we expect 2017 RevPAR will be flat to up 2%.
Turning to development. For 2016, we expect our combined company should grow global rooms distribution by roughly 5%, net of deletions. Project delays at both Marriott and Starwood have pushed a few openings to early 2017, but new deal signings remain very strong. As of quarter-end, our combined pipeline totaled nearly 420,000 rooms. For 2017, rooms growth should accelerate to roughly 6%, net of deletions.
In the U.S., the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolio represent 14% of open rooms, yet we have an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in the U.S. and 23% of rooms under construction worldwide. To be sure, leverage levels on new construction loans have moderated and construction costs are also increasing. While these conditions are not likely to change supply growth in the near-term, we believe they should discourage marginal new projects from moving forward. They should also enhance our share of new construction as lenders continue to favor the strongest brands. Incidentally, our combined portfolio of hotels gained RevPAR index globally in the third quarter and we are optimistic that we will see further gains as we realize revenue synergies.
We continue to be optimistic about the Starwood acquisitions. Six weeks after closing, we have accomplished a great deal. We will continue to do the hard work necessary to be the best hospitality company for our owners, franchisees, associates, guests and for you, our investors.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on fourth quarter and 2017. As I do, let me first offer my thanks to Leeny and the finance teams across Marriott and Legacy-Starwood. Closing our acquisition just 8 days before the end of the quarter was not ideal, but they scrambled and they did it beautifully. Thank you, all. Leeny?"

GAAP results were constrained by $237 million of merger-related costs, including $186 million of severance and retention costs, $24 million of tran",1661,"Thank you, Arne.
As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26. GAAP results were constrained by $237 million of merger-related costs, including $186 million of severance and retention costs, $24 million of transition costs, $18 million of transaction costs and $9 million of interest expense, partially offset by the 8 days of Starwood's operating results.
To provide visibility into Legacy-Marriott's performance in the quarter, we've adjusted third quarter results by backing out the 8 days of Legacy-Starwood results and merger-related costs as well as conforming the share count. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Legacy-Marriott business totaled $0.91, a 17% increase over the prior year.
Compared to our July 27 guidance, adjusted fee revenue was $6 million below the midpoint of expectations due to more modest RevPAR growth and lower than expected application and relicensing fees. Still, on an adjusted basis, our operating income of $378 million exceeded our guidance of $370 million to $375 million as we saw good performance on our owned, leased and other net line, lower than expected depreciation and amortization expense and better than expected G&A spending due to solid cost controls and some open positions.
Adjusted fee revenue for the Legacy-Marriott business increased 6%, with incentive fees up 13% in the third quarter. While Legacy-Marriott RevPAR and unit growth drove fees higher, fees were constrained by $9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Worldwide, house profit margins for Legacy-Marriott increased 90 basis points for company-operated hotels as many hotels are already focused on cost containment in a slower RevPAR growth environment. Strong results on our owned and leased hotels reflected recently completed renovations in Tokyo and Charlotte, the addition of 2 new hotels in Rio de Janeiro which benefited from the Olympics and stronger branding fees.
Adjusted G&A increased 3% year-over-year. The increase in interest income reflected a larger portfolio of loans.
Marriott's third quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $474 million, a 10% increase over the prior year.
So let's talk some more about the transaction. We presented selected pro forma third quarter information on Page A-16 of the press release, assuming the Starwood acquisition and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business had been completed on January 1, 2015, but using the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. Incidentally, we expect to provide a more detailed pro forma income statement for historic quarters in the next couple of months after we fine-tune purchase accounting estimates.
So combining Marriott's and Starwood's information, pro forma fee revenue totaled $723 million for the third quarter, an increase of 5.5% over the prior year, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct costs, totaled $166 million, an increase of more than 21%. As I mentioned earlier, Marriott owned and leased hotels benefited from recently completed renovations in the Olympics in the third quarter. Results for Legacy-Starwood owned and leased hotels were also strong, particularly in Hawaii, Toronto and Brazil. Starwood RevPAR comparable worldwide owned and leased hotels increased more than 8% in the third quarter, with particularly strong profit flow-through.
For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue should total $695 million to $705 million, an increase of 1% to 2% over prior year pro forma fees. Our fee growth reflects roughly 5% unit growth. Fees are growing slower than unit due to modest RevPAR growth in North America, lower RevPAR in the Middle East and resulting lower profit flow-through and a modest decline in incentive fees. We also expect some negative FX impact of several contract changes and some givebacks of IMF recognized earlier in 2016.
We expect fourth quarter owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, should total roughly $150 million to $155 million. In the year-ago quarter, pro forma owned, leased and other net included $3 million from hotels that have since been sold by Starwood and $11 million in termination fees.
While Arne outlined our RevPAR expectations for the fourth quarter and 2017, in case you have a different view, we estimate that 1 point change in our RevPAR outlook across today's combined Marriott-Starwood system, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million for owned, leased and other net.
We expect depreciation and amortization will total $70 million to $75 million. Excluding merger-related costs, we expect G&A to total $235 million to $240 million in the fourth quarter, 16% to 18% lower than the pro forma prior year. Our anticipated fourth quarter 2016 G&A result should benefit from $8 million from a legal settlement, while the pro forma fourth quarter 2015 G&A included $5 million in Marriott merger-related costs. Fourth quarter operating income should total $530 million to $555 million, a 9% to 14% improvement over 2015 pro forma levels.
As Arne described, we're working hard to integrate the companies as quickly as possible. We expect to finalize the organization's structure for most regions and departments during the fourth quarter, but some may not be complete and in place until mid-2017. During 2017, we will also have wind-down costs included in G&A related to some duplicate systems, facilities and other areas of overlap. As a result, estimating quarter-to-quarter G&A in 2017 is challenging, but we expect to see significant progress toward our expected $250 million in G&A savings during the year. We expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by 2018.
For depreciation and amortization, you may recall that we estimated Marriott's stand-alone depreciation and amortization at roughly $130 million for 2016 during our last earnings call. In the 8-K filed on March 25, 2016, we estimated a run rate for incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction would total $209 million annually. Combined with Marriott's stand-alone D&A would imply a $339 million annual D&A run rate for the combined company.
Now that the transaction is closed, we've completed the preliminary allocation of our purchase price to the fair value of Starwood's assets and liabilities, which will be included in our upcoming 10-Q, likely to be filed tomorrow. This current view puts incremental D&A at closer to $140 million to $150 million annually and puts total D&A for the combined company at a roughly $270 million to $280 million run rate.
Compared to our prior depreciation and amortization estimate, our current view reflects updated information, a refined analysis of the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the impact of Starwood's successful asset sales year-to-date and the classification of several owned assets today as assets held for sale.
Purchase accounting rules provide a time frame of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition. Therefore, in the coming year, there could be changes to these allocations and resulting catch-ups could impact our P&L on the D&A line.
We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. For the full year of 2016, we estimate actual investment spending will total $425 million to $475 million. Included in this amount is roughly $75 million for investment spending for Legacy-Starwood brands in the fourth quarter. The Legacy-Marriott amount is about $125 million lower than last quarter's estimate, largely due to fewer development-related investments than previously expected.
When we announced the proposed acquisition of Starwood, we outlined the opportunity to sell owned hotels for $1.5 billion to $2 billion over 2 years. Of this amount, Starwood has already completed the sale of 5 hotels for $325 million. Today, we own 15 hotels operating under the Starwood brand. In 2016, we believe these owned hotels could generate EBITDA of approximately $180 million to $190 million. Eight of the hotels are in North America, with the remainder largely located in Latin America. We believe we can monetize these hotels for north of $1.5 billion, with the North American assets likely to be sold relatively faster.
We also believe there may be an opportunity to monetize some of Starwood's joint venture interests, which could recycle additional capital. At this time, we aren't prepared to offer an estimate of proceeds.
Our balance sheet is in a better position than we anticipated. As you know, the transaction took over 10 months from announcement to closing. During this time, both companies accumulated cash from operations as well as proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction, Starwood used excess cash to reduce debt balances by nearly $800 million. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, Marriott had $8.8 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash.
As part of the acquisition, we reorganized the company's entity structure to facilitate the combined companies' global operation. Given the new entity structure put in place as part of this reorganization, we expect global cash balances will continue to decline in the near-term.
Our debt ratio at September 30 is better than our earlier forecast by roughly 40 basis points, driven fairly equally by improved EBITDAR, higher overall cash balances from the delay in the transaction, higher confidence in our ability to use all of Starwood's cash and then, to a lesser extent, better estimates of our increased lease commitments as a result of the transaction.
We believe today that we are within the range of our targeted 3 to 3.25 adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR credit standards, excluding the impact of merger-related costs and charges. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.
We know that you're eager for more information about the combined company. We will have much more to say about 2017 in February and when we hold our Analyst Day in March. But as you can tell, for now, we feel very good about our brands, our business and our progress in integrating Starwood.

I think it's still relatively early in assessing the impact of this. What we've seen so far is encouraging to us, but I think, fairly, we don't have statistics that we can use that would prove to you that we have delivered true success from this yet. But the early statistics, we see a high level of sign-ups, I think something like 800,000 or 900,000 incremental Marriott Rewards sign-ups since member-only rates were launched.
I think we are getting through the din of the marketing battles. As we've talked about in the past, there was a perception that rates at our hotels were cheaper on channels other than our own, which has not been true for well over a decade, and we wanted to really find a way to break through that noise and make sure folks knew that they could get competitive rates by booking directly with us. And going so far as to say there's a bit of a discount actually if you book directly with us we thought was a powerful way to get there.
And so we're seeing good pickup of that marketing message, good stickiness with the loyalty program. Obviously, though, the discounts are available to folks who would have booked directly previously as well as folks who might be booking directly now for the first time, and that has -- continues to have a very modest impact on RevPAR. We think, in Q3, probably about 30 basis points. And we'll watch this as we go forward. Obviously, this is something we talk with our owners about with some regularity. And I think, generally, the community to include us and our owner partners is supportive of continuing to pursue this. So it's all systems go."

Having said that, listening to the words that they used and going through our own press, I think there's a couple of things that we would say. One is I think we would be providing exactly the same guidance if we were simply Legacy-Marriott. So the first thing to point out is this is not a range which is driven by the recently completed merger with Starwood.
I think the second thing, and my guess is this is more or less the full explanation you'll get, is that we expect GDP to continue with the sort of anemic numbers that have been posted in 2016 as we go into 2017 and beyond. And it sounded as if one of our largest competitors was expecting a rebound of some sort in GDP. We're hope -- we hope they're right. Obviously, if GDP performs stronger, that will increase demand strength in our business, but we're building a model that essentially assumes we'll continue to bump along at the levels we're -- we've been at."

And I think we cautioned folks that, that was not likely to hold because as we got farther into the year, we would see that we could book less because we had less capacity. And so we expected that we would tail down towards the maybe mid to high single digits. But I think the experience in the last quarter or so, going from roughly 7% to roughly 2%, is worse than we anticipated.
I think there are a couple of -- one positive thing that can be said next to that, when you look at bookings done in Q3 for all future periods, we were up about 8%, if memory serves. So people are still making commitments on group business and there is good growth. But when you look at the near-term, when you look at group bookings in the year -- for the year or you look at group bookings for the next 12 months, we see less robustness there. And, to us, that's a sign of some caution by corporate customers probably particularly who -- in a sense, that's where group business gets most like corporate transient business, too. And there, I think we're seeing companies be just a bit cautious and probably reflect the sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we've been all operating in."

But as you look at kind of tough comps across the board, again, we're continuing to look for our owned, leased portfolios to do well. And for the branding fees to continue, we've got a great pipeline of projects to continue to do well.
I think that the part I would point out is the owned, leased portfolio on the Starwood side, we clearly are seeing the impact of their sold hotels. So as you look at that going forward, you would see the owned, leased profits related to that, that would kind of, on a year-over-year basis, from '17 to '16, decline, and then you probably got a couple of one-off like the Olympics in 2016.

That is not a conservative external target which looks different from the target that we've got internally. And so I would continue to look at that.
To state the obvious, with 8 days only of Starwood in Q3, I think it's difficult for you -- for us, let alone you, to conclude how much of that $250 million we've achieved so far. But we're getting underway, we're getting underway very quickly. And as you could tell from our preliminary comments, we're really trying to set up the organization as quickly as we possibly can so that the change to people is behind us and so that people can be looking forward. And so we'll move it.
I think, just to state the obvious, 2017 will be a bit messy because we'll have transaction and transition costs that will help you understand as each quarter is reported. They're a bit difficult, really, obviously for us to predict by quarter at this point in time. But we remain optimistic by the time that we get towards sort of 12 months from closing, the lion's share of that $250 million, at least from a run rate basis, should have been achieved. We can't tell you sitting here today that we know for certain that every final dollar of that will be achieved by 12/31/17. I suspect there could be some areas where we're running duplicate systems or something else that creates some cross and slop in '18, but we'll be very close. And to the extent we don't achieve the year-end, we'll, I think, get it fairly quickly in 2018.
I think in terms of synergies for the hotels, both top line and bottom line, we talked obviously about the loyalty program. I think the early response from our customers about linking those programs and matching status is very comforting, and that is exactly the kind of response we want and expect will hopefully drive larger share of wallet for us with an even larger loyalty community. And obviously, that's what we're focused on.
And then, on the cost side, we obviously talked about procurement. We talked about OTA commissions. But we're looking at essentially every relationship that the 2 companies have, whether they be about cost of systems that are proprietary to us or third party contracts that we're trying to make sure we deliver using the economies of scale that we've got and think that we can deliver top and bottom line improvements for our hotel owners in both portfolios."

In terms of what kind of you're looking at across the board from the 2 companies having to suffer from everything from the Middle East to what would change in FX and the impact of RevPAR going forward. So I think it's overwhelmingly incentive fees. And base and franchise are going to look a lot more normal relative to the growth in unit and the growth in RevPAR. There are a few contract changes here and there that could impact the difference between franchise and managed per se, but overall when you look at base and franchise, they're going to look very much in line with what goes on with RevPAR and unit growth. It's really incentive fees where you're going to see this combination of effects. And the other thing again, year-over-year, when you kind of adjust and look for full year, I think that is important to look at because you've got some quarter-to-quarter variations that affect these.

First of all, clearly next year, with the kind of RevPAR that we've outlined, we would be thrilled to end up with flat margins. We have done an incredible job with margins in the RevPAR environment that we've had this year. And perhaps in some respects, you could argue that we've gotten margin that now we will be happy to keep in terms of the margin improvement. So I think on that standpoint, I wouldn't look to see higher IMFs as a result of any margin improvement with essentially what is a pretty low RevPAR environment. Now we would expect to have unit growth and we expect to have unit growth internationally, which is going to obviously help our IMF, given the construct of our contracts there. Where it is tough to predict is this issue of where. For example, when you look at the Middle East this particular quarter that we're looking at, in Q4 you clearly see the dramatic effect [ph] of lower RevPAR on our IMFs as we go into Q4. So I think that's where we need to get into the details on our budgeting process to look at the trade-off between unit growth internationally as well as RevPAR as well as then the performance of specific markets and what happens to their IMFs. So it's possible but certainly too soon to tell at this point."

And we don't have the power to nor the desire to try and convince them that those bets have not been good bets. I think the other thing that's really important to recognize here if we -- the biggest expense from a brand perspective in theory is about marketing brands. And obviously, that's the most expensive when each brand has to be marketed on its own. And in that context, you would want as much definition you could have between breads, and it would still be expensive to go out and market each one alone. I think in many respects, that's no longer our model if it ever was. I think the principal model today is we go to market through our loyalty platform through our dotcom site, through our app. And those things allow us to essentially market a portfolio and offer, through that portfolio, an incredible range of choice to our customers, which drives actually conversion from looking to booking that much higher and makes the economics of each brand better, not weaker. And so you put all that together and I think that's why we conclude that we're going to keep these brands and we're going to continue to grow them.

But I -- let's keep it maybe a little bit general and maybe we can even back up a little bit. When we were in the summer time with significant news about whether we get approval and how long it was taking, one of the New York tabloids ran a story suggesting that we had buyer's remorse and maybe didn't really want to close the deal. That story had 0 factual support, absolutely 0 factual support. We never lost any enthusiasm for completing this transaction. And now 6 weeks from close, 7 weeks from close I guess this Friday, we are enthusiastic as ever. And I think when you look at the report that we issued last night, we've been talking about this morning, what we see is a combined company with leverage levels already back to the levels that we target long term, with an enormous ability to produce cash and we'll be back in the market with that cash buying back our stock. But we also see and look at the third quarter EPS growth results and Legacy-Marriott because that's the only sort of apples-to-apples comparison we can do, but you're in a high teens percentage growth year-over-year. And we think the model's working extraordinarily well. We think the strength of the Starwood brands and the Starwood loyalty program have continued to impress us. And we should see that, that development engine and the share of wallet we are enjoying from our customers should continue to expand. So we are very pumped up and eager to go."

So kind of in and of itself, you've got the scenario that we are in a better situation relative to the debt than we had expected prior. I think the other thing I would point out is that earlier when we were looking, we had less comfort about knowing the details around their cash globally. And as a result of during the entity restructuring that I described earlier, we are comfortable that we are going to be able to use all of the debt -- all the cash balances that we don't need to run our business to repay debt and use for general corporate purposes over the near term. And I think that probably, when you compare it to where we were a number of months ago, we were, at the margin, a bit more cautious about knowing the details about what we would be able to do from a cash perspective."

I think the 3 biggest ones, as we described before, the 3 biggest changes to the 40 basis point improvement was, as we described, just more cash overall being able to feel comfortable about our access to that cash; the level of the EBITDAR, which is refined for both their higher owned, leased performance and frankly, the combination of the 2 companies' combined performance on the latest trailing 12-month; and then the third, that you were able to look at the actual amounts of cash that you have on hand."

And I don't want to go further than we're prepared to go. But I think the general point here is that the transaction was attractive to us, compelling to us in significant part because of what we think we could do with the loyalty programs. And those loyalty programs, managed well, should allow us to drive that much more of our business directly from our most loyal members, which is the cheapest business for us to book because it comes and books to us directly. And to -- you don't do that just by being nice and good-looking. You've got to do that by delivering real value to those customers because they're not going to be loyal to us unless it's in their interest to be loyal. And so we're working through those things. They include significant workaround systems and the like that we use to have our relationship with them but also how do we continue to make sure we're delivering value to them. And so free WiFi and member rates and mobile check-in and keyless entry and points, these are already things which are really available to our loyalty members but not to other customers.

But I think in that kind of operating environment, we'll probably see most of the hotels that are in the pipeline in the industry open ultimately, but the pipeline shrink in its entirety, which I would guess would mean that 2018 maybe is peak in the U.S. Obviously, if you've got a stronger GDP environment than that, more projects will be started. And at some point, you'll hit a place where the total pipeline sort of stays at the same kind of level or conceivably could grow, in which case peak supply growth could be later than that.

Think about particularly markets in which select-serve tells are much more prominent than full-service hotels. Starwood had obviously some Four Points, a few Alofts and precious few Elements but you compare the number of those 3 brands that Starwood had across the United States with what Marriott had in Courtyard and SpringHill Suites and Residence Inn and Fairfield and the like, and there are thousands more places for those customers to stay with us now broadly defined as the new Marriott. And as a consequence, we should drive more share. And with that greater distribution, the loyalty program itself becomes more powerful. Obviously, one of the things that customers look for is what are the benefits I get in terms of suite upgrades or bonus points or access to lounges or other things? But also can I stay within that network regularly when I travel so that I can earn the kind of status and earn the number of points that I need in order to really get the free vacations or to get the other things that I want to get with those points?

And we, of course, tried to be reassuring in the words that we used. In a cynical era, I think people are not inclined necessarily to believe everything that's said. And so one of the things we did is with the Marriott Reward program, in second quarter, if I remember right, we started doing suite upgrades and late checkout. And that was actually a powerful communication to the SPG members that, ""Oh actually, Marriott is paying attention to what Starwood has provided to us for some period of time.""

But if you look at the portfolio as a whole, the full-service hotels get disproportionate benefit from group business, and group business is stronger than corporate transient, particularly today. The managed select-service portfolio also skews, not as much as the full-service hotels but skews a little bit more towards group than the franchise select-service portfolio does. And so that's helpful too. And I think the third thing is around geographic distribution. So when you look at select-service, when you look at the franchise portfolio, when you look at a lot of industry data, select-service hotels can skew more towards oil and gas markets. Think about markets that nobody had never heard of before a couple of years ago like Williston, North Dakota and environs where you got all this oil work that's happening out there, select-service hotels exploded onto the scene. There's not a single full-service hotel in the whole area basically and maybe a little less dramatic in markets like Houston. But you look across Texas, you look across many of these markets and you'll see that those hotels are competing in, on average, tougher markets again without the benefit of group and that would be the bulk of the explanation."

And part of that, I'd say roughly half of that, was associated with moving several of those hotels into the assets held for sale category, which is again going to impact D&A but is not going to impact the owned hotels net. So specific numbers, we'll be able to talk more about in February. I think for now, the EBITDA is probably the easier way to think about it. Obviously, when we sell these hotels, we'll end up with a great stream of management fees in managing the hotels. So it's one thing to keep in mind is that although there is EBITDA that goes to the buyer of these assets, we're going to continue to have a great stream of earnings from them."

Obviously, the U.S. assets are easiest to predict but we've got some owned assets in other markets around the world. On average though, you would expect that the sales prices we received should be at least at the EBITDA level, if not higher, that the company is trading at. And so the transaction should be accretive from an EBITDA perspective. And when you look at it from an earnings perspective after depreciation associated with owned hotels, they should be significantly accretive from an earnings perspective. Now again, that's on average. We're not saying necessarily that in a higher cap rate market where the risk profile is actually quite different that we will necessarily always get proceeds which are higher than our EBITDA multiple. But I think generally across the average, we should see that this is accretive to the P&L and the balance sheet of the company."

So we do have in this headquarters building someplace, I'm sure, a detailed schedule of when we think hotels are going to open. But we're not rolling that out necessarily in a way that's very digestible by quarter. Having said that, I would think to the earlier question about when supply growth will peak. I suspect we are continuing to see, on average, that we're opening more next year than this year, and we're probably opening more in '18 than in '17, which would suggest that there will be some back-end skewing next year. I don't think it will be profound though. Obviously, we've opened a lot of hotels this year. We've missed a little bit this year and those are slipping into '17 but there'll be in early '17. And so I think the year as a whole should be fairly robust in terms of its openings. But again, I'd suspect fourth quarter will have more than the first quarter did simply because we continue to ramp. On fee growth, obviously, the 2 biggest inputs to the year-over-year fee growth is unit growth and RevPAR. And with 6% unit growth and 0% to 2% RevPAR growth, both can drive an increase in the top line. Although it's obvious that the rooms growth will drive more top line growth than the RevPAR growth unless we're wildly conservative in that 0% to 2% number. The next piece of that is what happens with incentive fees. And I think there, you end up in a 0% to 2% market with the real need to say, ""Okay, what's happening in the high incentive fee markets for the company like New York, like Washington, like London."" And other markets around the world. And until we do the budgets, that's going to be hard to give you much guidance.

Welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. For those in the U.S., happy Election Day. We're pleased you're taking the time to listen to our earnings call, but we hope you also get to the polls today.
Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, November 8, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
There are several topics we want to cover today, including our third quarter financial results, third quarter business trends, fourth quarter guidance and our early look into 2017. But first, we want to talk about the Starwood acquisition and the integration.
This is the first earnings call for the new Marriott International. On September 23, we completed the most transformational transaction in the company's history. Including the pipeline, our global system encompasses nearly 1.6 million guestrooms today.
Our near-term priorities are straight forward. Reach out to associates to knit the company together culturally, seize as soon as possible top line synergies, property cost efficiencies and $250 million in G&A savings, and do all this while remaining focused on our ongoing business, providing great experiences for our guests and driving returns for our owners and franchisees.
Off to a fast start, our team did what no other large consumer company has accomplished. Within minutes after the merger closed, we linked 3 enormous loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest, further announcing that we would match member status between the programs. We immediately enabled our loyal travelers to earn points in one program and redeem in the other. In fact, over 3.3 billion points were transferred between the programs in the first month alone, while the first transfer and redemption reservation occurred just 15 minutes after we closed the transaction.
That effort did not go unnoticed by customers and commentators. Blogger Gary Leff, who writes View from the Wing, noted to his readers that, ""No program has ever set up a mechanism to link accounts this quickly."" And my favorite quote came from a loyalty member who tweeted, ""Don't know if I'm more excited about linking Marriott Rewards or the fact that pumpkin spiced lattes are back.""
Doing the loyalty programs right has been a big priority for us since the deal was announced. Today, we are pleased to confirm that only 16% of our combined 85 million members were members of both programs prior to the merger. This puts us in a tremendous position to capture incremental business.
Immediately after closing, we also reached out to our largest B2B customers to tell them the great news and to begin cross-selling across our 30 brands. For our group business, we have seen over 1,000 lead referrals through the end of October between the Starwood and Marriott portfolios.
We are moving quickly to reduce costs, both in G&A as well as costs for our hotels. Procurement is a near-term opportunity. Starwood-managed hotels will begin transitioning to Avendra, the purchasing platform used by Legacy-Marriott Hotels and many other companies, in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Next year, we should see savings on OTA contracts. With its greater scale, Marriott has historically been able to obtain more attractive OTA contract terms. While savings to Starwood Hotels will vary by region, applying Marriott's contract terms should save Starwood owners OTA commissions, even assuming no change in OTA usage, with more savings expected in 2018.
We know that you are anxious to hear much more about our integration strategy and synergy opportunities, but let us ask you for your patience. The hotel business is about the details. Every market is different and every property is different. We can tell you we've reviewed and assimilated a tremendous amount of information from Starwood over the last 6 weeks and that we remain as enthusiastic about the transaction as ever.
While the deal is very exciting, we are also focused on business fundamentals. While reported third quarter financial results included only 8 days of Starwood results, today's outlook is drawn from an analysis of operating trends at both companies for all 3 months of the quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2017 reflects the combined company.
Clearly, North American demand continues -- demand growth continues to moderate. In the third quarter, hotels with the weakest RevPAR were generally in oil and gas markets or in gateway cities affected by continued weak international visitation or impacted by new supply. In the quarter, both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood portfolios did well in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Toronto and Washington, D.C., while both portfolios saw RevPAR declines in Houston, New York and San Francisco. On a combined basis, North America company-operated group RevPAR increased nearly 7%, benefiting from strong demand and a favorable holiday comparison.
Catering revenue continues to be strong. New group business is encouraging too. In the third quarter alone, Marriott and Starwood's sales organizations booked a combined 3.6 million room nights for future periods. Measured by booked group revenue, the 2 companies booked 6% more business than in the prior year, with particular strength for stays in 2018 and beyond.
In contrast, corporate customers are clearly cautious. In our last earnings call, we mentioned a trend in room sales among Legacy-Marriott's largest 300 corporate customers in North America, from 4% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2% in the first quarter to less than 1% growth in the second quarter. For this quarter, room revenue from Legacy-Marriott's top 300 customers was flat year-over-year as higher demand from professional services, retail and health care firms was offset by lower demand from technology, financial, energy and manufacturing companies.
Looking ahead in North America, fourth quarter group RevPAR pace for our company-operated Marriott and Starwood full-service hotels is down about 5%, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons combined with weak near-term corporate bookings. With greater availability, transient business should improve year-over-year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR for the combined system-wide Marriott and Starwood portfolios in North America will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Outside the U.S., third quarter performance of the Marriott and Starwood brands was very similar when adjusting for differences in geographic distribution. Across both portfolios in the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR growth was very strong in Brazil and Mexico, but was constrained by Zika in the Caribbean, weak economic growth in South America and new supply in Central America. For the fourth quarter, we expect Zika will continue to be a problem for the combined portfolio. And without the Olympics, we expect Brazil hotels will more acutely feel the effect of their weak economy. As a result, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our hotels in the region will be flattish with the prior year.
In the Middle East and Africa, easy Ramadan comparisons took Marriott and Starwood RevPAR higher in the third quarter, along with greater leisure business in South Africa and strong regional demand in Cairo. At the same time, many oil markets remained weak. Without the benefit of a holiday shift, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our combined portfolio in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate.
In the Asia Pacific region, Marriott and Starwood saw third quarter RevPAR improvement in India, South Korea and Shanghai, with declines in the Maldives, Macau and tertiary markets in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio should be flattish year-over-year, constrained by the cancellations that followed the death of the king in Thailand. 
In Europe, Marriott and Starwood occupancy in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul was weak in the third quarter, while our U.K. properties welcomed a greater number of Middle East travelers in the quarter. Hotels in Poland, Russia and Spain reported strong RevPAR growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio to be flattish year-over-year due to lingering terrorism concerns, weak group pace in London, Paris and Amsterdam and tougher comparisons in Poland and Russia.
Bottom line, we expect worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead to 2017, our North America outlook assumes a steady-as-she-goes economy and modestly higher supply growth. For the 2017 full year, North America revenue group pace for company-operated full-service hotels across the Marriott and Starwood portfolios is currently up about 2%.
For transient business, we expect current weak corporate demand to persist, although comparisons should get easier. We are targeting a higher volume of special corporate rate business for the coming year and expect special corporate room rates for comparable customers to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in most markets.
We are aggressively marketing to leisure guests and adding contract business at attractive rates. As a result, for 2017, we expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, North American fee revenue from the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 70% of worldwide fee revenue.
Outside North America in 2017, we expect incremental constant dollar system-wide RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America regions should also be flat to up 2%, reflecting good performance in Mexico and Central America. In 2015, Caribbean and Latin America pro forma fee revenue from the Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 4% of worldwide total fee revenue.
For the Middle East and Africa region, South Africa and Cairo should be strong, but we also see continued weak oil markets and risk of political disruption. As a result, we believe RevPAR will be flattish in the region in 2017. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Marriott's and Starwood's Middle East and Africa region contributed 5% of worldwide fee revenue.
For 2017, the combined portfolio in the Asia Pacific region should see continued strength in India and Shanghai more than offsetting weakness in Macau and tertiary markets in China, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low to mid-single-digit rate. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Asia Pacific region fee revenue totaled 13% of worldwide fee revenue, with about half of that coming from Greater China.
And finally, for Europe, we expect low single-digit RevPAR growth in 2017, with particular strength in Southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Europe contributed 8% of worldwide fee revenue. On a worldwide basis, we expect 2017 RevPAR will be flat to up 2%.
Turning to development. For 2016, we expect our combined company should grow global rooms distribution by roughly 5%, net of deletions. Project delays at both Marriott and Starwood have pushed a few openings to early 2017, but new deal signings remain very strong. As of quarter-end, our combined pipeline totaled nearly 420,000 rooms. For 2017, rooms growth should accelerate to roughly 6%, net of deletions.
In the U.S., the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolio represent 14% of open rooms, yet we have an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in the U.S. and 23% of rooms under construction worldwide. To be sure, leverage levels on new construction loans have moderated and construction costs are also increasing. While these conditions are not likely to change supply growth in the near-term, we believe they should discourage marginal new projects from moving forward. They should also enhance our share of new construction as lenders continue to favor the strongest brands. Incidentally, our combined portfolio of hotels gained RevPAR index globally in the third quarter and we are optimistic that we will see further gains as we realize revenue synergies.
We continue to be optimistic about the Starwood acquisitions. Six weeks after closing, we have accomplished a great deal. We will continue to do the hard work necessary to be the best hospitality company for our owners, franchisees, associates, guests and for you, our investors.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on fourth quarter and 2017. As I do, let me first offer my thanks to Leeny and the finance teams across Marriott and Legacy-Starwood. Closing our acquisition just 8 days before the end of the quarter was not ideal, but they scrambled and they did it beautifully. Thank you, all. Leeny?"

As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26. GAAP results were constrained by $237 million of merger-related costs, including $186 million of severance and retention costs, $24 million of transition costs, $18 million of transaction costs and $9 million of interest expense, partially offset by the 8 days of Starwood's operating results.
To provide visibility into Legacy-Marriott's performance in the quarter, we've adjusted third quarter results by backing out the 8 days of Legacy-Starwood results and merger-related costs as well as conforming the share count. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Legacy-Marriott business totaled $0.91, a 17% increase over the prior year.
Compared to our July 27 guidance, adjusted fee revenue was $6 million below the midpoint of expectations due to more modest RevPAR growth and lower than expected application and relicensing fees. Still, on an adjusted basis, our operating income of $378 million exceeded our guidance of $370 million to $375 million as we saw good performance on our owned, leased and other net line, lower than expected depreciation and amortization expense and better than expected G&A spending due to solid cost controls and some open positions.
Adjusted fee revenue for the Legacy-Marriott business increased 6%, with incentive fees up 13% in the third quarter. While Legacy-Marriott RevPAR and unit growth drove fees higher, fees were constrained by $9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Worldwide, house profit margins for Legacy-Marriott increased 90 basis points for company-operated hotels as many hotels are already focused on cost containment in a slower RevPAR growth environment. Strong results on our owned and leased hotels reflected recently completed renovations in Tokyo and Charlotte, the addition of 2 new hotels in Rio de Janeiro which benefited from the Olympics and stronger branding fees.
Adjusted G&A increased 3% year-over-year. The increase in interest income reflected a larger portfolio of loans.
Marriott's third quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $474 million, a 10% increase over the prior year.
So let's talk some more about the transaction. We presented selected pro forma third quarter information on Page A-16 of the press release, assuming the Starwood acquisition and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business had been completed on January 1, 2015, but using the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. Incidentally, we expect to provide a more detailed pro forma income statement for historic quarters in the next couple of months after we fine-tune purchase accounting estimates.
So combining Marriott's and Starwood's information, pro forma fee revenue totaled $723 million for the third quarter, an increase of 5.5% over the prior year, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct costs, totaled $166 million, an increase of more than 21%. As I mentioned earlier, Marriott owned and leased hotels benefited from recently completed renovations in the Olympics in the third quarter. Results for Legacy-Starwood owned and leased hotels were also strong, particularly in Hawaii, Toronto and Brazil. Starwood RevPAR at comparable worldwide owned and leased hotels increased more than 8% in the third quarter, with particularly strong profit flow-through.
For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue should total $695 million to $705 million, an increase of 1% to 2% over prior year pro forma fees. Our fee growth reflects roughly 5% unit growth. Fees are growing slower than unit due to modest RevPAR growth in North America, lower RevPAR in the Middle East and resulting lower profit flow-through and a modest decline in incentive fees. We also expect some negative FX impact of several contract changes and some givebacks of IMF recognized earlier in 2016.
We expect fourth quarter owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, should total roughly $150 million to $155 million. In the year-ago quarter, pro forma owned, leased and other net included $3 million from hotels that have since been sold by Starwood and $11 million in termination fees.
While Arne outlined our RevPAR expectations for the fourth quarter and 2017, in case you have a different view, we estimate that 1 point change in our RevPAR outlook across today's combined Marriott-Starwood system, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million for owned, leased and other net.
We expect depreciation and amortization will total $70 million to $75 million. Excluding merger-related costs, we expect G&A to total $235 million to $240 million in the fourth quarter, 16% to 18% lower than the pro forma prior year. Our anticipated fourth quarter 2016 G&A result should benefit from $8 million from a legal settlement, while the pro forma fourth quarter 2015 G&A included $5 million in Marriott merger-related costs. Fourth quarter operating income should total $530 million to $555 million, a 9% to 14% improvement over 2015 pro forma levels.
As Arne described, we're working hard to integrate the companies as quickly as possible. We expect to finalize the organization's structure for most regions and departments during the fourth quarter, but some may not be complete and in place until mid-2017. During 2017, we will also have wind-down costs included in G&A related to some duplicate systems, facilities and other areas of overlap. As a result, estimating quarter-to-quarter G&A in 2017 is challenging, but we expect to see significant progress toward our expected $250 million in G&A savings during the year. We expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by 2018.
For depreciation and amortization, you may recall that we estimated Marriott's stand-alone depreciation and amortization at roughly $130 million for 2016 during our last earnings call. In the 8-K filed on March 25, 2016, we estimated a run rate for incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction would total $209 million annually. Combined with Marriott's stand-alone D&A would imply a $339 million annual D&A run rate for the combined company.
Now that the transaction is closed, we've completed the preliminary allocation of our purchase price to the fair value of Starwood's assets and liabilities, which will be included in our upcoming 10-Q, likely to be filed tomorrow. This current view puts incremental D&A at closer to $140 million to $150 million annually and puts total D&A for the combined company at a roughly $270 million to $280 million run rate.
Compared to our prior depreciation and amortization estimate, our current view reflects updated information, a refined analysis of the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the impact of Starwood's successful asset sales year-to-date and the classification of several owned assets today as assets held for sale.
Purchase accounting rules provide a time frame of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition. Therefore, in the coming year, there could be changes to these allocations and resulting catch-ups could impact our P&L on the D&A line.
We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. For the full year of 2016, we estimate actual investment spending will total $425 million to $475 million. Included in this amount is roughly $75 million for investment spending for Legacy-Starwood brands in the fourth quarter. The Legacy-Marriott amount is about $125 million lower than last quarter's estimate, largely due to fewer development-related investments than previously expected.
When we announced the proposed acquisition of Starwood, we outlined the opportunity to sell owned hotels for $1.5 billion to $2 billion over 2 years. Of this amount, Starwood has already completed the sale of 5 hotels for $325 million. Today, we own 15 hotels operating under the Starwood brand. In 2016, we believe these owned hotels could generate EBITDA of approximately $180 million to $190 million. Eight of the hotels are in North America, with the remainder largely located in Latin America. We believe we can monetize these hotels for north of $1.5 billion, with the North American assets likely to be sold relatively faster.
We also believe there may be an opportunity to monetize some of Starwood's joint venture interests, which could recycle additional capital. At this time, we aren't prepared to offer an estimate of proceeds.
Our balance sheet is in a better position than we anticipated. As you know, the transaction took over 10 months from announcement to closing. During this time, both companies accumulated cash from operations as well as proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction, Starwood used excess cash to reduce debt balances by nearly $800 million. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, Marriott had $8.8 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash.
As part of the acquisition, we reorganized the company's entity structure to facilitate the combined companies' global operation. Given the new entity structure put in place as part of this reorganization, we expect global cash balances will continue to decline in the near-term.
Our debt ratio at September 30 is better than our earlier forecast by roughly 40 basis points, driven fairly equally by improved EBITDAR, higher overall cash balances from the delay in the transaction, higher confidence in our ability to use all of Starwood's cash and then, to a lesser extent, better estimates of our increased lease commitments as a result of the transaction.
We believe today that we are within the range of our targeted 3 to 3.25 adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR credit standards, excluding the impact of merger-related costs and charges. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.

I think it's still relatively early in assessing the impact of this. What we've seen so far is encouraging to us, but I think, fairly, we don't have statistics that we can use that would prove to you that we have delivered true success from this yet. But the early statistics, we see a high level of sign-ups, I think something like 800,000 or 900,000 incremental Marriott Rewards sign-ups since member-only rates were launched.
I think we are getting through the din of the marketing battles. As we've talked about in the past, there was a perception that rates at our hotels were cheaper on channels other than our own, which has not been true for well over a decade, and we wanted to really find a way to break through that noise and make sure folks knew that they could get competitive rates by booking directly with us. And going so far as to say there's a bit of a discount actually if you book directly with us we thought was a powerful way to get there.
And so we're seeing good pickup of that marketing message, good stickiness with the loyalty program. Obviously, though, the discounts are available to folks who would have booked directly previously as well as folks who might be booking directly now for the first time, and that has -- continues to have a very modest impact on RevPAR. We think, in Q3, probably about 30 basis points. And we'll watch this as we go forward. Obviously, this is something we talk with our owners about with some regularity. And I think, generally, the community to include us and our owner partners is supportive of continuing to pursue this. So it's all systems go."

Having said that, listening to the words that they used and going through our own press, I think there's a couple of things that we would say. One is I think we would be providing exactly the same guidance if we were simply Legacy-Marriott. So the first thing to point out is this is not a range which is driven by the recently completed merger with Starwood.
I think the second thing, and my guess is this is more or less the full explanation you'll get, is that we expect GDP to continue with the sort of anemic numbers that have been posted in 2016 as we go into 2017 and beyond. And it sounded as if one of our largest competitors was expecting a rebound of some sort in GDP. We're hope -- we hope they're right. Obviously, if GDP performs stronger, that will increase demand strength in our business, but we're building a model that essentially assumes we'll continue to bump along at the levels we're -- we've been at."

I mean, I think it's faster than we would have expected. If you go back to the full year, I think we started, and Laura can maybe pull this out as we talk, but I think we started 2016 with group business up almost 10% for 2017 compared to where we were at the first of 2015 for 2016. And I think we cautioned folks that, that was not likely to hold because as we got farther into the year, we would see that we could book less because we had less capacity. And so we expected that we would tail down towards the maybe mid to high single digits. But I think the experience in the last quarter or so, going from roughly 7% to roughly 2%, is worse than we anticipated.
I think there are a couple of -- one positive thing that can be said next to that, when you look at bookings done in Q3 for all future periods, we were up about 8%, if memory serves. So people are still making commitments on group business and there is good growth. But when you look at the near-term, when you look at group bookings in the year -- for the year or you look at group bookings for the next 12 months, we see less robustness there. And, to us, that's a sign of some caution by corporate customers probably particularly who -- in a sense, that's where group business gets most like corporate transient business, too. And there, I think we're seeing companies be just a bit cautious and probably reflect the sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we've been all operating in."

And in general, I would say it's just that the deals continue to move forward, but they've been pushed out a little bit. So I don't think it's a reflection of deals dropping away, but more that they're taking a bit longer to put together. It ties in with what you're hearing in the lending environment that lenders are, at the margin, a bit more cautious. And as we are looking at, in some cases, putting in mezzanine loans, they're taking a bit longer to put the deals together, but they continue to be in our pipeline and we look forward to doing them as we move forward."

Legacy-Marriott had strong owned, leased performance for its owned, leased hotels and then particularly strong performance on the branding fee side where we've had meaningful growth year-over-year compared to '15. As you go into '17, we're just in the process of putting our budget together now and we wouldn't really be able to comment on anything specifically. But as you look at kind of tough comps across the board, again, we're continuing to look for our owned, leased portfolios to do well. And for the branding fees to continue, we've got a great pipeline of projects to continue to do well.
I think that the part I would point out is the owned, leased portfolio on the Starwood side, we clearly are seeing the impact of their sold hotels. So as you look at that going forward, you would see the owned, leased profits related to that, that would kind of, on a year-over-year basis, from '17 to '16, decline, and then you probably got a couple of one-off like the Olympics in 2016. But, again, the biggest impact, I think, will be the change in owned hotels on Starwood's side."

That is not a conservative external target which looks different from the target that we've got internally. And so I would continue to look at that.
To state the obvious, with 8 days only of Starwood in Q3, I think it's difficult for you -- for us, let alone you, to conclude how much of that $250 million we've achieved so far. But we're getting underway, we're getting underway very quickly. And as you could tell from our preliminary comments, we're really trying to set up the organization as quickly as we possibly can so that the change to people is behind us and so that people can be looking forward. And so we'll move it.
I think, just to state the obvious, 2017 will be a bit messy because we'll have transaction and transition costs that will help you understand as each quarter is reported. They're a bit difficult, really, honestly for us to predict by quarter at this point in time. But we remain optimistic by the time that we get towards sort of 12 months from closing, the lion's share of that $250 million, at least from a run rate basis, should have been achieved. We can't tell you sitting here today that we know for certain that every final dollar of that will be achieved by 12/31/17. I suspect there could be some areas where we're running duplicate systems or something else that creates some cross and slop in '18, but we'll be very close. And to the extent we don't achieve the year-end, we'll, I think, get it fairly quickly in 2018.
I think in terms of synergies for the hotels, both top line and bottom line, we talked obviously about the loyalty program. I think the early response from our customers about linking those programs and matching status is very comforting, and that is exactly the kind of response we want and expect will hopefully drive larger share of wallet for us with an even larger loyalty community. And obviously, that's what we're focused on.
And then, on the cost side, we obviously talked about procurement. We talked about OTA commissions. But we're looking at essentially every relationship that the 2 companies have, whether they be about cost of systems that are proprietary to us or third party contracts that we're trying to make sure we deliver using the economies of scale that we've got and think that we can deliver top and bottom line improvements for our hotel owners in both portfolios."

In terms of what kind of you're looking at across the board from the 2 companies having to suffer from everything from the Middle East to what would change in FX and the impact of RevPAR going forward. So I think it's overwhelmingly incentive fees. And base and franchise are going to look a lot more normal relative to the growth in unit than the growth in RevPAR. There are a few contract changes here and there that could impact the difference between franchise and managed per se, but overall when you look at base and franchise, they're going to look very much in line with what goes on with RevPAR and unit growth. It's really incentive fees where you're going to see this combination of effects. And the other thing again, year-over-year, when you kind of adjust and look for full year, I think that is important to look at because you've got some quarter-to-quarter variations that affect these. That when you look at the full year '16 to '15 on a combined legacy basis, you'll get something that looks much more like the single -- mid-single digits, which you would expect overall from the portfolio, given the RevPAR and unit growth."

First of all, clearly next year, with the kind of RevPAR that we've outlined, we would be thrilled to end up with flat margins. We have done an incredible job with margins in the RevPAR environment that we've had this year. And perhaps in some respects, you could argue that we've gotten margin that now we will be happy to keep in terms of the margin improvement. So I think on that standpoint, I wouldn't look to see higher IMFs as a result of any margin improvement with essentially what is a pretty low RevPAR environment. Now we would expect to have unit growth and we expect to have unit growth internationally, which is going to obviously help our IMF, given the construct of our contracts there. Where it is tough to predict is this issue of where. For example, when you look at the Middle East this particular quarter that we're looking at, in Q4 you clearly see the dramatic impact of lower RevPAR on our IMFs as we go into Q4. So I think that's where we need to get into the details on our budgeting process to look at the trade-off between unit growth internationally as well as RevPAR as well as then the performance of specific markets and what happens to their IMFs. So it's possible but certainly too soon to tell at this point."

And we don't have the power to nor the desire to try and convince them that those bets have not been good bets. I think the other thing that's really important to recognize here if we -- the biggest expense from a brand perspective in theory is about marketing brands. And obviously, that's the most expensive when each brand has to be marketed on its own. And in that context, you would want as much definition as you could have between brands, and it would still be expensive to go out and market each one alone. I think in many respects, that's no longer our model if it ever was. I think the principal model today is we go to market through our loyalty platform through our dotcom site, through our app. And those things allow us to essentially market a portfolio and offer, through that portfolio, an incredible range of choice to our customers, which drives actually conversion from looking to booking that much higher and makes the economics of each brand better, not weaker. And so you put all that together and I think that's why we conclude that we're going to keep these brands and we're going to continue to grow them. I don't really think that there are material incremental costs to having a brand, given that, that's the business model that we have."

I think the 3 biggest ones, as we described before, the 3 biggest changes to the 40 basis point improvement was, as we described, just more cash overall being able to feel comfortable about our access to that cash; the level of the EBITDAR, which is refined for both their higher owned, leased performance and frankly, the combination of the 2 companies' combined performance on the latest trailing 12-month; and then the third, that you were able to look at the actual amounts of cash that you have on hand."

And I don't want to go further than we're prepared to go. But I think the general point here is that the transaction was attractive to us, compelling to us in significant part because of what we think we could do with the loyalty programs. And those loyalty programs, managed well, should allow us to drive that much more of our business directly from our most loyal members, which is the cheapest business for us to book because it comes and books to us directly. And to -- you don't do that just by being nice and good-looking. You've got to do that by delivering real value to those customers because they're not going to be loyal to us unless it's in their interest to be loyal. And so we're working through those things. They include significant workaround systems and the like that we use to have our relationship with them but also how do we continue to make sure we're delivering value to them. And so free WiFi and member rates and mobile check-in and keyless entry and points, these are already things which are really available to our loyalty members but not to other customers. And we'll continue to make sure that we're managing that in a way that hopefully will give us good protection against whatever sort of either threatening intermediaries or newfangled ideas that come out that are seeking to upend that relationship."

So if GDP bumps along at 1%-ish in the U.S. for the next year or 2, I suspect we'll see more hotels open than are signed to the pipeline for the industry. Obviously, the trick here is for a company like ours to do better than the industry does, and we'll continue to be focused on that. But I think in that kind of operating environment, we'll probably see most of the hotels that are in the pipeline in the industry open ultimately, but the pipeline shrink in its entirety, which I would guess would mean that 2018 maybe is peak in the U.S. Obviously, if you've got a stronger GDP environment than that, more projects will be started. And at some point, you'll hit a place where the total pipeline sort of stays at the same kind of level or conceivably could grow, in which case peak supply growth could be later than that. Take that for what it is, which is an off the cuff answer."

Think about particularly markets in which select-serve tells are much more prominent than full-service hotels. Starwood had obviously some Four Points, a few Alofts and precious few Elements but you compare the number of those 3 brands that Starwood had across the United States with what Marriott had in Courtyard and SpringHill Suites and Residence Inn and Fairfield and the like, and there are thousands more places for those customers to stay with us now broadly defined as the new Marriott. And as a consequence, we should drive more share. And with that greater distribution, the loyalty program itself becomes more powerful. Obviously, one of the things that customers look for is what are the benefits I get in terms of suite upgrades or bonus points or access to lounges or other things? But also can I stay within that network regularly when I travel so that I can earn the kind of status and earn the number of points that I need in order to really get the free vacations or to get the other things that I want to get with those points?

When we announced the deal in November of '15 because Marriott was the acquirer, SPG members particularly were a bit nervous about, ""Okay, what is Marriott going to do to the benefits that we like?"" And we, of course, tried to be reassuring in the words that we used. In a cynical era, I think people are not inclined necessarily to believe everything that's said. And so one of the things we did is with the Marriott Reward program, in second quarter, if I remember right, we started doing suite upgrades and late checkout. And that was actually a powerful communication to the SPG members that, ""Oh actually, Marriott is paying attention to what Starwood has provided to us for some period of time."" And that's a reassuring sign. But we'll look at suite upgrades and redemption rules and all these other aspects over the course of the next few years and try and do right by our customers and obviously do right by the program."

But if you look at the portfolio as a whole, the full-service hotels get disproportionate benefit from group business, and group business is stronger than corporate transient, particularly today. The managed select-service portfolio also skews, not as much as the full-service hotels but skews a little bit more towards group than the franchise select-service portfolio does. And so that's helpful too. And I think the third thing is around geographic distribution. So when you look at select-service, when you look at the franchise portfolio, when you look at a lot of industry data, select-service hotels can skew more towards oil and gas markets. Think about markets that nobody had never heard of before a couple of years ago like Williston, North Dakota and environs where you got all this oil work that's happening out there, select-service hotels exploded onto the scene. There's not a single full-service hotel in the whole area basically and maybe a little less dramatic in markets like Houston. But you look across Texas, you look across many of these markets and you'll see that those hotels are competing in, on average, tougher markets again without the benefit of group and that would be the bulk of the explanation."

At this point, we're really not in a position to kind of get super detailed. I think the easiest way to describe it is what we talked about from an EBITDA perspective, which is the $180 million to $190 million of EBITDA associated with Starwood's owned hotels. We also did talk about the fact that our depreciation and amortization estimates associated with the purchase of Starwood have declined relative to the earlier description. And part of that, I'd say roughly half of that, was associated with moving several of those hotels into the assets held for sale category, which is again going to impact D&A but is not going to impact the owned hotels net. So specific numbers, we'll be able to talk more about in February. I think for now, the EBITDA is probably the easier way to think about it. Obviously, when we sell these hotels, we'll end up with a great stream of management fees in managing the hotels. So it's one thing to keep in mind is that although there is EBITDA that goes to the buyer of these assets, we're going to continue to have a great stream of earnings from them."

On average though, you would expect that the sales prices we received should be at least at the EBITDA level, if not higher, that the company is trading at. And so the transaction should be accretive from an EBITDA perspective. And when you look at it from an earnings perspective after depreciation associated with owned hotels, they should be significantly accretive from an earnings perspective. Now again, that's on average. We're not saying necessarily that in a higher cap rate market where the risk profile is actually quite different that we will necessarily always get proceeds which are higher than our EBITDA multiple. But I think generally across the average, we should see that this is accretive to the P&L and the balance sheet of the company."

So we do have in this headquarters building someplace, I'm sure, a detailed schedule of when we think hotels are going to open. But we're not rolling that out necessarily in a way that's very digestible by quarter. Having said that, I would think to the earlier question about when supply growth will peak. I suspect we are continuing to see, on average, that we're opening more next year than this year, and we're probably opening more in '18 than in '17, which would suggest that there will be some back-end skewing to next year. I don't think it will be profound though. Obviously, we've opened a lot of hotels this year. We've missed a little bit this year and those are slipping into '17 but there'll be in early '17. And so I think the year as a whole should be fairly robust in terms of its openings. But again, I'd suspect fourth quarter will have more than the first quarter did simply because we continue to ramp. On fee growth, obviously, the 2 biggest inputs to the year-over-year fee growth is unit growth and RevPAR. And with 6% unit growth and 0% to 2% RevPAR growth, both can drive an increase in the top line. Although it's obvious that the rooms growth will drive more top line growth than the RevPAR growth unless we're wildly conservative in that 0% to 2% number. The next piece of that is what happens with incentive fees. And I think there, you end up in a 0% to 2% market with the real need to say, ""Okay, what's happening in the high incentive fee markets for the company like New York, like Washington, like London."" And other markets around the world. And until we do the budgets, that's going to be hard to give you much guidance.

These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.
Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, November 8, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor.
There are several topics we want to cover today, including our third quarter financial results, third quarter business trends, fourth quarter guidance and our early look into 2017. But first, we want to talk about the Starwood acquisition and the integration.
This is the first earnings call for the new Marriott International. On September 23, we completed the most transformational transaction in the company's history. Including the pipeline, our global system encompasses nearly 1.6 million guestrooms today.
Our near-term priorities are straight forward. Reach out to associates to knit the company together culturally, seize as soon as possible top line synergies, property cost efficiencies and $250 million in G&A savings, and do all this while remaining focused on our ongoing business, providing great experiences for our guests and driving returns for our owners and franchisees.
Off to a fast start, our team did what no other large consumer company has accomplished. Within minutes after the merger closed, we linked 3 enormous loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest, further announcing that we would match member status between the programs. We immediately enabled our loyal travelers to earn points in one program and redeem in the other. In fact, over 3.3 billion points were transferred between the programs in the first month alone, while the first transfer and redemption reservation occurred just 15 minutes after we closed the transaction.
That effort did not go unnoticed by customers and commentators. Blogger Gary Leff, who writes View from the Wing, noted to his readers that, ""No program has ever set up a mechanism to link accounts this quickly."" And my favorite quote came from a loyalty member who tweeted, ""Don't know if I'm more excited about linking Marriott Rewards or the fact that pumpkin spiced lattes are back.""
Doing the loyalty programs right has been a big priority for us since the deal was announced. Today, we are pleased to confirm that only 16% of our combined 85 million members were members of both programs prior to the merger. This puts us in a tremendous position to capture incremental business.
Immediately after closing, we also reached out to our largest B2B customers to tell them the great news and to begin cross-selling across our 30 brands. For our group business, we have seen over 1,000 lead referrals through the end of October between the Starwood and Marriott portfolios.
We are moving quickly to reduce costs, both in G&A as well as costs for our hotels. Procurement is a near-term opportunity. Starwood-managed hotels will begin transitioning to Avendra, the purchasing platform used by Legacy-Marriott Hotels and many other companies, in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Next year, we should see savings on OTA contracts. With its greater scale, Marriott has historically been able to obtain more attractive OTA contract terms. While savings to Starwood Hotels will vary by region, applying Marriott's contract terms should save Starwood owners OTA commissions, even assuming no change in OTA usage, with more savings expected in 2018.
We know that you are anxious to hear much more about our integration strategy and synergy opportunities, but let us ask you for your patience. The hotel business is about the details. Every market is different and every property is different. We can tell you we've reviewed and assimilated a tremendous amount of information from Starwood over the last 6 weeks and that we remain as enthusiastic about the transaction as ever.
While the deal is very exciting, we are also focused on business fundamentals. While reported third quarter financial results included only 8 days of Starwood results, today's outlook is drawn from an analysis of operating trends at both companies for all 3 months of the quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2017 reflects the combined company.
Clearly, North American demand continues -- demand growth continues to moderate. In the third quarter, hotels with the weakest RevPAR were generally in oil and gas markets or in gateway cities affected by continued weak international visitation or impacted by new supply. In the quarter, both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood portfolios did well in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Toronto and Washington, D.C., while both portfolios saw RevPAR declines in Houston, New York and San Francisco. On a combined basis, North America company-operated group RevPAR increased nearly 7%, benefiting from strong demand and a favorable holiday comparison.
Catering revenue continues to be strong. New group business is encouraging too. In the third quarter alone, Marriott and Starwood's sales organizations booked a combined 3.6 million room nights for future periods. Measured by booked group revenue, the 2 companies booked 6% more business than in the prior year, with particular strength for stays in 2018 and beyond.
In contrast, corporate customers are clearly cautious. In our last earnings call, we mentioned a trend in room sales among Legacy-Marriott's largest 300 corporate customers in North America, from 4% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2% in the first quarter to less than 1% growth in the second quarter. For this quarter, room revenue from Legacy-Marriott's top 300 customers was flat year-over-year as higher demand from professional services, retail and health care firms was offset by lower demand from technology, financial, energy and manufacturing companies.
Looking ahead in North America, fourth quarter group RevPAR pace for our company-operated Marriott and Starwood full-service hotels is down about 5%, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons combined with weak near-term corporate bookings. With greater availability, transient business should improve year-over-year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR for the combined system-wide Marriott and Starwood portfolios in North America will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Outside the U.S., third quarter performance of the Marriott and Starwood brands was very similar when adjusting for differences in geographic distribution. Across both portfolios in the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR growth was very strong in Brazil and Mexico, but was constrained by Zika in the Caribbean, weak economic growth in South America and new supply in Central America. For the fourth quarter, we expect Zika will continue to be a problem for the combined portfolio. And without the Olympics, we expect Brazil hotels will more acutely feel the effect of their weak economy. As a result, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our hotels in the region will be flattish with the prior year.
In the Middle East and Africa, easy Ramadan comparisons took Marriott and Starwood RevPAR higher in the third quarter, along with greater leisure business in South Africa and strong regional demand in Cairo. At the same time, many oil markets remained weak. Without the benefit of a holiday shift, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our combined portfolio in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate.
In the Asia Pacific region, Marriott and Starwood saw third quarter RevPAR improvement in India, South Korea and Shanghai, with declines in the Maldives, Macau and tertiary markets in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio should be flattish year-over-year, constrained by the cancellations that followed the death of the king in Thailand. 
In Europe, Marriott and Starwood occupancy in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul was weak in the third quarter, while our U.K. properties welcomed a greater number of Middle East travelers in the quarter. Hotels in Poland, Russia and Spain reported strong RevPAR growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio to be flattish year-over-year due to lingering terrorism concerns, weak group pace in London, Paris and Amsterdam and tougher comparisons in Poland and Russia.
Bottom line, we expect worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead to 2017, our North America outlook assumes a steady-as-she-goes economy and modestly higher supply growth. For the 2017 full year, North America revenue group pace for company-operated full-service hotels across the Marriott and Starwood portfolios is currently up about 2%.
For transient business, we expect current weak corporate demand to persist, although comparisons should get easier. We are targeting a higher volume of special corporate rate business for the coming year and expect special corporate room rates for comparable customers to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in most markets.
We are aggressively marketing to leisure guests and adding contract business at attractive rates. As a result, for 2017, we expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, North American fee revenue from the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 70% of worldwide fee revenue.
Outside North America in 2017, we expect incremental constant dollar system-wide RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America regions should also be flat to up 2%, reflecting good performance in Mexico and Central America. In 2015, Caribbean and Latin America pro forma fee revenue from the Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 4% of worldwide total fee revenue.
For the Middle East and Africa region, South Africa and Cairo should be strong, but we also see continued weak oil markets and risk of political disruption. As a result, we believe RevPAR will be flattish in the region in 2017. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Marriott's and Starwood's Middle East and Africa region contributed 5% of worldwide fee revenue.
For 2017, the combined portfolio in the Asia Pacific region should see continued strength in India and Shanghai more than offsetting weakness in Macau and tertiary markets in China, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low to mid-single-digit rate. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Asia Pacific region fee revenue totaled 13% of worldwide fee revenue, with about half of that coming from Greater China.
And finally, for Europe, we expect low single-digit RevPAR growth in 2017, with particular strength in Southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Europe contributed 8% of worldwide fee revenue. On a worldwide basis, we expect 2017 RevPAR will be flat to up 2%.
Turning to development. For 2016, we expect our combined company should grow global rooms distribution by roughly 5%, net of deletions. Project delays at both Marriott and Starwood have pushed a few openings to early 2017, but new deal signings remain very strong. As of quarter-end, our combined pipeline totaled nearly 420,000 rooms. For 2017, rooms growth should accelerate to roughly 6%, net of deletions.
In the U.S., the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolio represent 14% of open rooms, yet we have an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in the U.S. and 23% of rooms under construction worldwide. To be sure, leverage levels on new construction loans have moderated and construction costs are also increasing. While these conditions are not likely to change supply growth in the near-term, we believe they should discourage marginal new projects from moving forward. They should also enhance our share of new construction as lenders continue to favor the strongest brands. Incidentally, our combined portfolio of hotels gained RevPAR index globally in the third quarter and we are optimistic that we will see further gains as we realize revenue synergies.
We continue to be optimistic about the Starwood acquisitions. Six weeks after closing, we have accomplished a great deal. We will continue to do the hard work necessary to be the best hospitality company for our owners, franchisees, associates, guests and for you, our investors.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on fourth quarter and 2017. As I do, let me first offer my thanks to Leeny and the finance teams across Marriott and Legacy-Starwood. Closing our acquisition just 8 days before the end of the quarter was not ideal, but they scrambled and they did it beautifully. Thank you, all. Leeny?"
31148,403607503,1081576,"Marriott International, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2016",2016-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Marriott International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Arne.As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26.

As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26. GAAP results were constrained by $237 million of merger-related costs, including $186 million of severance and retention costs, $24 million of transition costs, $18 million of transaction costs and $9 million of interest expense, partially offset by the 8 days of Starwood's operating results.
To provide visibility into Legacy-Marriott's performance in the quarter, we've adjusted third quarter results by backing out the 8 days of Legacy-Starwood results and merger-related costs as well as conforming the share count. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Legacy-Marriott business totaled $0.91, a 17% increase over the prior year.
Compared to our July 27 guidance, adjusted fee revenue was $6 million below the midpoint of expectations due to more modest RevPAR growth and lower than expected application and relicensing fees. Still, on an adjusted basis, our operating income of $378 million exceeded our guidance of $370 million to $375 million as we saw good performance on our owned, leased and other net line, lower than expected depreciation and amortization expense and better than expected G&A spending due to solid cost controls and some open positions.
Adjusted fee revenue for the Legacy-Marriott business increased 6%, with incentive fees up 13% in the third quarter. While Legacy-Marriott RevPAR and unit growth drove fees higher, fees were constrained by $9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Worldwide, house profit margins for Legacy-Marriott increased 90 basis points for company-operated hotels as many hotels are already focused on cost containment in a slower RevPAR growth environment. Strong results on our owned and leased hotels reflected recently completed renovations in Tokyo and Charlotte, the addition of 2 new hotels in Rio de Janeiro which benefited from the Olympics and stronger branding fees.
Adjusted G&A increased 3% year-over-year. The increase in interest income reflected a larger portfolio of loans.
Marriott's third quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $474 million, a 10% increase over the prior year.
So let's talk some more about the transaction. We presented selected pro forma third quarter information on Page A-16 of the press release, assuming the Starwood acquisition and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business had been completed on January 1, 2015, but using the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. Incidentally, we expect to provide a more detailed pro forma income statement for historic quarters in the next couple of months after we fine-tune purchase accounting estimates.
So combining Marriott's and Starwood's information, pro forma fee revenue totaled $723 million for the third quarter, an increase of 5.5% over the prior year, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct costs, totaled $166 million, an increase of more than 21%. As I mentioned earlier, Marriott owned and leased hotels benefited from recently completed renovations in the Olympics in the third quarter. Results for Legacy-Starwood owned and leased hotels were also strong, particularly in Hawaii, Toronto and Brazil. Starwood RevPAR at comparable worldwide owned and leased hotels increased more than 8% in the third quarter, with particularly strong profit flow-through.
For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue should total $695 million to $705 million, an increase of 1% to 2% over prior year pro forma fees. Our fee growth reflects roughly 5% unit growth. Fees are growing slower than unit due to modest RevPAR growth in North America, lower RevPAR in the Middle East and resulting lower profit flow-through and a modest decline in incentive fees. We also expect some negative FX impact of several contract changes and some givebacks of IMF recognized earlier in 2016.
We expect fourth quarter owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, should total roughly $150 million to $155 million. In the year-ago quarter, pro forma owned, leased and other net included $3 million from hotels that have since been sold by Starwood and $11 million in termination fees.
While Arne outlined our RevPAR expectations for the fourth quarter and 2017, in case you have a different view, we estimate that 1 point change in our RevPAR outlook across today's combined Marriott-Starwood system, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million for owned, leased and other net.
We expect depreciation and amortization will total $70 million to $75 million. Excluding merger-related costs, we expect G&A to total $235 million to $240 million in the fourth quarter, 16% to 18% lower than the pro forma prior year. Our anticipated fourth quarter 2016 G&A result should benefit from $8 million from a legal settlement, while the pro forma fourth quarter 2015 G&A included $5 million in Marriott merger-related costs. Fourth quarter operating income should total $530 million to $555 million, a 9% to 14% improvement over 2015 pro forma levels.
As Arne described, we're working hard to integrate the companies as quickly as possible. We expect to finalize the organization's structure for most regions and departments during the fourth quarter, but some may not be complete and in place until mid-2017. During 2017, we will also have wind-down costs included in G&A related to some duplicate systems, facilities and other areas of overlap. As a result, estimating quarter-to-quarter G&A in 2017 is challenging, but we expect to see significant progress toward our expected $250 million in G&A savings during the year. We expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by 2018.
For depreciation and amortization, you may recall that we estimated Marriott's stand-alone depreciation and amortization at roughly $130 million for 2016 during our last earnings call. In the 8-K filed on March 25, 2016, we estimated a run rate for incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction would total $209 million annually. Combined with Marriott's stand-alone D&A would imply a $339 million annual D&A run rate for the combined company.
Now that the transaction is closed, we've completed the preliminary allocation of our purchase price to the fair value of Starwood's assets and liabilities, which will be included in our upcoming 10-Q, likely to be filed tomorrow. This current view puts incremental D&A at closer to $140 million to $150 million annually and puts total D&A for the combined company at a roughly $270 million to $280 million run rate.
Compared to our prior depreciation and amortization estimate, our current view reflects updated information, a refined analysis of the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the impact of Starwood's successful asset sales year-to-date and the classification of several owned assets today as assets held for sale.
Purchase accounting rules provide a time frame of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition. Therefore, in the coming year, there could be changes to these allocations and resulting catch-ups could impact our P&L on the D&A line.
We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. For the full year of 2016, we estimate actual investment spending will total $425 million to $475 million. Included in this amount is roughly $75 million for investment spending for Legacy-Starwood brands in the fourth quarter. The Legacy-Marriott amount is about $125 million lower than last quarter's estimate, largely due to fewer development-related investments than previously expected.
When we announced the proposed acquisition of Starwood, we outlined the opportunity to sell owned hotels for $1.5 billion to $2 billion over 2 years. Of this amount, Starwood has already completed the sale of 5 hotels for $325 million. Today, we own 15 hotels operating under the Starwood brand. In 2016, we believe these owned hotels could generate EBITDA of approximately $180 million to $190 million. Eight of the hotels are in North America, with the remainder largely located in Latin America. We believe we can monetize these hotels for north of $1.5 billion, with the North American assets likely to be sold relatively faster.
We also believe there may be an opportunity to monetize some of Starwood's joint venture interests, which could recycle additional capital. At this time, we aren't prepared to offer an estimate of proceeds.
Our balance sheet is in a better position than we anticipated. As you know, the transaction took over 10 months from announcement to closing. During this time, both companies accumulated cash from operations as well as proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction, Starwood used excess cash to reduce debt balances by nearly $800 million. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, Marriott had $8.8 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash.
As part of the acquisition, we reorganized the company's entity structure to facilitate the combined companies' global operation. Given the new entity structure put in place as part of this reorganization, we expect global cash balances will continue to decline in the near-term.
Our debt ratio at September 30 is better than our earlier forecast by roughly 40 basis points, driven fairly equally by improved EBITDAR, higher overall cash balances from the delay in the transaction, higher confidence in our ability to use all of Starwood's cash and then, to a lesser extent, better estimates of our increased lease commitments as a result of the transaction.
We believe today that we are within the range of our targeted 3 to 3.25 adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR credit standards, excluding the impact of merger-related costs and charges. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.
We know that you're eager for more information about the combined company. We will have much more to say about 2017 in February and when we hold our Analyst Day in March. But as you can tell, for now, we feel very good about our brands, our business and our progress in integrating Starwood.

I think it's still relatively early in assessing the impact of this. What we've seen so far is encouraging to us, but I think, fairly, we don't have statistics that we can use that would prove to you that we have delivered true success from this yet. But the early statistics, we see a high level of sign-ups, I think something like 800,000 or 900,000 incremental Marriott Rewards sign-ups since member-only rates were launched.
I think we are getting through the din of the marketing battles. As we've talked about in the past, there was a perception that rates at our hotels were cheaper on channels other than our own, which has not been true for well over a decade, and we wanted to really find a way to break through that noise and make sure folks knew that they could get competitive rates by booking directly with us. And going so far as to say there's a bit of a discount actually if you book directly with us we thought was a powerful way to get there.
And so we're seeing good pickup of that marketing message, good stickiness with the loyalty program. Obviously, though, the discounts are available to folks who would have booked directly previously as well as folks who might be booking directly now for the first time, and that has -- continues to have a very modest impact on RevPAR. We think, in Q3, probably about 30 basis points. And we'll watch this as we go forward. Obviously, this is something we talk with our owners about with some regularity. And I think, generally, the community to include us and our owner partners is supportive of continuing to pursue this. So it's all systems go."

Having said that, listening to the words that they used and going through our own press, I think there's a couple of things that we would say. One is I think we would be providing exactly the same guidance if we were simply Legacy-Marriott. So the first thing to point out is this is not a range which is driven by the recently completed merger with Starwood.
I think the second thing, and my guess is this is more or less the full explanation you'll get, is that we expect GDP to continue with the sort of anemic numbers that have been posted in 2016 as we go into 2017 and beyond. And it sounded as if one of our largest competitors was expecting a rebound of some sort in GDP. We're hope -- we hope they're right. Obviously, if GDP performs stronger, that will increase demand strength in our business, but we're building a model that essentially assumes we'll continue to bump along at the levels we're -- we've been at."

And I think we cautioned folks that, that was not likely to hold because as we got farther into the year, we would see that we could book less because we had less capacity. And so we expected that we would tail down towards the maybe mid to high single digits. But I think the experience in the last quarter or so, going from roughly 7% to roughly 2%, is worse than we anticipated.
I think there are a couple of -- one positive thing that can be said next to that, when you look at bookings done in Q3 for all future periods, we were up about 8%, if memory serves. So people are still making commitments on group business and there is good growth. But when you look at the near-term, when you look at group bookings in the year -- for the year or you look at group bookings for the next 12 months, we see less robustness there. And, to us, that's a sign of some caution by corporate customers probably particularly who -- in a sense, that's where group business gets most like corporate transient business, too. And there, I think we're seeing companies be just a bit cautious and probably reflect the sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we've been all operating in."

I think when you look overall, let's first talk a little bit about Legacy-Marriott. Legacy-Marriott had strong owned, leased performance for its owned, leased hotels and then particularly strong performance on the branding fee side where we've had meaningful growth year-over-year compared to '15. As you go into '17, we're just in the process of putting our budget together now and we wouldn't really be able to comment on anything specifically. But as you look at kind of tough comps across the board, again, we're continuing to look for our owned, leased portfolios to do well. And for the branding fees to continue, we've got a great pipeline of projects to continue to do well.
I think that the part I would point out is the owned, leased portfolio on the Starwood side, we clearly are seeing the impact of their sold hotels. So as you look at that going forward, you would see the owned, leased profits related to that, that would kind of, on a year-over-year basis, from '17 to '16, decline, and then you probably got a couple of one-off like the Olympics in 2016. But, again, the biggest impact, I think, will be the change in owned hotels on Starwood's side."

That is not a conservative external target which looks different from the target that we've got internally. And so I would continue to look at that.
To state the obvious, with 8 days only of Starwood in Q3, I think it's difficult for you -- for us, let alone you, to conclude how much of that $250 million we've achieved so far. But we're getting underway, we're getting underway very quickly. And as you could tell from our preliminary comments, we're really trying to set up the organization as quickly as we possibly can so that the change to people is behind us and so that people can be looking forward. And so we'll move it.
I think, just to state the obvious, 2017 will be a bit messy because we'll have transaction and transition costs that will help you understand as each quarter is reported. They're a bit difficult, really, honestly for us to predict by quarter at this point in time. But we remain optimistic by the time that we get towards sort of 12 months from closing, the lion's share of that $250 million, at least from a run rate basis, should have been achieved. We can't tell you sitting here today that we know for certain that every final dollar of that will be achieved by 12/31/17. I suspect there could be some areas where we're running duplicate systems or something else that creates some cross and slop in '18, but we'll be very close. And to the extent we don't achieve the year-end, we'll, I think, get it fairly quickly in 2018.
I think in terms of synergies for the hotels, both top line and bottom line, we talked obviously about the loyalty program. I think the early response from our customers about linking those programs and matching status is very comforting, and that is exactly the kind of response we want and expect will hopefully drive larger share of wallet for us with an even larger loyalty community. And obviously, that's what we're focused on.
And then, on the cost side, we obviously talked about procurement. We talked about OTA commissions. But we're looking at essentially every relationship that the 2 companies have, whether they be about cost of systems that are proprietary to us or third party contracts that we're trying to make sure we deliver using the economies of scale that we've got and think that we can deliver top and bottom line improvements for our hotel owners in both portfolios."

In terms of what kind of you're looking at across the board from the 2 companies having to suffer from everything from the Middle East to what would change in FX and the impact of RevPAR going forward. So I think it's overwhelmingly incentive fees. And base and franchise are going to look a lot more normal relative to the growth in unit than the growth in RevPAR. There are a few contract changes here and there that could impact the difference between franchise and managed per se, but overall when you look at base and franchise, they're going to look very much in line with what goes on with RevPAR and unit growth. It's really incentive fees where you're going to see this combination of effects. And the other thing again, year-over-year, when you kind of adjust and look for full year, I think that is important to look at because you've got some quarter-to-quarter variations that affect these.

First of all, clearly next year, with the kind of RevPAR that we've outlined, we would be thrilled to end up with flat margins. We have done an incredible job with margins in the RevPAR environment that we've had this year. And perhaps in some respects, you could argue that we've gotten margin that now we will be happy to keep in terms of the margin improvement. So I think on that standpoint, I wouldn't look to see higher IMFs as a result of any margin improvement with essentially what is a pretty low RevPAR environment. Now we would expect to have unit growth and we expect to have unit growth internationally, which is going to obviously help our IMF, given the construct of our contracts there. Where it is tough to predict is this issue of where. For example, when you look at the Middle East this particular quarter that we're looking at, in Q4 you clearly see the dramatic impact of lower RevPAR on our IMFs as we go into Q4. So I think that's where we need to get into the details on our budgeting process to look at the trade-off between unit growth internationally as well as RevPAR as well as then the performance of specific markets and what happens to their IMFs.

We are heavily involved in every single one of the systems that you described. I think kind of you can start at the easy place, which is thinking about the hotels and actually the way that they operate, and we are looking at putting them all onto the same back-office system that we have at the Marriott Hotels. And that's a process that we'll be getting into absolutely as soon as we can. As we look at the reservations and the loyalty platforms, clearly, there is a massive amount of work to be done, and it also -- we need to take into consideration our relationships with our credit card and timeshare partners and a lot of technology work in looking at what exactly it will take. So we can't give you a specific time frame yet on the exact timing but certainly moving in that direction. And as far as the -- kind of the fundamental systems of everything from company payroll and the way the hotels work, we are moving so that well into 2017, we will have everybody on the same system."

And maybe for Arne, there's been no shortage of ink spilled about the need for 30-plus brands, and I think that question probably comes up just because of the subtlety of differences in pricing and positioning and maybe the argument that every brand adds some degree of marginal cost.

I mean, if we had not merged with Starwood, would we be trying to build 30 brands from scratch? I think the answer is probably not. At the same time, having done this deal, the 30 brands all exist, they all have substantial capital that has been invested in them particularly by the hotel owners who have made deliberate bets about which flag they put on their hotels. And we don't have the power to nor the desire to try and convince them that those bets have not been good bets. I think the other thing that's really important to recognize here if we -- the biggest expense from a brand perspective in theory is about marketing brands. And obviously, that's the most expensive when each brand has to be marketed on its own. And in that context, you would want as much definition as you could have between brands, and it would still be expensive to go out and market each one alone. I think in many respects, that's no longer our model if it ever was. I think the principal model today is we go to market through our loyalty platform through our dotcom site, through our app. And those things allow us to essentially market a portfolio and offer, through that portfolio, an incredible range of choice to our customers, which drives actually conversion from looking to booking that much higher and makes the economics of each brand better, not weaker. And so you put all that together and I think that's why we conclude that we're going to keep these brands and we're going to continue to grow them. I don't really think that there are material incremental costs to having a brand, given that, that's the business model that we have."

But we also see and look at the third quarter EPS growth results and Legacy-Marriott because that's the only sort of apples-to-apples comparison we can do, but you're in a high teens percentage growth year-over-year. And we think the model's working extraordinarily well. We think the strength of the Starwood brands and the Starwood loyalty program have continued to impress us.

I think the other thing I would point out is that earlier when we were looking, we had less comfort about knowing the details around their cash globally. And as a result of doing the entity restructuring that I described earlier, we are comfortable that we are going to be able to use all of the debt -- all the cash balances that we don't need to run our business to repay debt and use for general corporate purposes over the near term.

I think the 3 biggest ones, as we described before, the 3 biggest changes to the 40 basis point improvement was, as we described, just more cash overall being able to feel comfortable about our access to that cash; the level of the EBITDAR, which is refined for both their higher owned, leased performance and frankly, the combination of the 2 companies' combined performance on the latest trailing 12-month; and then the third, that you were able to look at the actual amounts of cash that you have on hand."

And those loyalty programs, managed well, should allow us to drive that much more of our business directly from our most loyal members, which is the cheapest business for us to book because it comes and books to us directly. And to -- you don't do that just by being nice and good-looking. You've got to do that by delivering real value to those customers because they're not going to be loyal to us unless it's in their interest to be loyal. And so we're working through those things. They include significant workaround systems and the like that we use to have our relationship with them but also how do we continue to make sure we're delivering value to them. And so free WiFi and member rates and mobile check-in and keyless entry and points, these are already things which are really available to our loyalty members but not to other customers.

Think about particularly markets in which select-serve tells are much more prominent than full-service hotels. Starwood had obviously some Four Points, a few Alofts and precious few Elements but you compare the number of those 3 brands that Starwood had across the United States with what Marriott had in Courtyard and SpringHill Suites and Residence Inn and Fairfield and the like, and there are thousands more places for those customers to stay with us now broadly defined as the new Marriott. And as a consequence, we should drive more share. And with that greater distribution, the loyalty program itself becomes more powerful. Obviously, one of the things that customers look for is what are the benefits I get in terms of suite upgrades or bonus points or access to lounges or other things? But also can I stay within that network regularly when I travel so that I can earn the kind of status and earn the number of points that I need in order to really get the free vacations or to get the other things that I want to get with those points?

And that was actually a powerful communication to the SPG members that, ""Oh actually, Marriott is paying attention to what Starwood has provided to us for some period of time."" And that's a reassuring sign. But we'll look at suite upgrades and redemption rules and all these other aspects over the course of the next few years and try and do right by our customers and obviously do right by the program."

So on the North American limited-service side of things, the performance for both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood and actually the industry from what we've seen from STR was a little weaker than expected yet we continue to hear that the corporate leisure customer is strong.

But if you look at the portfolio as a whole, the full-service hotels get disproportionate benefit from group business, and group business is stronger than corporate transient, particularly today. The managed select-service portfolio also skews, not as much as the full-service hotels but skews a little bit more towards group than the franchise select-service portfolio does. And so that's helpful too. And I think the third thing is around geographic distribution. So when you look at select-service, when you look at the franchise portfolio, when you look at a lot of industry data, select-service hotels can skew more towards oil and gas markets. Think about markets that nobody had never heard of before a couple of years ago like Williston, North Dakota and environs where you got all this oil work that's happening out there, select-service hotels exploded onto the scene. There's not a single full-service hotel in the whole area basically and maybe a little less dramatic in markets like Houston. But you look across Texas, you look across many of these markets and you'll see that those hotels are competing in, on average, tougher markets again without the benefit of group and that would be the bulk of the explanation."

So I think you will find, in general, year-over-year, you'll find some really strong growth across both portfolios and perhaps, in some respects, a better measure of how they're doing. At the same time, clearly when we look at it, we are trying to make sure that we are taking into consideration exactly what is going on with either delayed deals or deals that are falling off. And so from that standpoint, we kind of trued it up, but I think you'll find it's such a small difference when you look at kind of how the 2 companies put their pipelines together that it's not anything particularly meaningful. We are excited about the kind of the level of interest. We've done a bunch of deals even since we've closed on the transaction and look forward to continuing to watch it grow."

At this point, we're really not in a position to kind of get super detailed. I think the easiest way to describe it is what we talked about from an EBITDA perspective, which is the $180 million to $190 million of EBITDA associated with Starwood's owned hotels. We also did talk about the fact that our depreciation and amortization estimates associated with the purchase of Starwood have declined relative to the earlier description. And part of that, I'd say roughly half of that, was associated with moving several of those hotels into the assets held for sale category, which is again going to impact D&A but is not going to impact the owned hotels net. So specific numbers, we'll be able to talk more about in February. I think for now, the EBITDA is probably the easier way to think about it. Obviously, when we sell these hotels, we'll end up with a great stream of management fees in managing the hotels. So it's one thing to keep in mind is that although there is EBITDA that goes to the buyer of these assets, we're going to continue to have a great stream of earnings from them."

Obviously, the U.S. assets are easiest to predict but we've got some owned assets in other markets around the world. On average though, you would expect that the sales prices we received should be at least at the EBITDA level, if not higher, that the company is trading at. And so the transaction should be accretive from an EBITDA perspective. And when you look at it from an earnings perspective after depreciation associated with owned hotels, they should be significantly accretive from an earnings perspective. Now again, that's on average. We're not saying necessarily that in a higher cap rate market where the risk profile is actually quite different that we will necessarily always get proceeds which are higher than our EBITDA multiple. But I think generally across the average, we should see that this is accretive to the P&L and the balance sheet of the company."

Given your comments about certain delays today, and I think you also mentioned it anecdotally the last quarter, is that rooms growth disproportionately weighted to the second half of the year?

So we do have in this headquarters building someplace, I'm sure, a detailed schedule of when we think hotels are going to open. But we're not rolling that out necessarily in a way that's very digestible by quarter. Having said that, I would think to the earlier question about when supply growth will peak. I suspect we are continuing to see, on average, that we're opening more next year than this year, and we're probably opening more in '18 than in '17, which would suggest that there will be some back-end skewing to next year. I don't think it will be profound though. Obviously, we've opened a lot of hotels this year. We've missed a little bit this year and those are slipping into '17 but there'll be in early '17. And so I think the year as a whole should be fairly robust in terms of its openings. But again, I'd suspect fourth quarter will have more than the first quarter did simply because we continue to ramp. On fee growth, obviously, the 2 biggest inputs to the year-over-year fee growth is unit growth and RevPAR. And with 6% unit growth and 0% to 2% RevPAR growth, both can drive an increase in the top line. Although it's obvious that the rooms growth will drive more top line growth than the RevPAR growth unless we're wildly conservative in that 0% to 2% number. The next piece of that is what happens with incentive fees. And I think there, you end up in a 0% to 2% market with the real need to say, ""Okay, what's happening in the high incentive fee markets for the company like New York, like Washington, like London."" And other markets around the world. And until we do the budgets, that's going to be hard to give you much guidance.
