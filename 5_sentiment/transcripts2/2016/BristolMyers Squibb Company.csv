Good morning, everyone. Well, 2015 was a pivotal, very important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. We began a new chapter of growth and laid a strong foundation for our future. This was through across the topline. Commercially, we had $16.",882,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Well, 2015 was a pivotal, very important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. We began a new chapter of growth and laid a strong foundation for our future. This was through across the topline. 
Commercially, we had $16.5 billion in sales, 4% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong given the loss of exclusivity for ABILIFY early in the year. Regarding R&D, it was an extraordinary year, with 112 product approvals, including 23 in major markets and 11 by the FDA alone. 
In addition, we also had 3 Opdivos study for overall survival. 
Let me share just a few of our highlights and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands. 
We are very encouraged by the global performance of Eliquis and I believe that we are well on our way to becoming the #1 globally. 
Global sales for 2015 were $1.8 billion, which represents more of a doubling versus prior year. 
Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance in 2015, notably in Japan, in certain European countries, and most recently, in the U.S., where we saw good performance in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we had $1.6 billion in global sales. Obviously, we all know this is a very competitive and highly dynamic market. We do you expect new competition to have an impact on our business as we are already seeing in Japan. 
Orencia also had a good year, with almost $1.9 billion in sales, 14% increase over '14. 
Regarding immuno-oncology, it was nothing less than an incredible year. We exceeded expectations, thanks to important clinical results, earlier-than-expected launches and an unprecedented uptake in new patient share across multiple tumor types, validating our development strategy, our belief in the importance of overall survival and our strong commercial capabilities. 
Commercially, Opdivo performance was very strong, merely $1 billion in global sales. 
In lung cancer in the U.S, we have approximately 60% of new patient share in non-squamous and around 70% in squamous. 
In melanoma, we are pleased to have a broad approach to this market with indications ranging from [indiscernible] setting with Yervoy to the metastatic setting with Opdivo. 
The adoption of our combination therapy, the first of its kind, has been strong, and we have approximately 20% market share. 
And in renal cancer, I am pleased to report that the updated similar to what we're seeing in lung with new shares over 50%. 
With respect to R&D, 2015 was an exceptional year. And in fact, we are already off to a very strong start in 2016. 
This morning, we announced the early stop of our CheckMate -141 study in patients with head and neck cancer, our feed early study stop with Opdivo. We look forward to discussing the data with regulatory authorities. 
Last year, 3 of our key trials with Opdivo were stopped early because of a survival advantage versus the previous standard of care. And we moved quickly and effectively with regulators, receiving 7 approvals from the FDA across 3 tumor types. Opdivo is now approved in 46 countries. 
We accomplished much in lung. In the U.S., Opdivo is the only PD-1 indicated for all second line patients across all histologies and importantly, regardless of PD-1 status.  In the EU, we have received approvals for squamous and are awaiting regulatory review for non-squamous. And in Japan, Opdivo was approved with a broad label in December. 
In renal cancer, Opdivo's approval came in the second half of the year, only one week after our submission was validated by the FDA, which demonstrates the importance of the data in an area where the medical need for patients is very high. All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments in immuno-oncology, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications. 
Going forward, we remind fully committed to further strengthen and our position. This year, we should see data from Opdivo trials in 4 additional tumors and in first line lung cancer and start to see some data from some of our early assets. 
Finally, we expect 3 additional I-O assets to enter clinical trials, bringing the total to 8 clinical assets beyond Yervoy, Opdivo and Empliciti. 
I'm confident we're making all of the right investments. From a commercial perspective and from an R&D perspective to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position. 
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie to provide our 2015 financials and '16 outlook, let me say, that I am very confident and optimistic about our future year at Bristol-Myers Squibb. As we have entered a period of expected growth. Driven by the unprecedented success in '15, we are in a position of strength with significant growth opportunities in I-O where we have advanced our leadership position in Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong, and we are advancing a diverse, innovative and promising pipelines by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need. 
And with that, I'll turn over -- I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. I will start with some comments regarding the quarter and then move on to our 2016 guidance. As Giovanni mentioned, we have a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across our key brand. Total reven",1165,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will start with some comments regarding the quarter and then move on to our 2016 guidance. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we have a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across our key brand. Total revenues were $4.3 billion, up 1% over last year. 
With the continued strengthening of the dollar against most currencies, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of 5% in the quarter and approximately $0.08 fall in EPS. 
Sales for Eliquis were $602 million, more than double from fourth quarter last year. Eliquis is now the #1 NOAC in brand patient share in cardiology across 12 markets around the world, and we continue to see strong demand trends from key markets such as the U.S, Germany and Japan. 
Sales for our hepatitis C portfolio were $458 million, with most of its sales coming from Daklinza. U.S. sales were $212 million,and we're seeing strong demand since the launch in Q3. Sales in Europe were $121 million, with strong performance in Germany, France and Italy. 
In Japan, we had sales of $80 million, which is down significantly from Q3 sales of $175 million as recent trends reflect pressure from new regimens that have entered the market. 
Opdivo uptake continues to be very strong, with sales of $475 million for the quarter. As Giovanni mentioned, we are seeing rapid adoption in the U.S. with Q4 sales of $410 million. 
About 2/3 of Opdivo sales are within lung cancer, both squamous and non-squamous. We are also seeing an increase in melanoma with approval and launch of the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen. Our I-O portfolio now has the leading new patient share in first line melanoma. 
Opdivo has now been approved in 46 countries the European launch for both first and second line metastatic melanoma and squamous non-small cell lung cancer is going well in the countries where pricing has been secured, notably Germany where we're seeing rapid uptake in both lung and melanoma. 
Sales for Yervoy were $256 million, down 28% from last year. There are 2 dynamics at play. With the U.S. approval and launch of the regimen in the adjuvant indication, we are seeing signs of stabilization there. Outside the U.S., the launch of Opdivo and KEYTRUDA are having on impact on Yervoy where sales are down 40%. 
We launched Empliciti in the U.S. in December. We become promotional activities with just a couple of days and are in good position with ACTA. While it's early, we are seeing the high level of interest and recent trends are encouraging. 
We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business. Sales of Ray and SUSTIVA down 14% and 23%, respectively. 
Recall that we transferred our rights to Erbitux on October 1 and therefore we no longer record revenues. In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux in both the U.S. and Japan were approximately $60 million and were recorded in other income. 
Now I'll comment on a few line items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 78% in the quarter. Our gross margin varies, primarily due to product mix and benefited from the divestiture of Erbitux and strong Opdivo and hep C sales. 
As you recall, we increased investments to support important growth opportunities in our portfolio, both commercially and in R&D. Marketing selling and administrative expenses, which now includes ANT increased about 10% in the quarter due to the increase investments in key brands, primarily Opdivo. R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments behind I-O and Empliciti, which includes clinical trials and expanding our medical organizations globally. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.1%, which reflects the full year of the R&D tax credit, which is permanently extended in December. 
2015 was a very good year across the board that we are pleased that it marks a year of both top and bottom line growth. We expect this momentum to continue in 2016 with revenues expected to grow about 5% and strong double-digit EPS growth. 
As you saw in our release, we are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $2.30 to $2.40 range. This range assumes current exchange rates. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we expect strong performance in Opdivo given the strong execution in the U.S. and launches in more countries as we secure additional approvals with associated pricing and reimbursement. 
Eliquis is also an important growth drive and we're seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue. 
Our hep C portfolio will continue to be a meaningful contributor to revenues, though new regimens are already having an impact in Japan. We expect a similar situation in the U.S. later this year. 
As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind, which will have an impact in our 2016 revenues. 
As I mentioned, we are seeing stabilization of our Yervoy business in the U.S., but ex- U.S., we are seeing pressure particularly in the EU, and that will expand as PD-1 launched globally. 
Recall that the regimen and adjuvant indication are not yet approved outside the U.S. which accounts for approximately 50% of Yervoy sales, so we do expect to continue to see the impact of PD-1 there. 
The HIV franchise remains under competitive pressure. 
Our mature products are naturally decline in business. In addition, the expiration of certain relationships with third-party supply agreements and the divestitures of exemplary of some international products last year further impacted this category. 
As previously mentioned, we no longer record revenues for Erbitux. We will record royalties at Erbitux sales and other income. 
As you all know, the U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all currencies from 2015 average rates. Based on current FX rates, this is expected to negatively impact our 2016 revenues by approximately 2% and $0.10 to $0.12 on earnings per share, which is factored into our guidance. 
To summarize, our 2016 sales outlook, we are very pleased that our key brands that are important to our future growth are performing very well. Our underlying revenue growth, excluding the impact of Erbitux, ABILIFY exclusivity FX is in the low teens. 
Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix. For 2016, the loss of rights to ABILIFY and the structure of our copromotion agreement for Eliquis will put downward pressure on gross margin, partially offsetting that will be the growth of sales of new product such as Opdivo and the divestiture of Erbitux. 
Additionally, FX favorability that we saw on international cost of goods in 2015 is not expected to incur in 2016. 
Our operating expense projections for 2016 reflect investments that we began in the second half of last year that are continuing, particularly in R&D, which includes additional clinical trial investments, increased medical resources and Phase IV studies. We will, however, continue to be prudent with commercial resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. 
As a Giovanni described, 2015 was an exceptional year, which provides great momentum as we enter 2016. 
Now we'd be happy to address your questions."

I would add couple of things to Giovanni's comments, specifically in the lung area, we have been very pleased as you know we see rapid uptake in squamous after availability of the [indiscernible] data and subsequent approval, and we've seen similar uptake now in non-squamous where we are about 60% new patient share in second line. That profile is a very competitive profile for Opdivo. We have 2 strong indications that overall survival benefit and continued to see very strong receptive from oncologists because of the lack of a requirement to test for PD-L1 status in lung. Now with the release of other data from our competitors, namely the O1 O study, we continue to feel that, that competitiveness in second line continue. Given the fact that we've been able to establish superiority in squamous and and non-squamous separately in all populations and have a resulting indication for both histologies that reflect that, we feel really good. We haven't really seen deterioration in our new to patients share with the advent of the O1 O data set. I think you also asked about head and neck. We see the opportunity in head and neck is really exciting. Obviously, when we see the actual full data set, we'll know more about what to expect. But what I would say is this is a high unmet medical need area and it's one where Opdivo in second line could represent significant opportunity. That being said, it is a smaller tumor type, it's between -- and second line is between 5,000 and 10,000 untreatable patients in the U.S., a little higher than that in Europe."

We would expect to see Yervoy continue to feel the pressure of the advent of first line new patient share of Opdivo and KEYTRUDA across Europe. So expect for Yervoy to have some pressure going forward ex U.S. When it comes to renal cell carcinoma, the most recent approval for Opdivo, we're very happy and are seeing rapid uptake like we saw in melanoma and in lung, where we see roughly a 50% new patient share and these percentages move around there from very small data sets, we use them as directional, and we use them to estimate how to rapidly behavior is changing in the market. Ex U.S., we're very happy with reimbursement evolution, and we are seeing reimbursement authorities across Europe move quickly with us to find appropriate reimbursement for patients across Europe, and we feel very good with the broad label that we have in Europe that includes both first line melanoma for Opdivo and squamous non-small land cell lung cancer we feel very good about our ability to negotiate good access for European patients."

I would say net-net, a lot of our mix of that the bigger impact as I mentioned in my comments is related to FX on international cost of goods sold. If you recall the end of 2014, FX rate started deteriorating and the benefit that we got is that flow through our international cost of goods in 2015 doesn't repeat again given the rates are -- don't have that larger economy year-over-year.

So as far as the -- the exploracy programs in novel combinations, we are getting the diagnosed of both in lung therapy and combination it's possible we percent data later in 2016 and I think depending on what we see, we could move into larger studies by year's end or early 2017.

One thing to keep in mind is what we are seeing in the lung market is there is a slow moving but growing evolution of testing, particularly in first line, so testing in second line is a difficult proposition, as you know, because of the ability to read buyouts of assessed issue, but we are seeing first line testing in the range of about 60%.

First, we continue to be very active in immuno-oncology. I know you were joking when you said it's on autopilot, but in reality, we really feel we are at the very beginning of an extraordinary story in immuno-oncology. And we continue to be very focused not only on delivering the value of the portfolio to pipeline we have, but also continuing to strengthen that. And going back to what I said a few minutes ago, the agreements we reached in 2015 really has strengthened immuno-oncology, particularly in the tumor microenvironment. Second, we are focused on diversifying beyond immuno-oncology. We have signed some important agreements last year that have strengthened our pipeline in cardiovascular medicines where we now combining internal and external we have really attractive approach to heart failure. We are building a very differentiated early pipeline in fibrosis, continuing to advance interesting assets in Immunoscience and as you know, we have 2 genetically defined disease products in between as well.

We began a new chapter of growth and laid a strong foundation for our future. This was true across the top line. 
Commercially, we had $16.5 billion in sales, 4% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong given the loss of exclusivity for ABILIFY early in the year. Regarding R&D, it was an extraordinary year, with 112 product approvals, including 23 in major markets and 11 by the FDA alone. 
In addition, we also had 3 Opdivo study stops for overall survival. 
Let me share just a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands. We are very encouraged by the global performance of Eliquis, and I believe that we are well on our way to becoming the #1 NOAC globally. Global sales for 2015 were $1.8 billion, which represents more than doubling versus prior year. 
Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance in 2015, notably in Japan, in certain European countries and, most recently, in the U.S., where we saw good performance in the fourth quarter. Overall, we had $1.6 billion in global sales. Obviously, we all know this is a very competitive and highly dynamic market. We do expect new competition to have an impact on our business, as we are already seeing in Japan. Orencia also had a good year, with almost $1.9 billion in sales, 14% increase over '14. 
Regarding immuno-oncology, it was nothing less than an incredible year. We exceeded expectations, thanks to important clinical results, earlier-than-expected launches and an unprecedented uptake in new patient share across multiple tumor types, validating our development strategy, our belief in the importance of overall survival and our strong commercial capabilities. Commercially, Opdivo performance was very strong, nearly $1 billion in global sales. 
In lung cancer, in the U.S., we have approximately 60% of new patient share in non-squamous and around 70% in squamous. In melanoma, we are pleased to have a broad approach to this market, with indications ranging from the adjuvant setting with Yervoy to the metastatic setting with Opdivo. The adoption of our combination therapy, the first of its kind, has been strong, and we have approximately 20% market share. And in renal cancer, I am pleased to report that the uptake is similar to what we've seen in lung, with new patient shares over 50%. 
With respect to R&D, 2015 was an exceptional year, and in fact, we are already off to a very strong start in 2016. This morning, we announced the early stop of our CheckMate -141 study in patients with head and neck cancer, our fifth early study stop with Opdivo. We look forward to discussing the data with regulatory authorities. Last year, 3 of our key trials with Opdivo were stopped early because of a survival advantage versus the previous standard of care, and we moved quickly and effectively with regulators, receiving 7 approvals from the FDA across 3 tumor types. Opdivo is now approved in 46 countries. 
We accomplished much in lung. In the U.S., Opdivo is the only PD-1 indicated for all second-line patients across all histologies and, importantly, regardless of PD-1 status. In the EU, we have received approvals for squamous and are awaiting regulatory review for non-squamous. And in Japan, Opdivo was approved with a broad label in December. In renal cancer, Opdivo's approval came in the second half of the year, only 1 week after our submission was validated by the FDA, which demonstrates the importance of the data in an area where the medical need for patients is very high. 
All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments in immuno-oncology, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications. Going forward, we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. This year, we should see data from Opdivo trials in 4 additional tumors and in first-line lung cancer and start to see some data from some of our early assets. 
Finally, we expect 3 additional I-O assets to enter clinical trials, bringing the total to 8 clinical assets beyond Yervoy, Opdivo and Empliciti. I'm confident we're making all of the right investments, from a commercial perspective and from an R&D perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position. 
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie to provide our 2015 financials and '16 outlook, let me say that I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb, as we have entered a period of expected growth. Driven by the unprecedented success in '15, we are in a position of strength with significant growth opportunities in I-O, where we have advanced our leadership position in Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong, and we are advancing a diverse, innovative and promising pipeline by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need. 
And with that, I'll turn over -- I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. I will start with some comments regarding the quarter and then move on to our 2016 guidance. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across our key brands. Total reven",1172,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will start with some comments regarding the quarter and then move on to our 2016 guidance. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across our key brands. Total revenues were $4.3 billion, up 1% over last year. With the continued strengthening of the dollar against most currencies, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of 5% in the quarter and approximately $0.08 fall in EPS. 
Sales for Eliquis were $602 million, more than double from fourth quarter last year. Eliquis is now the #1 NOAC in new-to-brand patient share in cardiology across 12 markets around the world, and we continue to see strong demand trends from key markets such as the U.S, Germany and Japan. 
Sales for our hepatitis C portfolio were $458 million, with most of its sales coming from Daklinza. U.S. sales were $212 million,and we are seeing strong demand since the launch in Q3. Sales in Europe were $121 million, with strong performance in Germany, France and Italy. In Japan, we had sales of $80 million, which is down significantly from Q3 sales of $175 million as recent trends reflect the pressure from new regimens that have entered the market. 
Opdivo uptake continues to be very strong, with sales of $475 million for the quarter. As Giovanni mentioned, we are seeing rapid adoption in the U.S, with Q4 sales of $410 million. About 2/3 of Opdivo sales are within lung cancer, both squamous and non-squamous. We are also seeing an increase in melanoma with the approval and launch of the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen. Our I-O portfolio now has the leading new patient share in first-line melanoma.  Opdivo has now been approved in 46 countries. The European launch for both first and second-line metastatic melanoma and squamous non-small cell lung cancer is going well in the countries where pricing has been secured, notably Germany, where we are seeing rapid uptake in both lung and melanoma. 
Sales for Yervoy were $256 million, down 28% from last year. There are 2 dynamics at play. With the U.S. approval and launch of the regimen in the adjuvant indication, we are seeing signs of stabilization there. Outside the U.S., the launch of Opdivo and KEYTRUDA are having an impact on Yervoy, where sales were down 40%. 
We launched Empliciti in the U.S. in December. We began promotional activities with just a couple of days and are in good position with access. While it's early, we are seeing a high level of interest, and recent trends are encouraging. 
We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business. Sales of REYATAZ and SUSTIVA down 14% and 23%, respectively. Recall that we transferred our rights to Erbitux on October 1, and therefore, we no longer record revenues. In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux in both the U.S. and Japan were approximately $60 million and were recorded in other income. 
Now I'll comment on a few line items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 78% during the quarter. Our gross margin varies primarily due to product mix and benefited from the divestiture of Erbitux and strong Opdivo and hep C sales. As you recall, we increased investments to support important growth opportunities in our portfolio, both commercially and in R&D. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, which now includes A&P, increased about 10% in the quarter due to the increased investments in key brands, primarily Opdivo. R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments behind I-O and Empliciti, which includes clinical trials and expanding our medical organizations globally. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.1%, which reflects a full year of the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended in December. 
2015 was a very good year across the board, and we are pleased that it marks a year of both top and bottom line growth. We expect this momentum to continue in 2016, with revenues expected to grow about 5% and strong double-digit EPS growth. As you saw in our release, we are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $2.30 to $2.40 range. This range assumes current exchange rates. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we expect strong performance in Opdivo given the strong execution in the U.S. and launches in more countries as we secure additional approvals with associated pricing and reimbursement. Eliquis is also an important growth driver, and we are seeing strong exit trends that we will -- we believe will continue. Our hep C portfolio will continue to be a meaningful contributor to revenues, though new regimens are already having an impact in Japan, and we expect a similar situation in the U.S. later this year. 
As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind which will have an impact on our 2016 revenues. As I mentioned, we are seeing stabilization of our Yervoy business in the U.S., but ex-U.S., we are seeing pressure, particularly in the EU, and that will expand as PD-1s launch globally.  Recall that the regimen in adjuvant indication are not yet approved outside the U.S., which accounts for approximately 50% of Yervoy sales, so we do expect to continue to see the impact of PD-1s there. The HIV franchise remains under competitive pressure. 
Our mature products are a naturally declining business. In addition, the expiration of certain relationships with third-party supply agreements and the divestitures of IXEMPRA and some international products last year further impacted this category. As previously mentioned, we no longer record revenues for Erbitux. We will record royalties on Erbitux sales in other income. 
As you all know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2015 average rates. Based on current FX rates, this is expected to negatively impact our 2016 revenues by approximately 2% and $0.10 to $0.12 on earnings per share, which is factored into our guidance. 
To summarize our 2016 sales outlook, we are very pleased that our key brands that are important to our future growth are performing very well. Our underlying revenue growth, excluding the impact of Erbitux, ABILIFY exclusivity and FX, is in the low teens. Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix. For 2016, the loss of rights to ABILIFY and the structure of our co-promotion agreement for Eliquis will put downward pressure on gross margin. Partially offsetting that will be the growth in sales of new products such as Opdivo and the divestiture of Erbitux. Additionally, FX favorability that we saw on international cost of goods in 2015 is not expected to occur in 2016. 
Our operating expense projections for 2016 reflect investments that we began in the second half of last year that are continuing, particularly in R&D, which includes additional clinical trial investments, increased medical resources and Phase IV studies. We will, however, continue to be prudent with commercial resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. As Giovanni described, 2015 was an exceptional year, which provides great momentum as we enter 2016. 
Now we'd be happy to address your questions."

Now with the release of other data from our competitors, namely the 010 study, we continue to feel that, that competitiveness in second line continue. Given the fact that we've been able to establish superiority in squamous and non-squamous separately in all-comer populations and have a resulting indication for both histologies that reflects that, we feel really good. We haven't really seen a deterioration in our new to patient share (sic) [new-to-brand patient share] with the advent of the 010 dataset. I think you also asked about head and neck. We see the opportunity in head and neck as really exciting. Obviously, when we see the actual full dataset, we'll know more about what to expect. But what I would say is this is a high unmet medical need area, and it's one where Opdivo in second line could represent a significant opportunity. That being said, it is a smaller tumor type. It's between -- in second line, it's between 5,000 and 10,000 treatable patients in the U.S., a little higher than that in Europe."

The 2 most recent approvals where there is more dynamic growth in the fourth quarter really were the uptake of the regimen in melanoma and renal, and we are very encouraged by both trends. Those trends will continue into 2016. We also see that in '16, we will begin to see uptake in other European countries. The only country where we really have an uptake to date is Germany, and those curves are similar to the U.S. But we are making progress.

It's early days and we have a newly expanded label to include all patients regardless of BRAF status, and so we hope that, that will continue to evolve in the U.S. Now I'll go back to comments that Charlie made. ex-U.S. for Yervoy specifically, where we don't have a regimen indication nor do we have an adjuvant indication, we would expect to see Yervoy continue to feel the pressure of the advent of first-line new patient share of Opdivo and KEYTRUDA across Europe. So expect Yervoy to have some pressure going forward ex-U.S. When it comes to renal cell carcinoma, the most recent approval for Opdivo, we're very happy and are seeing rapid uptake like we saw in melanoma and in lung, where we see roughly a 50% new patient share. Now these percentages move around there from very small datasets. We use them as directional, and we use them to estimate how rapidly behavior is changing in the market. ex-U.S., we're very happy with reimbursement evolution, and we are seeing reimbursement authorities across Europe move quickly with us to find appropriate reimbursement for patients across Europe. And we feel very good with the broad label that we have in Europe that includes both first-line melanoma for Opdivo and squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

I am assuming that you are just being conservative since this is the beginning of the year, and it probably proves -- or pays to be conservative at this early part of the year. But help me to understand -- well, I understand that Eliquis will get bigger and that puts pressure on your gross margin. The other line items of your business are growing. And when I think about the contribution of Opdivo in the growth, do you expect growth of Opdivo in 2016 relative to the expected growth of Eliquis? I would think that mix should be in your favor. You also mentioned that Erbitux would be in your favor, too. So if you can just explain why 75%, 76% versus ending the year at 77%. And then if you could also just address -- with respect to guidance, the guidance doesn't seem to imply much in the way of margin expansion. You had made some comments about that a couple of quarters ago, but where are we in terms of when we should expect to see meaningful margin expansion to play out?"

You're right, Opdivo is going to be a big year in 2016. Eliquis, though, does put a drag on that. I would say net-net, a lot of our mix almost nets off, but the bigger impact, as I mentioned in my comments, is related to FX on international cost of goods sold. If you recall, at the end of 2014, FX rates started deteriorating, and the benefit that we got is that flowed through our international cost of goods in 2015. It doesn't repeat again given rates are -- don't have that larger dichotomy year-over-year. So that's almost 2% impact and also includes some hedging gain that flowed through cost of goods sold, again, in 2015. In regard to operating margin, the way we're defining and most of all of you analysts define it is our operating income over sales. So that's how we're looking at it, and that's how we can talk about it going forward. We've addressed this and said that we expect leverage mostly beginning in 2017. As I look at how we finished 2015 at about 23.4%, we don't expect any decline in 2016. It should be flat or slightly above that as we look at 2016."

And as they become better established and we're interested in that data, we are very much open to making moves in that area.

And I guess of special importance would be the first-line lung given the fact that Merck results might be doing a similar time frame. And then the second question on timing has to do with your later-generation products. So in October in your earnings call, you talked about having data on things like LAG and KIR and CD137 late '15, early '16.

So as far as the -- the exploratory programs in novel combinations, we are getting data in-house now both in monotherapy and combination. It's possible we'll present data later in 2016, and I think depending on what we see, we could move into larger studies by year's end or early 2017.

One thing to keep in mind is what we are seeing in the lung market is there is a slow moving but growing evolution of testing, particularly in first line. So testing in second line is a difficult proposition, as you know, because of ability to rebiopsy your assessed tissue. But we are seeing first-line testing in the range of about 60%.

And then I'd love to ask Giovanni about capital allocation. I certainly felt like, please correct me if I'm wrong, that you've signaled that -- diversifying the company, that I-O will kind of -- is on autopilot and the company is very focused on it. But one of your goals as a relatively new CEO was to make sure the company was well diversified. And you've mentioned several therapeutic areas that you're interested in. You've done some smaller deals, but is this still a big focus for you? And would -- how's your appetite for perhaps medium-sized deals around the $10 billion mark that other companies have cited?"

So first of all, business development remains a top priority for us. I must say that, while many of our deals last year where smaller deals on early assets, they all are extremely interesting from a scientific perspective. And actually, 2015 was a year of unprecedented activity for us from a business development perspective. First, we continue to be very active in immuno-oncology. I know you were joking when you said it's on autopilot, but in reality, we really feel we are at the very beginning of an extraordinary story in immuno-oncology. And we continue to be very focused not only on delivering the value of the portfolio and the pipeline we have but also continuing to strengthen that. And going back to what I said a few minutes ago, the agreements we reached in 2015 really has -- have strengthened immuno-oncology, particularly in the tumor microenvironment. Second, we are focused on diversifying beyond immuno-oncology. We have signed some important agreements last year that have strengthened our pipeline in cardiovascular medicines, where we're now combining internal and external. We have a really attractive approach to heart failure. We are building a very differentiated early pipeline in fibrosis, continuing to advance interesting assets in Immunoscience. And as you know, we have 2 genetically defined disease products in the clinic as well. So that, coupled with the strengthening performance of Eliquis, provides a good platform for growth outside of oncology as well. And with respect to your question regarding the size of the deals, as we've said in the past, we are agnostic. We are really interested in deals that make sense strategically in terms of the therapeutic area fit that are very strong in terms of the scientific promise and obviously makes sense financially."

I'll just -- I'll go through Eliquis very quickly, but we are seeing strength in Eliquis across all major markets. Performance in Japan, U.S. and across Europe has been very strong. As was mentioned, we now lead in new-to-brand prescriptions in cardiology, which we see as a leading indicator for the entire market across 12 markets. And we're seeing really, really strong demand in all of the major markets in our stroke prevention, atrial fibrillation indication, and we have more recently launched the VTE treatment indication across Europe and in Japan. So we'll see hopefully some continued acceleration of that. You alluded to the donut hole effect in Q3. We did see somewhat less coverage gap impact in Q4 in the U.S., but we did have, nonetheless, some of that in Q3. So we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see strong evolution in Eliquis. And along with our Pfizer partners, we feel really good about being able to drive Eliquis to become the #1 NOAC, as Giovanni mentioned earlier in the call. With respect to your question on Opdivo and DOT, duration of therapy, in lung, really, this is a very difficult number to get at so early after launch. It seems like longer, but we've only really been in the market in lung since March of last year. And you really need 24 months to have a 12-month look-back to get to an accurate duration of therapy, so it's still difficult to elucidate that. So we don't have a good number for you there. And then you also asked about are we seeing physicians persist when there's evident progression. I wouldn't have a good answer for you there, but we are seeing -- in the case of patients who are high expressers and the status is known, I would think that persistence there would be more likely than in low expressers."

We began a new chapter of growth and laid a strong foundation for our future. This was true across the top line. 
Commercially, we had $16.5 billion in sales, 4% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong given the loss of exclusivity for ABILIFY early in the year. Regarding R&D, it was an extraordinary year, with 112 product approvals, including 23 in major markets and 11 by the FDA alone. 
In addition, we also had 3 Opdivo study stops for overall survival. 
Let me share just a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands. We are very encouraged by the global performance of Eliquis, and I believe that we are well on our way to becoming the #1 NOAC globally. Global sales for 2015 were $1.8 billion, which represents more than [ph] a doubling versus prior year. 
Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance in 2015, notably in Japan, in certain European countries and, most recently, in the U.S., where we saw good performance in the fourth quarter. Overall, we had $1.6 billion in global sales. Obviously, we all know this is a very competitive and highly dynamic market. We do expect new competition to have an impact on our business, as we are already seeing in Japan. Orencia also had a good year, with almost $1.9 billion in sales, 14% increase over '14. 
Regarding immuno-oncology, it was nothing less than an incredible year. We exceeded expectations, thanks to important clinical results, earlier-than-expected launches and an unprecedented uptake in new patient share across multiple tumor types, validating our development strategy, our belief in the importance of overall survival and our strong commercial capabilities. Commercially, Opdivo performance was very strong, nearly $1 billion in global sales. 
In lung cancer, in the U.S., we have approximately 60% of new patient share in non-squamous and around 70% in squamous. In melanoma, we are pleased to have a broad approach to this market with indications ranging from the adjuvant setting with Yervoy to the metastatic setting with Opdivo. The adoption of our combination therapy, the first of its kind, has been strong, and we have approximately 20% market share. And in renal cancer, I am pleased to report that the uptake is similar to what we've seen in lung, with new patient shares over 50%. 
With respect to R&D, 2015 was an exceptional year, and in fact, we are already off to a very strong start in 2016. This morning, we announced the early stop of our CheckMate -141 study in patients with head and neck cancer, our fifth early study stop with Opdivo. We look forward to discussing the data with the regulatory authorities. Last year, 3 of our key trials with Opdivo were stopped early because of a survival advantage versus the previous standard of care, and we moved quickly and effectively with regulators, receiving 7 approvals from the FDA across 3 tumor types. Opdivo is now approved in 46 countries. 
We accomplished much in lung. In the U.S., Opdivo is the only PD-1 indicated for all second-line patients across all histologies and, importantly, regardless of PD-1 status. In the EU, we have received approvals for squamous and are awaiting regulatory review for non-squamous. And in Japan, Opdivo was approved with a broad label in December. In renal cancer, Opdivo's approval came in the second half of the year, only 1 week after our submission was validated by the FDA, which demonstrates the importance of the data in an area where the medical need for patients is very high. 
All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments in immuno-oncology, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications. Going forward, we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. This year, we should see data from Opdivo trials in 4 additional tumors and in first-line lung cancer and start to see some data from some of our earlier assets. 
Finally, we expect 3 additional I-O assets to enter clinical trials, bringing the total to 8 clinical assets beyond Yervoy, Opdivo and Empliciti. I'm confident we're making all of the right investments, from a commercial perspective and from an R&D perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position. 
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie to provide our 2015 financials and '16 outlook, let me say that I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb, as we have entered a period of expected growth. Driven by the unprecedented success in '15, we are in a position of strength with significant growth opportunities in I-O, where we have advanced our leadership position in Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant.

As Giovanni mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across our key brands. Total reven",1171,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will start with some comments regarding the quarter and then move on to our 2016 guidance. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across our key brands. Total revenues were $4.3 billion, up 1% over last year. With the continued strengthening of the dollar against most currencies, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of 5% in the quarter and approximately $0.08 on EPS. 
Sales for Eliquis were $602 million, more than double from fourth quarter last year. Eliquis is now the #1 NOAC in new-to-brand patient share in cardiology across 12 markets around the world, and we continue to see strong demand trends from key markets such as the U.S, Germany and Japan. 
Sales for our hepatitis C portfolio were $458 million, with most of the sales coming from Daklinza. U.S. sales were $212 million,and we are seeing strong demand since the launch in Q3. Sales in Europe were $121 million, with strong performance in Germany, France and Italy. In Japan, we had sales of $80 million, which is down significantly from Q3 sales of $175 million as recent trends reflect the pressure from new regimens that have entered the market. 
Opdivo uptake continues to be very strong, with sales of $475 million for the quarter. As Giovanni mentioned, we are seeing rapid adoption in the U.S, with Q4 sales of $410 million. About 2/3 of Opdivo sales are within lung cancer, both squamous and non-squamous. We are also seeing an increase in melanoma with the approval and launch of the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen. Our I-O portfolio now has the leading new patient share in first-line melanoma.  Opdivo has now been approved in 46 countries. The European launch for both first and second-line metastatic melanoma and squamous non-small cell lung cancer is going well in the countries where pricing has been secured, notably Germany, where we are seeing rapid uptake in both lung and melanoma. 
Sales for Yervoy were $256 million, down 28% from last year. There are 2 dynamics at play. With the U.S. approval and launch of the regimen in the adjuvant indication, we are seeing signs of stabilization there. Outside the U.S., the launch of Opdivo and KEYTRUDA are having an impact on Yervoy, where sales were down 40%. 
We launched Empliciti in the U.S. in December. We began promotional activities with just a couple of days and are in good position with access. While it's early, we are seeing a high level of interest, and recent trends are encouraging. 
We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business with sales of REYATAZ and SUSTIVA down 14% and 23%, respectively. Recall that we transferred our rights to Erbitux on October 1, and therefore, we no longer record revenues. In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux in both the U.S. and Japan were approximately $60 million and were recorded in other income. 
Now I'll comment on a few line items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 78% during the quarter. Our gross margin varies primarily due to product mix and benefited from the divestiture of Erbitux and strong Opdivo and hep C sales. As you recall, we increased investments to support important growth opportunities in our portfolio, both commercially and in R&D. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, which now includes A&P, increased about 10% in the quarter due to the increased investments in key brands, primarily Opdivo. R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments behind I-O and Empliciti, which includes clinical trials and expanding our medical organizations globally. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.1%, which reflects a full year of the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended in December. 
2015 was a very good year across the board, and we are pleased that it marks a year of both top and bottom line growth. We expect this momentum to continue in 2016, with revenues expected to grow about 5% and strong double-digit EPS growth. As you saw in our release, we are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $2.30 to $2.40. This range assumes current exchange rates. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we expect strong performance in Opdivo given the strong execution in the U.S. and launches in more countries as we secure additional approvals with associated pricing and reimbursement. Eliquis is also an important growth driver, and we are seeing strong exit trends that we will -- we believe will continue. Our hep C portfolio will continue to be a meaningful contributor to revenues, though new regimens are already having an impact in Japan, and we expect a similar situation in the U.S. later this year. 
As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind which will have an impact on our 2016 revenues. As I mentioned, we are seeing stabilization of our Yervoy business in the U.S., but ex-U.S., we are seeing pressure, particularly in the EU, and that will expand as PD-1s launch globally.  Recall that the regimen in adjuvant indication are not yet approved outside the U.S., which accounts for approximately 50% of Yervoy sales, so we do expect to continue to see the impact of PD-1s there. The HIV franchise remains under competitive pressure. 
Our mature products are a naturally declining business. In addition, the expiration of certain relationships with third-party supply agreements and the divestitures of IXEMPRA and some international products last year further impacted the category. As previously mentioned, we no longer record revenues for Erbitux. We will record royalties on Erbitux sales in other income. 
As you all know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2015 average rates. Based on current FX rates, this is expected to negatively impact our 2016 revenues by approximately 2% and $0.10 to $0.12 on earnings per share, which is factored into our guidance. 
To summarize our 2016 sales outlook, we are very pleased that our key brands that are important to our future growth are performing very well. Our underlying revenue growth, excluding the impact of Erbitux, ABILIFY exclusivity and FX, is in the low teens. Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix. For 2016, the loss of rights to ABILIFY and the structure of our co-promotion agreement for Eliquis will put downward pressure on gross margin. Partially offsetting that will be the growth in sales of new products such as Opdivo and the divestiture of Erbitux. Additionally, FX favorability that we saw on international cost of goods in 2015 is not expected to occur in 2016. 
Our operating expense projections for 2016 reflect investments that we began in the second half of last year that are continuing, particularly in R&D, which includes additional clinical trial investments, increased medical resources and Phase IV studies. We will, however, continue to be prudent with commercial resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. As Giovanni described, 2015 was an exceptional year, which provides great momentum as we enter 2016. 
Now we'd be happy to address your questions."

We are very pleased with the performance of Opdivo in 2015 and particularly the acceleration we've seen in Q4. That's clearly driven by the breadth of our label in lung cancer across all histologies regardless of PD-1 status. It's driven by the high unmet medical need in renal and, again, the strength of our overall survival data and a very solid uptake of the regimen in melanoma given the efficacy profile. We have approximately 80% of value share of the PD-1 market and very strong commercial execution. Murdo?"

I would add a couple of things to Giovanni's comments. Specifically in the lung area, we have been very pleased. As you know, we saw rapid uptake in squamous after availability of the 017 data and subsequent approval, and we've seen similar uptake now in non-squamous, where we're about 60% new patient share in second line. That profile is a very competitive profile for Opdivo. We have 2 strong indications with overall survival benefit and continue to see very strong receptivity from oncologists because of the lack of a requirement to test for PD-L1 status in lung. Now with the release of other data from our competitors, namely the 010 study, we continue to feel that, that competitiveness in second line will continue. Given the fact that we've been able to establish superiority in squamous and non-squamous separately in all-comer populations and have a resulting indication for both histologies that reflects that, we feel really good. We haven't really seen a deterioration in our new-to-patient share (sic) [new-to-brand patient share] with the advent of the 010 dataset. I think you also asked about head and neck. We see the opportunity in head and neck as really exciting. Obviously, when we see the actual full dataset, we'll know more about what to expect. But what I would say is this is a high unmet medical need area, and it's one where Opdivo in second line could represent a significant opportunity. That being said, it is a smaller tumor type. It's between -- in second line, it's between 5,000 and 10,000 treatable patients in the U.S., a little higher than that in Europe."

The 2 most recent approvals where there is more dynamic growth in the fourth quarter really were the uptake of the regimen in melanoma and renal, and we are very encouraged by both trends. Those trends will continue into 2016. We also see that in '16, we will begin to see uptake in other European countries. The only country where we really have an uptake to date is Germany, and those curves are similar to the U.S. But we are making progress with negotiating pricing and reimbursement in many other countries around the world, namely in Europe, and we will begin to see the impact of our international business later in the year."

It's early days and we have a newly expanded label to include all patients regardless of BRAF status, and so we hope that, that will continue to evolve in the U.S. Now I'll go back to comments that Charlie made. ex-U.S. for Yervoy specifically, where we don't have a regimen indication nor do we have an adjuvant indication, we would expect to see Yervoy continue to feel the pressure of the advent of first-line new patient share of Opdivo and KEYTRUDA across Europe. So expect Yervoy to have some pressure going forward ex-U.S. When it comes to renal cell carcinoma, the most recent approval for Opdivo, we're very happy and are seeing rapid uptake like we saw in melanoma and in lung, where we see roughly a 50% new patient share. Now these percentages move around there from very small datasets. We use them as directional, and we use them to estimate how rapidly behavior is changing in the market. ex-U.S., we're very happy with reimbursement evolution, and we are seeing reimbursement authorities across Europe move quickly with us to find appropriate reimbursement for patients across Europe. And we feel very good with the broad label that we have in Europe that includes both first-line melanoma for Opdivo and squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

But help me to understand -- well, I understand that Eliquis will get bigger and that puts pressure on your gross margin. The other line items of your business are growing. And when I think about the contribution of Opdivo and the growth -- the expected growth of Opdivo in 2016 relative to the expected growth of Eliquis? I would think that mix should be in your favor. You also mentioned that Erbitux would be in your favor, too. So if you can just explain why 75%, 76% versus ending the year at 77%. And then if you could also just address -- with respect to guidance, the guidance doesn't seem to imply much in the way of margin expansion.

I would say net-net, a lot of our mix almost nets off, but the bigger impact, as I mentioned in my comments, is related to FX on international cost of goods sold. If you recall, at the end of 2014, FX rates started deteriorating, and the benefit that we got is that flowed through our international cost of goods in 2015. It doesn't repeat again given the rates are -- don't have that larger dichotomy year-over-year. So that's almost 2% impact and also includes some hedging gains that flowed through cost of goods sold, again, in 2015 that [indiscernible].

And now if I understand the guidance correctly, we're really looking at late '16. So in a matter of 3 months, the timing of data disclosures can push back by about a year, and I'm wondering if you can just articulate exactly why that's the case."

As far as -227 is concerned, we're very happy with the progress of the trial. We're looking at the beginning of 2018 for that. And as we move to the combinations, I think it's just worth pointing out that when we talk about I-O combinations, we already have a combination of approved -- of 2 approved drugs. In melanoma, we've got it under review in the EU, and we've got late-stage studies in lung, renal and several other tumors. So as far as the -- the exploratory programs in novel combinations, we are getting data in-house now both in monotherapy and combination. It's possible we'll present data later in 2016, and I think depending on what we see, we could move into larger studies by year's end or early 2017. But I want to make this point, we have a very high hurdle for bringing new assets forward because, basically, it's got to be better than what we believe Opdivo-Yervoy is going to be, which already is, as far as I know, the only proven combinations that potentially show synergy. So we're very optimistic about the Yervoy regimen with Opdivo, and we will be bringing forward data later in the year on the others. Thank you."

How are you sort of thinking about next opportunities for the overall I-O story at Bristol? And then separately for Murdo, can you just help us better understand the transition that you think is going to be necessary as you shift from a broad marketing message for patients in the second-line setting to a potentially narrower PD-L1 biomarker-driven message post a hopefully successful CheckMate -026 study?"

We are, again, looking at IPI and NIVO together in a number of trials at the moment. And then in those areas where, as you said, unmet need, those rapid progressors in lung and those that relapse in lung and, certainly, those tumors where there has been modest benefit from monotherapy, we think there's a particular opportunity as new and novel combinations come forward to perhaps meet the unmet need there. So with our portfolio, as Giovanni mentioned, now of 8 combinations -- 8 assets with 3 more to come in this year, we think we're going to be driven by the science and the clinical data.

We have a very strong commercial and medical organization worldwide. We've seen very rapid uptake across the board in the U.S. We're seeing it in Germany. We're actually seeing it in France as well. It's just not translating into revenue recognition there because it's in the ATU. And we have a high degree of readiness in Japan. But really, we've got clarity on our dosing, we have a strong customer-centric organization, a breadth of indications beyond lung and a very strong clinical development program. One thing to keep in mind is what we are seeing in the lung market is there is a slow moving but growing evolution of testing, particularly in first line. So testing in second line is a difficult proposition, as you know, because of ability to rebiopsy your assessed tissue. But we are seeing first-line testing in the range of about 60%. And we are very, very focused on ensuring that the Opdivo biomarker PD-L1 test is available everywhere where we market the product. So we think we'll be in really good shape for a PD-L1 selected population in first line, and I think we'll have all the necessary commercial and medical capabilities for that period in time."

I must say that, while many of our deals last year where smaller deals on early assets, they all are extremely interesting from a scientific perspective. And actually, 2015 was a year of unprecedented activity for us from a business development perspective. First, we continue to be very active in immuno-oncology. I know you were joking when you said it's on autopilot, but in reality, we really feel we are at the very beginning of an extraordinary story in immuno-oncology. And we continue to be very focused not only on delivering the value of the portfolio and the pipeline we have but also continuing to strengthen that. And going back to what I said a few minutes ago, the agreements we reached in 2015 really has -- have strengthened immuno-oncology, particularly in the tumor microenvironment. Second, we are focused on diversifying beyond immuno-oncology. We have signed some important agreements last year that have strengthened our pipeline in cardiovascular medicines, where we're now combining internal and external. We have a really attractive approach to heart failure. We are building a very differentiated early pipeline in fibrosis, continuing to advance interesting assets in Immunoscience. And as you know, we have 2 genetically defined disease products in the clinic as well. So that, coupled with the strengthening performance of Eliquis, provides a good platform for growth outside of oncology as well. And with respect to your question regarding the size of the deals, as we've said in the past, we are agnostic.

It seems like longer, but we've only really been in the market in lung since March of last year. And you really need 24 months to have a 12-month look-back to get to an accurate duration of therapy, so it's still difficult to elucidate that. So we don't have a good number for you there.

We made a conscious decision, an important decision to invest in DTC advertising for lung cancer because we feel there is a long history of treatments that have not delivered significant value to patients with lung cancer. There is pessimism for many patients and the number of patients particularly in the second-line setting that are not being treated as aggressively as they should be treated. So as for the first time, we've been able to offer a really meaningful opportunity through Opdivo to patients, pretreated patients with lung cancer. We felt it was important to invest in a campaign and, in many ways, mobilize patients to seek treatment now that an option is available. Charlie or Murdo, on pricing?"

We just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some an important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio. We have entered the period",1024,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some an important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio. 
We have entered the period of growth I've discussed before. We had $4.4 billion in sales, 9% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong given the loss of exclusivity for Abilify in April last year and the fact that we no longer book sales for Erbitux due to changes in our agreement with Lilly. 
Let me share just a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands. 
Starting with Eliquis. Global sales for the quarter was $734 million more than doubling sales from a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter growth was more than 20%, and we continue to make progress towards market leadership in key markets globally. 
In the U.S., Eliquis is now the #1 global anticoagulant in brand prescriptions for both Heyphiv and BD across all physicians. 
Beyond the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 NOAC in prescriptions among cardiologists in 12 markets around the world. 
Based on this performance, we are well on our way to becoming the #1 NOAC globally. 
Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance as well, with $427 million in revenues in the first quarter. I'm very pleased with our strong performance, particularly in the U.S. This is, however, a very competitive and highly dynamic market, and we do expect competitions to have a significant impact on our business in the U.S. for the rest of the year as we've already seen in Japan. 
Orencia's price also had good quarters. Orencia had revenues of $475 million, up 19% from a year ago. 
Sprycel posted sales of $407 million, up 9% from last year. 
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've had a very strong start of the year, building on our leadership position. 
Commercially, the launch of Opdivo continues to accelerate based on continued approvals and new indications around the world. 
First quarter sales were $704 million. Physician adoption of Opdivo remains strong in markets where we have launched, with PD-1 dollars shares of more than 80% in the U.S. and comparable shares in other key markets, including Germany, France and Japan. 
In lung cancer, Opdivo remains the clear leader across histologists. Our key competitive advantages remain, our overall survival data and the fact that physicians can treat patients with Opdivo regardless of PD-L1 expression. 
In melanoma, we have the broadest portfolio of treatment options in both the adjuvant and the metastatic setting, including the first immuno-oncology combination with Opdivo + Yervoy. 
Opdivo-based treatments are the leading treatments in new patients in first line melanoma in the U.S, driven by strong adoption of the combination regimen. The adoption of our combination therapy has been strong in both academic and community settings. 
And in renal cancer, overall survival and durability of response with Opdivo are recognized by prescribers, and Opdivo is the leading treatment for newly diagnosed second line patients. 
With respect to R&D, we are already off to a good start in 2016. Earlier this month, the European Commission approved expanded use of Opdivo in non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and in advanced renal cell carcinoma, and we received a positive CHMP opinion for our Opdivo + Yervoy combination for the treatment of melanoma. 
In addition, we have received breakthrough designation for our Opdivo filing in the U.S. for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Our filing has been granted priority review by the FDA and the EMA has validated our application. 
Overall, Opdivo has the potential to become the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in a hematological malignancy in the U.S., in Europe and in Japan. 
Earlier this month at AACR, we present the data from our CheckMate -141 study in patients with head and neck cancer. This study, which was talked earlier this year, is the fifth tumor type with overall survival data for Opdivo compared to a standard of care. 
And earlier this week, we received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in head and neck cancer. 
We also presented for the first time 2-year overall survival data of r our Opdivo + Yervoy regimen, CheckMate -069 in patients with advanced melanoma. We continue to believe that the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen provides the best opportunity for patients to benefit from the long-term survival opportunity that immunotherapy offers. 
Looking ahead, ASCO will, again, be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting longer term follow up from some studies that have previously been presented, including the combination of Opdivo + Yervoy in non-small cell lung cancer from CheckMate -012. 
In addition, we will be presenting data in new tumor types for Opdivo monotherapy,and we are looking forward to presenting new data from studies of our Opdivo + Yervoy combination, including data in new tumors not previously presented. 
And lastly, you'll  see the data from registration of studies, including Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck. 
All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments with immuno-oncology, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications. 
Going forward, we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. I'm confident we are making all of the right investments from both a commercial and in R&D perspective continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position. 
Before turning the floor over to Charlie, let me say that I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased sales and EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. 
We have significant growth opportunities in I-O, where we have advanced our leadership position with Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong, and we are advancing a diverse, innovative and promising pipeline by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need. 
And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."
25798,328320663,965772,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter driven by strong performance across our key products. Overall, FX had a negative 2% impact on sales and about $0.03 on EPS. Giovanni covered the sales perform",872,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter driven by strong performance across our key products. 
Overall, FX had a negative 2% impact on sales and about $0.03 on EPS. Giovanni covered the sales performance highlights from some of our key growth drivers. I will just add some additional color. 
Eliquis continues to do very well. Sales in the U.S. were $468 million, which includes a onetime positive adjustment related to the Medicare coverage gap of $25 million. 
We continue to see strong performance for Opdivo across the 3 tumors. Opdivo continues to be the most prescribed drug for new patients in lung cancer. Renal has also seen strong early adoption. And in melanoma, the strong performance of the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen is contributing to the growth for both Opdivo and Yervoy. 
Opdivo has now been approved in 50 countries. International sales in Q1 were $110 million. Until recently, the EU approved non-squamous lung cancer and melanoma only. Pricing and reimbursement for melanoma and squamous lung cancer has been secured in most of the major markets and uptake remains strong, notably in Germany and France, where we're operating through an early access program.  Additional indications for renal and non-squamous lung cancer have now been approved with the EU. The CHMP has also granted a positive opinion for the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen in melanoma. 
Yervoy sales in the U.S. grew 10% over last year based on the strength of the regimen, which as Giovanni mentioned has seen strong adoption in first line melanoma. 
Internationally, sales were down over 50% as Yervoy monotherapy remains under pressure from Opdivo and KEYTRUDA. We expect that to continue into the launch of the regimen, which should take place over the next year or so. 
Our hep C business was strong in the U.S. and Europe where Daklinza is holding up well, primarily in the genotype 3 patient population. We do, however, expect competition to significantly impact the business in the second half of the year. 
In Japan, where we are competing in the genotype 1 population, new competitive launches have led to significant drop off of our business there. 
The launch of Empliciti in the U.S. is going very well with sales in the quarter of $28 million. We are seeing good usage in key accounts in the U.S. 
In Europe, we have CHMP positive opinion and hope to gain approval later this quarter.  We do think reimbursement will be a bit more challenging there given that multiple myeloma is a longer-term treatment and combining novel therapies can be challenging for payers. 
We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business with sales of Reyataz and Sustiva down from prior year. Recent competitive launches are expected to further impact the Sustiva business in particular. 
Gross margin was 76% during the quarter, down 370 basis points compared to the same period last year. You will recall that we had favorable FX impact on international inventory sold last year. 
In addition, our gross margin was impacted by product mix, driven by Eliquis and the loss of a Abilify where we had full quarter of sales in the first quarter of last year. 
In SNA, which now includes AMP was up about 4% due to investments in Opdivo, Eliquis and Empliciti, offset by lower spend on older products, including Erbitux, which is now fully supported by Lilly. 
Additionally, there was a $36 million favorable adjustment related to our prior year pharmacy based on the actual invoice received. 
R&D expenses were up 17%. The increase in spending was due to higher clinical cost, including study supplies, new business development in research alliances and I-O trial. We also have higher medical investments, including data-generating studies and field support. 
Other income and expense is up approximately $160 million versus prior year. Diabetes royalties are higher due to increased sales and the transfer our future of Anlin-related royalty rights, which will lead to increased royalties over the next years. 
Recall that due to the tiered structure of the agreement with AstraZeneca, the diabetes royalties are somewhat front-loaded and will decline throughout the year. 
In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux were approximately $60 million and were recorded in other income. 
Moving to guidance. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.20. Our new range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen and euro, we now expect the negative impact of FX on EPS to be between $0.06 and $0.08. This is approximately a $0.04 improvement since original guidance of which $0.01 was already been realized in Q1. 
We raised revenue guidance due to the strong trends across the business, primarily Opdivo and Eliquis. The negative FX impact on revenues is now expected to be approximately 1%. 
We are increasing our guidance on MS&A mostly due to higher commercial spending on I-O, including additional DTC spend. 
The increased investments in R&D are primarily for clinical study supplies, new BD alliances and the development of additional biomarkers and diagnostics and oncology. 
Overall, a strong start to the year, which provides us with great confidence in how we see the full year. 
Now, we'd be happy to address your questions."

If you recall, we have our indication in metastatic melanoma, squamous lung at the beginning of our uptake curve and then recently additional approvals coming that are yet really showing in our demand curves. We've also seen, is Giovanni mentioned, very good response to the value of Opdivo in terms of our reimbursement negotiations, many of those negotiations and discussions with the various governments in Europe have gone quicker. So we now enjoy a good access in Germany, France as well as recently Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, we're continuing to work with.

Now regarding CheckMate -026, we said that both the events and the timing of follow up were important considerations for the timing of the analysis. And I want to say that based on what we now know about the progress of the trial in the current event rate, we believe we could have the results in CheckMate -026 in the third quarter, which as you appreciate is earlier than we previously estimated.

And of course, to generate data to inform future combinations. So therefore, the fraction trust should allow us to officially identify the activity of promising novel combinations and quickly move them into potentially registration or trials. Now as we've said, data from our earlier asset started coming into us this year, and we're moving forward with the Anti-LAG 3 antibody fraction study as we think there is an opportunity to improve upon Opdivo monotherapy or the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, particularly as you say in those patients who don't  respond initially or who relapse. I think the important thing to say, and to put this in the context, a broader context is that we are very confident our broad strategy in first line lung, and we want it to address a very broad population. Now we clearly have emphasis on first line. We already have second line, but we do believe that the Opdivo+Yervoy regimens could further improve overall survival. And I want to note we're looking forward to presenting additional data for -012 at ASCO. So overall, we want to show as many lung cancer patients that been benefit, whether that's with monotherapy, combination of Opdivo Yervoy, exploring other combinations where fraction will allow us to do more quickly and efficiently and very that's targeted therapies or, indeed, chemotherapy, so very broad program.

Obviously, investors are very focused on the upcoming frontline lung studies from both Merck, and you guys. Can you compare and contrast the first, the 2 first line monotherapy trials of Opdivo versus KEYTRUDA since that's what probably where we're focused on? And I think that investors seem can have more confidence in the work trial because they are looking at the highest expressers of PD-L1 expression compared to your trial. So I think there's more confidence that they're going to hit on PFS versus Bristol-Myers. Plus there's also worry out there about PFS being a talent end point  just given that chemotherapy works pretty well in frontline lung. So if you can address that for us. And then secondly, a more bigger picture strategy question for the long term. Obviously, monotherapy Opdivo is doing extremely well, but as you know, the doctors prefer combination therapy and treating cancer patients and they also want to move away from chemotherapy. So can you set the stage for Opdivo combination strategies and the outlook over the next couple of years, given that a number of companies have chosen the different path which is chemo combo?"

Let me just start with your second question and give you my perspective on strategy in first line lung cancer. Francis will add to comments and answer specifically to your questions about study design. I feel very strongly, and I am very optimistic about our strategy in first line because we obviously have a lot of experience in lung cancer through our second line registrational strategy, which has given us not only a very broad approval but also very clear insights into physicians' prescribing behavior, behaviors the adoption of Opdivo, the speed at which chemotherapy has been abandoned and while there obviously differences between first line and second line, we really think we have developed a deep knowledge of this market, specifically as it relates to immunotherapy. So when you think about our strategy, our approach is broad and informed by science. We have -- I am convinced that the right approach of investigating monotherapy, both in a broader population of PD-L1 positive patients and in a subset of patients that express PD-1 at a higher level. We have advanced, really, exciting combination strategy through study 12 and obviously the Phase III study ongoing, and we also investigating the right combination of chemotherapy in the right patient subgroups. And so when you look at the totality of our first line lung strategy, we believe it is the broadest approach, it is informed by data and science and are really strong understanding of market dynamics."

We think we've got the optimal balance of speed and designs and to deliver results, not just in a narrow population but in their why this population of first line lung patients as we've done with other studies of Opdivo recently. Just to be very specific, in the trial design, we're looking at both strongly expressing patients and patients with any level of expression. We've not actually disclosed the actual level of what strongly expressing PD-1 is, but it's lower than 50%. It's not clear to us that you need to have very high levels of PD-L1 expression to benefit from treatment. And if you recall the OS curves from over -057, the shapes of the [indiscernible] was similar across the 1%, 5% and 10%. So overall, everything we know has gone into the study.

And first line lung, most companies have taken fairly similar approach to monotherapy as we've heard by looking at the rich population. But on the other hand, the strategies with combination regimens like the Opdivo+Yervoy 1 C in -012, the approaches there are quite different. Some are focused, as you know, on combinations with chemo other than looking at combination for low-PD-L1 non expressers. We actually believe our strategy is quite differentiated, and we believe that -- I want to reemphasize is that I-O combination, specifically Opdivo + Yervoy is the best way to improve upon the survival expeditions for the patience over the long term. Now, we're very encouraged by the safety and efficacy of dosing of the regimen in non-small-cell lung based on the data we presented last year at the World Lung conference. And we're really looking forward to presenting an update of CheckMate -012 at ASCO in June. So that will be a more mature data set and of course, it's under embargo, so I can't say anything more about it now.

That hasn't changed either. And overall survival is a secondary endpoint and will also be analyzed as this is obviously clinically important, but I think it's worth reminding everyone that OS can could be confounded by the crossover, which is allowed within this particular trial. So let me just say, nothing has changed in terms of the analysis. What we're able to do as we watched the drug -- I'm sorry, as we watch the study mature in terms of the duration of therapy and the event rate is that we were able to advance it forward without an increased risk through the study. Now just a quick note on fraction. Fraction is a study that gives us enormous flexibility. So you picked up on an interesting point, there are a lot of patience in this, but it allows us depending on the data to move to additional ARMs or to ramp up in the ARMs there. So it's not the same as you expect for registration of study where you come up with the number at the beginning. It's about the efficiency, it's about speed, it's about being able to identify signals and move quickly should we see them. Thank you very much."

So while we are focused on I-O combinations, we're certainly open to the idea of chemo in certain patients segments. I think as far as the small cell lung cancer, which you intimated from your question about TLL4, chemotherapy there has an important role to play and TLL4 the target is one way of addressing that with an ADC.

We just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio.
We have entered the period of growth I've discussed before. We had $4.4 billion in sales, 9% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong given the loss of exclusivity for ABILIFY in April last year and the fact that we no longer book sales for Erbitux due to changes in our agreement with Lilly.
Let me share just a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands.
Starting with Eliquis. Global sales for the quarter was $734 million more than doubling sales from a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter growth was more than 20%, and we continue to make progress towards market leadership in key markets globally.
In the U.S., Eliquis is now the #1 novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions for both AFib and VTE across all physicians. 
Beyond the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 NOAC in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists in 12 markets around the world.
Based on this performance, we are well on our way to becoming the #1 NOAC globally.
Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance as well, with $427 million in revenues in the first quarter. I'm very pleased with our strong performance, particularly in the U.S. This is, however, a very competitive and highly dynamic market, and we do expect competitions to have a significant impact on our business in the U.S. for the rest of the year as we've already seen in Japan.
ORENCIA's price had -- also had good quarters. ORENCIA had revenues of $475 million, up 19% from a year ago.
SPRYCEL posted sales of $407 million, up 9% from last year.
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've had a very strong start of the year, building on our leadership position. 
Commercially, the launch of OPDIVO continues to accelerate based on continued approvals and new indications around the world.
First quarter sales were $704 million. Physician adoption of OPDIVO remains strong in markets where we have launched, with PD-1 dollar shares of more than 80% in the U.S. and comparable shares in other key markets, including Germany, France and Japan.
In lung cancer, OPDIVO remains the clear leader across histologists. Our key competitive advantages remain, our overall survival data and the fact that physicians can treat patients with OPDIVO regardless of PD-L1 expression.
In melanoma, we have the broadest portfolio of treatment options in both the adjuvant and the metastatic setting, including the first immuno-oncology combination with OPDIVO+YERVOY.
OPDIVO-based treatments are the leading treatments in new patients in first line melanoma in the U.S, driven by strong adoption of the combination regimen. The adoption of our combination therapy has been strong in both academic and community settings.
And in renal cancer, overall survival and durability of response with OPDIVO are recognized by prescribers, and OPDIVO is the leading treatment for newly diagnosed second line patients.
With respect to R&D, we are already off to a good start in 2016. Earlier this month, the European Commission approved expanded use of OPDIVO in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and in advanced renal cell carcinoma, and we received a positive CHMP opinion for our OPDIVO+YERVOY combination for the treatment of melanoma.
In addition, we have received breakthrough designation for our OPDIVO filing in the U.S. for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Our filing has been granted priority review by the FDA and the EMA has validated our application.
Overall, OPDIVO has the potential to become the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in a hematological malignancy in the U.S., in Europe and in Japan.
Earlier this month at AACR, we presented data from our CheckMate -141 study in patients with head and neck cancer. The study, which was stopped earlier this year, is the fifth tumor type with overall survival data for OPDIVO compared to a standard of care.
And earlier this week, we received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in head and neck cancer.
We also presented for the first time 2-year overall survival data from our OPDIVO+YERVOY regimen, CheckMate -069 in patients with advanced melanoma. We continue to believe that the OPDIVO+YERVOY regimen provides the best opportunity for patients to benefit from the long-term survival opportunity that immunotherapy offers.
Looking ahead, ASCO will again be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting longer term follow up from some studies that have previously been presented, including the combination of OPDIVO+YERVOY in non-small cell lung cancer from CheckMate -012.
In addition, we will be presenting data in new tumor types for OPDIVO monotherapy,and we are looking forward to presenting new data from studies of our OPDIVO+YERVOY combination, including data in new tumors not previously presented.
And lastly, you'll see the data from registration of studies, including Hodgkin lymphoma, and head and neck. 
All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments with immuno-oncology, including our ability to establish OPDIVO as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications.
Going forward, we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. I'm confident we are making all of the right investments from both a commercial and in R&D perspective continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.
Before turning the floor over to Charlie, let me say that I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased sales and EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business.
We have significant growth opportunities in I-O, where we have advanced our leadership position with OPDIVO. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong, and we are advancing a diverse, innovative and promising pipeline by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need.
And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

Overall, FX had a negative 2% impact on sales and about $0.03 on EPS. Giovanni covered the sales performance highlights from some of our key growth drivers. I will just add some additional color.
Eliquis continues to do very well. Sales in the U.S. were $468 million, which includes a onetime positive adjustment related to the Medicare coverage gap of $25 million.
We continue to see strong performance for OPDIVO across the 3 tumors. OPDIVO continues to be the most prescribed drug for new patients in lung cancer. Renal has also seen strong early adoption. And in melanoma, the strong performance of the OPDIVO+YERVOY regimen is contributing to the growth for both OPDIVO and YERVOY.
OPDIVO has now been approved in 50 countries. International sales in Q1 were $110 million. Until recently, the EU approval was in squamous lung cancer and melanoma only. Pricing and reimbursement for melanoma and squamous lung cancer has been secured in most of the major markets and uptake remains strong, notably in Germany and France where we are operating through an early access program. Additional indications for renal and non-squamous lung cancer have now been approved with the EU. The CHMP has also granted a positive opinion for the OPDIVO+YERVOY regimen in melanoma. 
YERVOY sales in the U.S. grew 10% over last year based on the strength of the regimen, which as Giovanni mentioned, has seen strong adoption in first line melanoma.
Internationally, sales were down over 50% as YERVOY monotherapy remains under pressure from OPDIVO and KEYTRUDA. We expect that to continue into the launch of the regimen, which should take place over the next year or so.
Our hep C business was strong in the U.S. and Europe where Daklinza is holding up well, primarily in the genotype 3 patient population. We do, however, expect competition to significantly impact the business in the second half of the year.
In Japan, where we are competing in the genotype 1 population, new competitive launches have led to significant drop off of our business there. 
The launch of EMPLICITI in the U.S. is going very well with sales in the quarter of $28 million. We are seeing good usage in key accounts in the U.S.
In Europe, we have a CHMP positive opinion and hope to gain approval later this quarter. We do think reimbursement will be a bit more challenging there given that multiple myeloma is a longer-term treatment and combining novel therapies could be challenging for payers.
We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business with sales of REYATAZ and SUSTIVA down from prior year. Recent competitive launches are expected to further impact the Sustiva business in particular.
Gross margin was 76% during the quarter, down 370 basis points compared to the same period last year. You will recall that we had a favorable FX impact on international inventory sold last year. In addition, our gross margin was impacted by product mix, driven by Eliquis and the loss of a ABILIFY where we had full quarter of sales in the first quarter of last year.
MS&A, which now includes AMP was up about 4% due to investments in OPDIVO, ELIQUIS and EMPLICITI, offset by lower spend on older products, including Erbitux, which is now fully supported by Lilly. 
Additionally, there was a $36 million favorable adjustment related to our prior year pharmacy based on the actual invoice received.
R&D expenses were up 17%. The increase in spending was due to higher clinical cost, including study supplies, new business development in research alliances and I-O trial. We also have higher medical investments, including data-generating studies and field support.
Other income and expense is up approximately $160 million versus prior year. Diabetes royalties are higher due to increased sales and the transfer of future of Amylin-related royalty rights, which will lead to increased royalties over the next few years.
Recall that due to the tiered structure of the agreement with AstraZeneca, the diabetes royalties are somewhat front-loaded and will decline throughout the year.
In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux were approximately $60 million and were recorded in other income.
Moving to guidance. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.20. Our new range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen and euro, we now expect the negative impact of FX on EPS to be between $0.06 and $0.08. This is approximately a $0.04 improvement since original guidance of which $0.01 was already been realized in Q1.
We raised revenue guidance due to the strong trends across the business, primarily OPDIVO and Eliquis. The negative FX impact on revenues is now expected to be approximately 1%.
We are increasing our guidance on MS&A mostly due to higher commercial spending on I-O, including additional DTC spend.
The increased investments in R&D are primarily for clinical study supplies, new BD alliances and the development of additional biomarkers and diagnostics and oncology.
Overall, a strong start to the year, which provides us with great confidence in how we see the full year.
Now, we'd be happy to address your questions."

We've also seen, as Giovanni mentioned, very good response to the value of OPDIVO in terms of our reimbursement negotiations. Many of those negotiations and discussions with the various governments in Europe have gone quicker. So we now enjoy a good access in Germany, France as well as recently Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, we're continuing to work with.

So let me just say, Seamus, that -- let me give you a little bit background on fraction. This is an innovative of Phase I, Phase II design for early combination trials and as you appreciate, we have a number of potential combinations at the moment. And this allows us to look at promising signals of activity to actually also test hypothesis about the underlying biology of combinations, and as well as checkpoint, we have a number of none effect of mechanisms as well. And of course, to generate data to inform future combinations. So therefore, the fraction trial should allow us to efficiently identify the activity of promising novel combinations and quickly move them into potentially registrational trials. Now as we've said, data from our only asset has started coming into house this year, and we're moving forward with the anti-LAG-3 antibody fraction study as we think there is an opportunity to improve upon OPDIVO monotherapy or the combination of OPDIVO and YERVOY, particularly as you say in those patients who don't respond initially or who relapse. I think the important thing to say and to put this in the context, the broader context, is that we are very confident in our broad strategy in first line lung, and we want it to address a very broad population. Now we clearly have emphasis on first line. We already have second line, but we do believe that the OPDIVO+YERVOY regimens could further improve overall survival. And I want to note that we're looking forward to presenting additional data from -012 at ASCO. So overall, we wanted to show as many lung cancer patients that been benefit, whether that's with monotherapy, combination of OPDIVO+YERVOY, exploring other combinations, which fraction will allow us to do more quickly and efficiently, and whether that's targeted therapies or indeed, chemotherapy. So a very broad program. Thank you."

Obviously, investors are very focused on the upcoming frontline lung studies from both Merck and you guys. Can you compare and contrast the first -- the 2 first-line monotherapy trials of OPDIVO versus KEYTRUDA since that's obviously what we're focused on? And I think that investors seem to have more confidence in the Merck trial because they are looking at the highest expressers of PD-L1 expression compared to your trial. So I think there's more confidence that they're going to hit on PFS versus Bristol-Myers. Plus, there's also worry out there about PFS being a challenging end point just given that chemotherapy works pretty well in frontline lung. So if you can address that for us. And then secondly, a more bigger picture strategy question for the long term. Obviously, monotherapy OPDIVO is doing extremely well, but as you know, doctors prefer combination therapy in treating cancer patients and they also want to move away from chemotherapy. So can you set the stage for OPDIVO combination strategies and the outlook over the next couple of years, given that a number of companies have chosen the different path which is chemo combo?"

So when you think about our strategy, our approach is broad and informed by science. We have -- I am convinced that the right approach of investigating monotherapy, both in a broader population of PD-L1 positive patients and in a subset of patients that express PD-1 at a higher level. We have advanced, really, exciting combination strategy through Study 012 and obviously the Phase III study ongoing, and we are also investigating the right combination of chemotherapy in the right patient subgroups. And so when you look at the totality of our first line lung strategy, we believe it is the broadest approach, it is informed by data and science and a really strong understanding of market dynamics."

We think we've got the optimal balance of speeds and design and to deliver results, not just in a narrow population but in the widest population of first line lung patients as we've done with other studies of OPDIVO recently. Just to be very specific, in the trial design, we're looking at both strongly expressing patients and patients with any level of expression. We've not actually disclosed the actual level of what strongly expressing PD-1 is, but it's lower than 50%. It's not clear to us that you need to have very high levels of PD-L1 expression to benefit from treatment. And if you recall the OS curves from 057, the shapes of the Kaplan-Meier curves was similar across the 1%, 5% and 10% cutoffs. So overall, everything we know has gone into the study.

And overall survival is the secondary endpoint and will also be analyzed as this is obviously clinically important, but I think it's worth reminding everyone that OS could be confounded by the crossover, which is allowed within this particular trial. So let me just say, nothing has changed in terms of the analysis. What we're able to do as we've watched the drug -- I'm sorry, as we watch the study mature in terms of the duration of therapy and the event rate is that we were able to advance it forward without any increased risk to the study. Now just a quick note on fraction. Fraction is a study that gives us enormous flexibility. So you've picked up on an interesting point, there are a lot of patients in this, but it allows us, depending on the data, to move to additional arms or to ramp up in the arms there. So it's not the same as you expect for a registrational study where you come up with the number at the beginning. It's about the efficiency, it's about speed, it's about being able to identify signals and move quickly should we see them. Thank you very much."

So I think what you're referring to is the blueprint study at the AACR.

This was across industry collaboration between 4 pharmaceutical companies, including us and 2 diagnostic companies. And the idea was to provide greater clarity on the analytical performance of each assay. Now the results indicated that 2 of the assays appear to be highly correlated and 3 of the 4 assays were analytically similar. And in this first phase of the study, while some differences were due to scoring approaches and selective cutoffs, the assays were deemed not identical and interchangeable at this point in time. And I think one would say these preliminary results are not intended to alter the current guidelines for each diagnostic. But also I want to say is very importantly, these findings confirm the quality and the utility of our assay. So anyway, we're moving forward into the second phase. We'll have to see how that goes, but obviously, we're working hard with others to try and get to a point where there is some interchangeability. Thank you."

As far as LAG-3, I think as I've already said, I was -- and I appreciate how closely people look at the ClinicalTrials.gov data, but particularly in the fraction context, particularly these adaptable and flexible trials, some of the changes, even quite large changes in number of people and duration, don't, necessarily correlate with how the drug is and isn't going. And particularly in this trial, I think, we removed one site or a country and as a result, you saw the big change in the numbers. So it's not representative of the progress. As far as novel I-O combinations, I did want just to say that first of all, we're very excited about the progress we're making with what has now become fairly conventional but still effective I-O combination of OPDIVO+YERVOY. As you appreciate it, as Charlie mentioned, it's approved in the United States now and should be approved soon in Europe when we have a number of trials ongoing and plans, some registration in lung and renal, as you've mentioned, others exploratory, and you'll be seeing data from some of those at ASCO also.

Second question for Murdo and Francis on the regulatory timing around Hodgkin's lymphoma, and head and neck cancer. Can you give some clarity on filing in U.S., Europe and Japan? And then on the commercial side, what additional incremental investment do you have to make on those two indications. You obviously have the SPRYCEL sales force in place but don't actively sell in head and neck. Just a little bit of clarity on investment. And then lastly, for Charlie, on leverage with the revenue going higher and potentially going higher in the out years. So as you optimize all of these indications, how you're thinking 2017 and beyond about operating leverage."

We just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio.
We have entered the period of growth I've discussed before. We had $4.4 billion in sales, 9% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong given the loss of exclusivity for Abilify in April last year and the fact that we no longer book sales of Erbitux due to changes in our agreement with Lilly.
Let me share just a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands.
Starting with Eliquis. Global sales for the quarter were $734 million, more than doubling sales from a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter growth was more than 20%, and we continue to make progress towards market leadership in key markets globally.
In the U.S., Eliquis is now the #1 novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions for both AFib and VTE across all physicians. 
Beyond the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 NOAC in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists in 12 markets around the world.
Based on this performance, we are well on our way to becoming the #1 NOAC globally.
Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance as well, with $427 million in revenues in the first quarter. I'm very pleased with our strong performance, particularly in the U.S. This is, however, a very competitive and highly dynamic market, and we do expect competitions to have a significant impact on our business in the U.S. for the rest of the year as we've already seen in Japan.
price Orencia's had -- also had good quarters. Orencia had revenues of $475 million, up 19% from a year ago.
Sprycel posted sales of $407 million, up 9% from last year.
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've had a very strong start of the year, building on our leadership position. 
Commercially, the launch of Opdivo continues to accelerate based on continued approvals and new indications around the world.
First quarter sales were $704 million. Physician adoption of Opdivo remains strong in markets where we have launched, with PD-1 dollar shares of more than 80% in the U.S. and comparable shares in other key markets, including Germany, France and Japan.
In lung cancer, Opdivo remains the clear leader across histologists. Our key competitive advantages remain our overall survival data and the fact that physicians can treat patients with Opdivo regardless of PD-L1 expression.
In melanoma, we have the broadest portfolio of treatment options in both the adjuvant and the metastatic setting, including the first immuno-oncology combination with Opdivo+Yervoy.
Opdivo-based treatments are the leading treatments in new patients in first line melanoma in the U.S, driven by strong adoption of the combination regimen. The adoption of our combination therapy has been strong in both academic and community settings.
And in renal cancer, overall survival and durability of response with Opdivo are recognized by prescribers, and Opdivo is the leading treatment for newly diagnosed second-line patients.
With respect to R&D, we are already off to a good start in 2016. Earlier this month, the European Commission approved expanded use of Opdivo in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer and in advanced renal cell carcinoma, and we received a positive CHMP opinion for our Opdivo+Yervoy combination for the treatment of melanoma.
In addition, we have received breakthrough designation for our Opdivo filing in the U.S. for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Our filing has been granted priority review by the FDA and the EMA has validated our application.
Overall, Opdivo has the potential to become the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in a hematological malignancy in the U.S., in Europe and in Japan.
Earlier this month at AACR, we presented data from our CheckMate -141 study in patients with head and neck cancer. The study, which was stopped earlier this year, is the fifth tumor type with overall survival data for Opdivo compared to a standard of care.
And earlier this week, we received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in head and neck cancer.
We also presented for the first time, 2-year overall survival data from our Opdivo+Yervoy regimen, CheckMate -069, in patients with advanced melanoma. We continue to believe that the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen provides the best opportunity for patients to benefit from the long-term survival opportunity that immunotherapy offers.
Looking ahead, ASCO will again be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting longer term follow up from some studies that have previously been presented, including the combination of Opdivo+Yervoy in non-small cell lung cancer from CheckMate -012.
In addition, we will be presenting data in new tumor types for Opdivo monotherapy, and we are looking forward to presenting new data from studies of our Opdivo+Yervoy combination, including data in new tumors not previously presented.
And lastly, you'll see the data from registration of studies, including Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck. 
All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments with immuno-oncology, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications.
Going forward, we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. I'm confident we are making all of the right investments from both a commercial and an R&D perspective [ph]  Continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.
Before turning the floor over to Charlie, let me say that I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased sales and EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business.
We have significant growth opportunities in I-O, where we have advanced our leadership position with Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong, and we are advancing a diverse, innovative and promising pipeline by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need.
And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter driven by strong performance across our key products.Overall, FX had a negative 2% impact on sales and about $0.03 on EPS. Giovanni covered the sales performa",870,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter driven by strong performance across our key products.
Overall, FX had a negative 2% impact on sales and about $0.03 on EPS. Giovanni covered the sales performance highlights from some of our key growth drivers. I will just add some additional color.
Eliquis continues to do very well. Sales in the U.S. were $468 million, which includes a onetime positive adjustment related to the Medicare coverage gap of $25 million.
We continue to see strong performance for Opdivo across the 3 tumors. Opdivo continues to be the most prescribed drug for new patients in lung cancer. Renal has also seen strong early adoption. And in melanoma, the strong performance of the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen is contributing to the growth for both Opdivo and Yervoy.
Opdivo has now been approved in 50 countries. International sales in Q1 were $110 million. Until recently, the EU approval was in squamous lung cancer and melanoma only. Pricing and reimbursement for melanoma and squamous lung cancer has been secured in most of the major markets and uptake remains strong, notably in Germany and France where we are operating through an early access program. Additional indications for renal and non-squamous lung cancer have now been approved with the EU. The CHMP has also granted a positive opinion for the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen in melanoma. 
Yervoy sales in the U.S. grew 10% over last year based on the strength of the regimen, which as Giovanni mentioned, has seen strong adoption in first line melanoma.
Internationally, sales were down over 50% as Yervoy monotherapy remains under pressure from Opdivo and Keytruda. We expect that to continue into the launch of the regimen, which should take place over the next year or so.
Our hep C business was strong in the U.S. and Europe where Daklinza is holding up well, primarily in the genotype-3 patient population. We do, however, expect competition to significantly impact the business in the second half of the year.
In Japan, where we are competing in the genotype-1 population, new competitive launches have led to significant drop off of our business there. 
The launch of Empliciti in the U.S. is going very well with sales in the quarter of $28 million. We are seeing good usage in key accounts in the U.S.
In Europe, we have a CHMP positive opinion and hope to gain approval later this quarter. We do think reimbursement will be a bit more challenging there given that multiple myeloma is a longer-term treatment and combining novel therapies could be challenging for payers.
We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business with sales of Reyataz and Sustiva down from prior year. Recent competitive launches are expected to further impact the Sustiva business in particular.
Gross margin was 76% during the quarter, down 370 basis points compared to the same period last year. You will recall that we had a favorable FX impact on international inventory sold last year. In addition, our gross margin was impacted by product mix, driven by Eliquis and the loss of a Abilify where we had full quarter of sales in the first quarter of last year.
MS&A, which now includes A&P, was up about 4% due to investments in Opdivo, Eliquis and Empliciti, offset by lower spend on older products, including Erbitux, which is now fully supported by Lilly. 
Additionally, there was a $36 million favorable adjustment related to our prior year pharmacy based on the actual invoice received.
R&D expenses were up 17%. The increase in spending was due to higher clinical costs, including study supplies, new business development in research alliances and I-O trial. We also have higher medical investments, including data-generating studies and field support.
Other income and expense is up approximately $160 million versus prior year. Diabetes royalties are higher due to increased sales and the transfer of future Amylin-related royalty rights, which will lead to increased royalties over the next few years.
Recall that due to the tiered structure of the agreement with AstraZeneca, the diabetes royalties are somewhat front-loaded and will decline throughout the year.
In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux were approximately $60 million and were recorded in other income.
Moving to guidance. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.20. Our new range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen and euro, we now expect the negative impact of FX on EPS to be between $0.06 and $0.08. This is approximately a $0.04 improvement since original guidance of which $0.01 has already been realized in Q1.
We raised revenue guidance due to the strong trends across the business, primarily Opdivo and Eliquis. The negative FX impact on revenues is now expected to be approximately 1%.
We are increasing our guidance on MS&A, mostly due to higher commercial spending on I-O, including additional DTC spend.
The increased investments in R&D are primarily for clinical study supplies, new BD alliances and the development of additional biomarkers and diagnostics in oncology.
Overall, a strong start to the year, which provides us with great confidence in how we see the full year.
Now, we'd be happy to address your questions."

Overall, we're feeling very good about what's happening in Europe. Our performance in Germany and France has been very good. France is hard to see because we're currently not recognizing those sales until future price negotiations, but we are doing very well across the indications that we have. If you will recall, we have our indication in metastatic melanoma, squamous lung at the beginning of our uptake curve and then recently, additional approvals coming that are yet really showing in our demand curves. We've also seen, as Giovanni mentioned, very good response to the value of Opdivo in terms of our reimbursement negotiations. Many of those negotiations and discussions with the various governments in Europe have gone quicker. So we now enjoy a good access in Germany, France as well as recently Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, we're continuing to work with. And these are relatively -- these are all broad indications, no restrictions on PD-L1 status, and we're working on additional things for the new indications in non-squamous when we have those discussions.

Now regarding CheckMate -026, we've said that both the events and the timing of follow up were important considerations for the timing of the analysis.

So let me just say, Seamus, that -- let me give you a little bit background on FRACTION. This is an innovative Phase I/Phase II design for early combination trials, and as you appreciate, we have a number of potential combinations at the moment. And this allows us to look at promising signals of activity to actually also test hypotheses about the underlying biology of combinations, and as well as checkpoints, we have a number of non-effect to mechanisms as well, and of course, to generate data to inform future combinations. So therefore, the FRACTION trial should allow us to efficiently identify the activity of promising novel combinations and quickly move them into potentially registrational trials. Now, as we've said, data from our earlier assets has started coming into house this year, and we're moving forward with the anti-LAG-3 antibody in the FRACTION study as we think there is an opportunity to improve upon Opdivo monotherapy or the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, particularly, as you say, in those patients who don't respond initially or who relapse. I think the important thing to say and to put this in the context, the broader context, is that we are very confident in our broad strategy in first line lung, and we want it to address a very broad population. Now, we clearly have emphasis on first line. We already have second line, but we do believe that the Opdivo+Yervoy regimens could further improve overall survival. And I want to note that we're  really looking forward to presenting additional data from -012 at ASCO. So overall, we wanted to show that as many lung cancer patients as possible can benefit, whether that's with monotherapy, combination Opdivo+Yervoy, exploring other combinations, which FRACTION will allow us to do more quickly and efficiently, and whether that's targeted therapies or indeed, chemotherapy. So a very broad program. Thank you."

Obviously, investors are very focused on the upcoming frontline lung studies from both Merck and you guys. Can you compare and contrast the first -- the 2 first-line monotherapy trials of Opdivo versus Keytruda since that's obviously what we're focused on? And I think that investors seem to have more confidence in the Merck trial because they are looking at the highest expressers of PD-L1 expression compared to your trial. So I think there's more confidence that they're going to hit on PFS versus Bristol-Myers. Plus, there's also worry out there about PFS being a challenging end point, just given that chemotherapy works pretty well in frontline lung. So if you can address that first. And then, secondly, a more bigger picture strategy question for the long term. Obviously, monotherapy Opdivo is doing extremely well, but as you know, doctors prefer combination therapy in treating cancer patients, and they also want to move away from chemotherapy. So can you set the stage for Opdivo combination strategies and the outlook over the next couple of years, given that a number of companies have chosen the different path which is chemo combo?"

Let me just start with your second question and give you my perspective on strategy in first-line lung cancer. Francis will add to comments and then answer specifically your questions about study design. I feel very strongly, and I am very optimistic about our strategy in first line because we obviously have a lot of experience in lung cancer through our second-line registrational strategy, which has given us not only a very broad approval, but also very clear insights into physicians' prescribing behaviors, the adoption of Opdivo, the speed at which chemotherapy has been abandoned. And while there obviously are differences between first line and second line, we really think we have developed a deep knowledge of this market, specifically as it relates to immunotherapy. So when you think about our strategy, our approach is broad and informed by science. We have, I am convinced, the right approach of investigating monotherapy, both in a broader population of PD-L1 positive patients and in a subset of patients that express PD-1 at a higher level. We have advanced a really exciting combination strategy through Study -012 and obviously the Phase III study ongoing, and we are also investigating the right combination of chemotherapy in the right patient subgroups. And so when you look at the totality of our first-line lung strategy, we believe it is the broadest approach, it is informed by data and science and a really strong understanding of market dynamics."

And we've used the results of many of our published and unpublished data to look at this and essentially, we remain very confident. We think we've got the optimal balance of speeds and design and to deliver results, not just in a narrow population but in the widest population of first-line lung patients as we've done with other studies of Opdivo recently. Just to be very specific, in the trial design, we're looking at both strongly-expressing patients and patients with any level of expression. We've not actually disclosed the actual level of what strongly-expressing PD-1 is, but it's lower than 50%. It's not clear to us that you need to have very high levels of PD-L1 expression to benefit from treatment. And if you recall the OS curves from 057, the shapes of the Kaplan-Meier curves were similar across the 1%, 5% and 10% cutoffs. So overall, everything we know has gone into this study. We're very happy with the way it's progressing. As I said, without the additional risk to the analysis, we were able to bring forward the analysis this summer, and we look forward to seeing that data then. Thanks."

Some are focused, as you know, on combinations with chemo. Others are looking at combinations for low or PD-L1 nonexpressers. We actually believe our strategy is quite differentiated, and we believe that -- I want to reemphasize this, that I-O combination, specifically Opdivo+Yervoy, is the best way to improve upon survival expectations for the patients over the long term. Now, we're very encouraged by the safety and efficacy of dosing of the regimen in non-small cell lung based on the data we presented last year at the World Lung Conference. And we're really looking forward to presenting an update of the CheckMate -012 at ASCO in June. So that will be a more mature data set and, of course, it's under embargo so I can't say anything more about it now. But we are looking forward, with that and everything else in June, to really an exciting ASCO for us because as well as the updates on existing tumors, we're going to be looking at new tumor -- effects in new tumors and data from registration studies in Hodgkin's and head and neck. So let me just finish by talking about the CheckMate 568 study. And I want to really emphasize that we have full confidence in the CheckMate -227, which is the definitive randomized registration study for first-line lung in non-small cell lung. So -- but we do, however, believe that the experience we gain from single-arm studies of combinations like 568 can help inform us about future medical practice as part of the expansive data generation strategy that you've heard from Giovanni and myself."

If the primary endpoint of PFS is strongly -- is met in the strongly expressing patients, we'll also look at all the randomized population, which includes all those that express at the greater-than-1% level. That hasn't changed either. And overall survival is a secondary endpoint and will also be analyzed as this is obviously clinically important, but I think it's worth reminding everyone that OS could be confounded by the crossover, which is allowed within this particular trial. So let me just say, nothing has changed in terms of the analysis. What we're able to do as we've watched the drug -- I'm sorry, as we watch the study mature in terms of the duration of therapy and the event rate is that we were able to advance it forward without any increased risk to the study. Now, just a quick note on FRACTION. FRACTION is a study that gives us enormous flexibility. So you've picked up on an interesting point. There are a lot of patients in this, but it allows us, depending on the data, to move to additional arms or to ramp up in the arms there. So it's not the same as you would expect for a registrational study where you come up with the number at the beginning. It's about efficiency. It's about speed. It's about being able to identify signals and move quickly should we see them. Thank you very much."

As far as LAG-3, I think as I've already said, I was -- and I appreciate how closely people look at the ClinicalTrials.gov data, but particularly in the FRACTION context, particularly these adaptable and flexible trials, some of the changes, even quite large changes in number of people and duration, don't necessarily correlate with how the drug is and isn't going.

My perspective is that, that really puts into context our strategy with novel agents where we've consistently said that we're looking at really understanding the basis for patients that don't respond or progress following the response. I think FRACTION, as Francis mentioned, is a great trial for us to test hypotheses in advance at an early pipeline very strategically. It also underlines the importance of the breadth of our early pipeline with up to 8 agents in early clinical development this year. And obviously, we're also investigating what happens in terms of retreatment potential and other evolution in how the sequence of care in lung cancer happens. That really positions us very strongly because of the totality of what we have going. Murdo?"

So while we're focused on I-O or I-O combinations, we're certainly open to the idea of chemo in certain patient segments. I think as far as the small cell lung cancer, which you intimated from your question about TL04, chemotherapy there has an important role to play and TL04 is -- the target is one way of addressing that with an ADC.

We just finished another very good quarter. Sales across key markets and key brands were strong. We had important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio and an exciting ASCO. 
We've entered the period of growth I've discussed before, with 17% sales growth in the second quarter compared to last year. In fact, sales growth was 24%, excluding the impact from Abilify and Herbatox. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our EPS of $0.69 represents a growth of 30% versus last year. 
I will share a few of our highlights and Charlie will then provide more details. 
Starting with Eliquis, global sales grew 78% from a year ago as we continued to make progress towards our goal of becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant. 
In the U.S., the second quarter continued the trend of strong Eliquis performance. On both AFib and B2E, Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in total prescriptions among cardiologists and new-to-brand prescriptions across both divisions. 
Outside the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions in Japan and the #1 NOAC in cardiology across a growing number of markets.  We continue to see strong demand trends from key markets across the globe. 
At the upcoming ESC Congress in August, we will be presenting additional real world data supporting the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus other NOACs. 
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've made great progress in transforming the cancer care with more than 80 global approvals around the world, including 9 approved indications in the U.S. in less than 2 years. I'm very proud of our accomplishments, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading them in oncology agent, one that is foundational and the standard of care within its approved indications. 
We continue to see strong execution from our R&D and commercial organizations. During the quarter, we saw strong sales performance for both Opdivo and Yervoy with Opdivo growing 19% worldwide quarter-over-quarter. 
In the U.S., Opdivo sales were led by lung and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, Yervoy grew 32% versus last year as the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen became the single most prescribed therapy in first line metastatic melanoma in the U.S. 
In Germany, we have seen strong update in first line melanoma and second line non-small-cell lung cancer. 
In France, we have approximately 80% of the [indiscernible] market. We're not yet recording revenues there as formal reimbursement has not been obtained and we are operating under an ADU. 
In Japan, Opdivo became the largest oncology brand in June. 
With respect to R&D, Opdivo is now approved in 54 markets worldwide and we made some excellent progress in the second quarter. 
In the EU, Opdivo was approved for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and receive expanded approvals for use in pretreated renal patients as well as broad use in pretreated non-squamous lung patients. 
The FDA granted a sixth breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for the potential use in previously treated patients with unresectable bladder cancer. 
And just last week, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency validated applications for the use of Opdivo in the treatment of head and neck cancer. 
ASCO was a very important meeting for us. We presented broad data across 13 types of cancer, reinforcing our commitment to addressing significant unmet needs in a wide range of tumors. 
In first line, non-small cell lung cancer, we presented unprecedented data from CheckMate -012, which strengthened our confidence that the I-O combination of Opdivo + Yervoy may improve upon long-term survival expectations for patients who express PD-L1. 
In other tumors such as small cell lung cancer and MSI high metastatic colorectal cancer, we presented encouraging data, which has the potential to broaden the benefit of Opdivo + Yervoy. 
And we presented encouraging new data in bladder and more mature data in hepatocellular carcinoma, which speaks to the depth and breadth of our clinical program as we establish the promise of I-O in additional tumor types. 
I am confident we are making all of the right investments from both an R&D and a commercial perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position. 
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie, I want to highlight some news we shared earlier this week. Many of you know Fouad Namouni as he has played a critical role in our immuno-oncology strategy so far. Fouad has been appointed to head our oncology development reporting directly to Francis. 
In his new role, Fouad will focus on our comprehensive portfolio strategy for oncology and on driving product development plans from the early development stage to commercialization. 
We also announced that after more than 17 years, Michael Giordano will be retiring from Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
I want to personally thank Michael for his many contributions since joining the company. Michael and his teams have led the development and approval of more than a dozen medicines, marking a successful drug development carrier. 
Now looking ahead, I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. We have a significant opportunity for growth, driven primarily by Opdivo and Eliquis between now and 2020 and an exciting early portfolio of medicines with the potential to drive growth well beyond 2020. 
Now, I'll turn the floor over to Charlie for additional comments. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter, driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02. Le",718,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter, driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year. 
Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02. 
Let me start with a few additional comments on our sales performance. As Giovanni mentioned, Eliquis continues to be very well with Q2 sales of $777 million. We continue to see strong TRx growth trends quarter-on-quarter, some of which was offset by the work done in the quarter from the Q1 inventory building the channel as well as the higher Q2 Medicare liability. 
Opdivo has become a foundational immuno-oncology agent, and that is reflective in its continued strong performance. Physician adoption of Opdivo remains strong in markets where we have launched and have reimbursement, with PD-1 shares of approximately 80% in the U.S. and in key national market. With approvals now in 54 markets, international sales for Opdivo moved to $197 million in the quarter. 
Sales in the U.S. grew 8% sequentially over first quarter, driven by strong demand growth, which was partially offset by wholesale inventory movement of approximately $45 million. 
Yervoy sales were down 19% versus last year, driven mainly by pressure nationally from the launch of PD-1 agent. 
In the U.S., Yervoy was up 32% compared to last year, driven by regimen use. We expect pressure to continue internationally until we secure reimbursement over the next year, following our approval of the regimen in Europe for metastatic melanoma. 
Daklinza had another good quarter with sales driven mainly by strong demand in the U.S. and Europe in the genotype 3 patient population. We expect the competition from recently approved therapies will significantly impact the U.S. business in the second half of this year. 
In Europe, we also expect significant impact once [indiscernible] is secured. 
empliciti sales in the U.S. were $33 million as we continue to focus on gaining new trial and driving demand in very competitive relapsed refractory market. 
Now on to our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.3% during the quarter, down 100 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is primarily due to profit mix, including the strong performance of Eliquis in the U.S. Abilify contract expiration. 
MS&A was up 9% versus last year, driven by our investments behind new brands, including Opdivo, Eliquis and Empliciti. This was partially offset by lower spend on established products. 
R&D expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter, the increase in spending was primarily due to grants, Opdivo study supplies and other immuno-oncology investment. 
Other income was approximately $90 million up versus prior year, which benefited from royalties we now receive on Erbitux, R&D expense reimbursements from our deal with Bev and higher diabetes royalty. This was partially offset by the write-down of our [indiscernible] equity investment of $45 million. 
As I mentioned last quarter, diabetes royalties are higher in the first half of the year due to the appearing structure of our agreement with A&D. We, therefore, expect overall OI&E to be slightly lower in the second half of the year. 
Though this development remains a key priority and a strategic source for our company, during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals and their novel antibody program, targeting IL-8 as well as 4 clinical collaborations that support our combination strategy for immuno-oncology. 
Switching to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.55 to $2.65. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakened against the yen, we now expect the impact of foreign exchange on EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07. 
I know our MS&A expense was higher than many of you expected during the quarter. This is from early due to the timing of investments behind Opdivo, and we still expect MS&A to decrease in the low single digit range. We now expect R&D spend to increase in the mid-teens range, driven by investments in Opdivo and other immuno-oncology programs. This also accounts for the increased spending related to business development transaction completed this year. 
The effective tax rate is now expected to be 22%. 
As a Giovanni mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong performance across the entirety of our company, and now look forward to your questions."

So we don't believe that will be an impact on the way we've done our study here. Talking about CRC. We're focused on diversifying across the full range of differentiated mechanisms of actions in evaluating different combinations with I-O. Based on those where we have biological rationale, in particular, tumors -- and particularly where we have not seen sufficient activity with Opdivo or monotherapy or Opdivo+Yervoy  regimen and that would include colorectal cancer. Now as you said, [indiscernible] presented Phase I data in combination PD-L1 in combination with the [indiscernible] inhibitor. And I agree. While the data was early and the size of study was small, the combination did show activity. We continue to look for combinations, both externally or internally with our several early-stage assets, which would help us to identify patient populations and mechanisms and study CRC is a focus for that. I would just comment that we presented in the MSI non-stable in the MSI high patient population very interesting data, not just monotherapy but combination at ASCO. And so there are some parts of CRC where we think our regimen will have an effect."

And another question on those topic is most likely venue? And last question, has to do with the cut off. You haven't been willing to rebuild that in the past. I'm wondering why. I understand it's a 5% cut off. I think the market seems 10%. I'm wondering if you're kind of keeping that close to the best to allow you the flexibility to actually change that cutoff point before database lock."

As far as chemo 24 is concerned, it's hard to make comment without having the trial design and the development details in terms of crossover. Just to remind you, both studies allow for PD-1 therapy after the progression on chemo. And we're not actually aware of technical differences that will create on the crossover. Now, as you know, there's always a possibility that OS may be confounded in an open trial, and that's why we paid a lot of attention to the timing of the analysis. I mentioned that over the last few months. We also made sure that the CheckMate -026 post-call that the patients on chemo were required actually to have their progression confirmed centrally before they are allowed to receive Opdivo. That's important because that reduce the amount of  [indiscernible] around that. So again, we think it's always an issue, but I think we minimized that in terms of getting potential results, both in terms of PFS and of course, OS. We will, as usual, be looking for the earliest opportunity to present the data at a conference and publish it, and I'll say, again, we're not going to talk about the high expresses cutoff at this point. But you, obviously, will have an opportunity to see that when we talk about the data. Thanks very much."

I would go back to what we said a few minutes ago at the beginning. Our experience is that given strong data and significant patient value, payers are providing access to combo regimens in I-O. And when you look at the evolution of combination regimens depending on the dose of different agents and the frequency of those, the incremental cost to payers is very sustainable. Because when you look at our regimen in melanoma, for example, during the phase of induction, which is the 12 weeks in which 2 products are used together about, the cost of induction is only 6% higher than monotherapy. And then when you look at the regimen that we are taking into -227 of lung cancer, there is a lower dose of Yervoy, which is administered every 6 weeks. So all of that to say that at this point, we continue to think about the regimen that has the strongest data in the label and offers the most value to patients and the one that is reimbursed and one that is reimbursed by payers and adopted in the marketplace."

We just finished another very good quarter. Sales across key markets and key brands were strong. We had important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio and an exciting ASCO.
We've entered the period of growth I've discussed before with 17% sales growth in the second quarter compared to last year. In fact, sales growth was 24%, excluding the impact from Abilify and Erbitux.
On a non-GAAP basis, our EPS of $0.69 represents a growth of 30% versus last year.
I will share a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details.
Starting with Eliquis, global sales grew 78% from a year ago as we continued to make progress towards our goal of becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant.
In the U.S., the second quarter continued the trend of strong Eliquis' performance. Our both AFib and BTE, Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in total prescriptions among cardiologists and new-to-brand prescriptions across all physicians.
Outside the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions in Japan and the #1 NOAC in cardiology across a growing number of markets.  We continue to see strong demand trends from key markets across the globe.
At the upcoming ESC Congress in August, we will be presenting additional real world data supporting the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus other NOACs.
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've made great progress in transforming cancer care with more than 80 global approvals around the world, including 9 approved indications in the U.S. in less than 2 years. I am very proud of our accomplishments, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational in a standard of care within its approved indications.
We continue to see strong execution from our R&D and commercial organizations. During the quarter, we saw strong sales performance for both Opdivo and Yervoy with Opdivo growing 19% worldwide quarter-over-quarter.
In the U.S., Opdivo sales were led by lung and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, Yervoy grew 32% versus last year as the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen became the single most prescribed therapy in first-line metastatic melanoma in the U.S.
In Germany, we have seen strong update in first-line melanoma and second-line non-small cell lung cancer.
In France, we have approximately 80% of the PD-1 market. We're not yet recording revenues there as formal reimbursement has not been obtained, and we are operating under an ATU [ph].
In Japan, Opdivo became the largest oncology brand in June.
With respect to R&D, Opdivo is now approved in 54 markets worldwide, and we made some excellent progress in the second quarter.
In the EU, Opdivo was approved for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and received expanded approvals for use in pretreated renal patients as well as broad use in pretreated non-squamous lung patients.
The FDA granted a sixth breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for the potential use in previously treated patients with unresectable bladder cancer.
And just last week, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency validated applications for the use of Opdivo in the treatment of head and neck cancer.
ASCO was a very important meeting for us. We presented broad data across 13 types of cancers, reinforcing our commitment to addressing significant unmet needs in a wide range of tumors.
In first-line non-small cell lung cancer, we presented unprecedented data from CheckMate -012, which strengthened our confidence that the I-O combination of Opdivo+Yervoy may improve upon long-term survival expectations for patients who express PD-L1.
In other tumors such as small cell lung cancer and MSI-high metastatic colorectal cancer, we presented encouraging data which has the potential to broaden the benefit of Opdivo+Yervoy.
And we presented encouraging new data in bladder and more mature data in hepatocellular carcinoma which speaks to the depth and breadth of our clinical program as we establish the promise of I-O in additional tumor types.
I am confident we are making all of the right investments from, both an R&D and a commercial perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie, I want to highlight some news we shared earlier this week. Many of you know Fouad Namouni as he has played a critical role in our immuno-oncology strategy so far. Fouad has been appointed Head of Oncology Development, reporting directly to Francis.
In his new role, Fouad will focus on our comprehensive portfolio strategy for oncology and on driving product development plans from the early development stage to commercialization.
We also announced that after more than 17 years, Michael Giordano will be retiring from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
I want to personally thank Michael for his many contributions since joining the company. Michael and his teams have led the development and approval of more than a dozen medicines marking a successful drug development carrier.
Now looking ahead, I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. We have a significant opportunity for growth, driven primarily by Opdivo and Eliquis between now and 2020 and an exciting early portfolio of medicines with the potential to drive growth well beyond 2020.
Now I'll turn the floor over to Charlie for additional comments. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year.
Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02.
Let me start with a few additional comments on our sales performance. As Giovanni mentioned, Eliquis continues to be very well with Q2 sales of $777 million. We continued to see strong TRx growth trends quarter-on-quarter, some of which was offset by the work done in the quarter from the Q1 inventory building the channel as well as the higher Q2 Medicare liability.
Opdivo has become a foundational immuno-oncology agent, and that is reflective in its continued strong performance. Physician adoption of Opdivo remained strong in markets that we have launched and have reimbursement with PD-1 shares of approximately 80% in the U.S. and in key international market. With approvals now in 54 markets, international sales for Opdivo grew to $197 million in the quarter.
Sales in the U.S. grew 8% sequentially over fourth -- first quarter, driven by strong demand growth, which was partially offset by wholesaler inventory movement of approximately $45 million.
Yervoy sales were down 19% versus last year, driven mainly by pressure internationally from the launch of PD-1 agent.
In the U.S., Yervoy was up 32% compared to last year, driven by regimen use. We expect pressure to continue internationally until we secure reimbursement over the next year following our approval of the regimen in Europe for metastatic melanoma.
Daklinza had another good quarter with sales driven mainly by strong demand in the U.S. and Europe in the genotype 3 patient population. We expect the competition from recently approved therapies will significantly impact the U.S. business in the second half of this year.
In Europe, we also expect significant impact once access is secured. 
Empliciti sales in the U.S. were $33 million as we continue to focus on gaining new trial and driving demand in very competitive relapsed/refractory market. 
Now I move to our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.3% during the quarter, down 100 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is primarily due to profit mix, including the strong performance of Eliquis and the U.S. Abilify contract expiration.
MS&A was up 9% versus last year, driven by our investments behind new brands, including Opdivo, Eliquis and Empliciti. This was partially offset by lower spend on established products.
R&D expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter. The increase in spending was primarily due to grants, Opdivo study supplies and other immuno-oncology investments.
Other income was approximately $90 million up versus prior year, which benefited from royalties we now receive on Erbitux, R&D expense reimbursements from our deal with Bev [ph] and higher diabetes royalty. This was partially offset by the write-down of our uniQure equity investment of $45 million.
As I mentioned last quarter, diabetes royalties are higher in the first half of the year due to the tearing structure of our agreement with AUD. We therefore expect overall OI&E [ph] to be slightly lower in the second half of the year.
Business development remains a key priority and a strategic source of innovation for our company. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals and their novel antibody program targeting IL-8 as well as 4 clinical collaborations that support our combination strategy for immuno-oncology.
Switching to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.55 to $2.65. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen, we now expect the impact of foreign exchange on EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07.
I know our MS&A expense was higher than many of you expected during the quarter. This was primarily due to the timing of investments behind Opdivo, and we still expect MS&A to decrease in the low-single-digit range. We now expect R&D spend to increase in the mid-teens range, driven by investments in Opdivo and other immuno-oncology programs. This also accounts for the increased spending related to business development transactions completed this year.
The effective tax rate is now expected to be 22%. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong performance across the entirety of our company and now look forward to your questions."

Thinking about your CheckMate-227 trial, how do we think about that within the context of PSS as a primary endpoint. Obviously, the Merck data is supported in this indication, but here we have the potential increased risk of pseudoprogression, again, just focusing on PSS. And then finally, there was some provocative data from one of your competitors in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer, non-MSI patients combining a MEK and PD-L1 agent. I think you're the only major PDX sponsor that doesn't have a MEK inhibitor in your portfolio.

And while we don't have an exact time line with respect to the publication of a potential final rule, obviously, that is what we are waiting for. I would say that what many stakeholders really have been concerned about if the possibility the changes that are suddenly introduced in the reimbursement mechanism for Part B products may have an impact in where patients are treated and lead to a reduced capacity to treat patients in the community, which obviously, will not be good for patients and would create significant burden for hospitals. And so that is one of the elements we will be looking for because obviously it's critically important for patients. With respect to the rule becoming involuntary, that we will have to see. Clearly, it is the timing which there are multiple other pilots in the market and therefore, a voluntary rule may enable physicians to participate in one pilot and not have a very complex set of schemes they have to operate under at the same time. So I would leave it at that."

As you correctly note, pseudoprogression was an issue in the early days of I-O with Yervoy but because we've generated a lot of data now with Yervoy monotherapy and, of course, with the combination.

So we don't believe there will be an impact on the way we've done our study here. Talking about CRC, we've focused on diversifying across a very broad range of differentiated mechanisms of actions in evaluating different combinations with I-O. Based on those where we have a biological rationale, in particular, tumors and particularly where we're not seeing sufficient activity with Opdivo monotherapy or Opdivo+Yervoy regimen and that would include colorectal cancer. Now as you said, Roche presented Phase I data in combination of PD-L1 in combination with the MEK inhibitor. And I agree. While the data was early and the size of study was small, the combination did appear to show activity. We continue to look for combinations both externally or internally with our several early-stage assets, which would help us to identify patient populations and mechanisms and certainly CRC is a focus for that. I would just comment that we presented in the non-stable MSI in the MSI-high patient population very interesting data, not just monotherapy, but combination at ASCO. And so there are some parts of CRC where we think our regimen will have an effect."

Now the selected population of high expressers is not 50%.  So we should be able to describe the effect at 50% cut-off once our analysis is complete. And just to finish, as I've noted in the past and I'll note again today, I'm confident in the study design of -026 and I look forward to seeing the data in weeks, not months."

So we're very optimistic about that.

And I think that will be really important point for us going forward because in lung cancer, Opdivo clearly has become the foundational therapy. We're also very pleased that we are seeing similar dynamics happen in every international market in which we have obtained reimbursement and loan chain. And overall, we continue to maintain a very high percentage of total PD-1 sales in the 80% range. As we think about our lung cancer strategy going into first line, as Francis mentioned, we are very confident in our understanding of the disease off Opdivo and in the design of the clinical trial. And overall, I would say, in the long term, we're also very comfortable with our strategy that has a really strong pillar in monotherapy, but then over the next year or so, we'll transition into the potential use of the combination therapy. So we feel we are very strongly positioned in first line today, and we have a really solid strategy for maintaining that leadership position going forward as immunotherapy moves into the first line setting. We will have to look at the study once we obtain the results of the study to really understand the data. And as Francis said, we are weeks away, we're not months away.

As far as Keynote-024 is concerned, it's hard for me to comment without having the trial design and the enrollment details in terms of the crossover. Just to remind you, both studies allowed for PD-1 therapy after the progression on chemo. And we're not actually aware any technical differences that will create a difference in the crossover. Now, as you know, there's always a possibility that OS may be confounded in an open trial. And that's why we paid a lot of attention to the timing of the analysis. I mentioned that over the last few months. We also made sure that the CheckMate -026 protocol that the patients on chemo were required actually to have their progression confirmed centrally before they were allowed to receive Opdivo. That's important because that reduce the amounts of wobble around that. So again, we think it's always an issue, but we think we've minimized that in terms of getting a potential result, both in terms of PFS and, of course, OS.

First, I would say, we're very pleased with the potential of Opdivo and Yervoy, and it's clearly at this point the only combination regimen that has demonstrated significant efficacy and acceptable safety profile. We started that work in melanoma. We're clearly in R&D expanded and progressed that work very significantly in lung cancer. I believe that the doubling of response across all levels of PD-1 expression versus Opdivo monotherapy in lung cancer is studied well was extremely promising. And we're also challenging ourselves, and we have challenged ourselves to find the regimens that are tolerable, which we believe we have with the new regimen in lung. At the same time, we are taking this combination regimen to many more tumor types, and the data continues to be extremely promising. So it's really not a dogma, but in reality, it is a proven mechanism of treatment of patients that is demonstrating clinical trial -- other clinical trials to really have big role to play. As Francis said, our objective is, at the same time, to continue to accelerate new mechanisms of action into the clinic. That's why we have 8 immuno-oncology agents into early development, and we will continue to work to raise the bar beyond what we think is already a very important accomplishment with Opdivo and Yervoy."

We've entered the period of growth I've discussed before with 17% sales growth in the second quarter compared to last year. In fact, sales growth was 24%, excluding the impact from Abilify and Erbitux.
On a non-GAAP basis, our EPS of $0.69 represents a growth of 30% versus last year.
I will share a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details.
Starting with Eliquis, global sales grew 78% from a year ago as we continued to make progress towards our goal of becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant.
In the U.S., the second quarter continued the trend of strong Eliquis' performance. Our both AFib and BTE, Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in total prescriptions among cardiologists and new-to-brand prescriptions across all physicians.
Outside the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions in Japan and the #1 NOAC in cardiology across a growing number of markets.  We continue to see strong demand trends from key markets across the globe.
At the upcoming ESC Congress in August, we will be presenting additional real world data supporting the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus other NOACs.
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've made great progress in transforming cancer care with more than 80 global approvals around the world, including 9 approved indications in the U.S. in less than 2 years. I am very proud of our accomplishments, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational in a standard of care within its approved indications.
We continue to see strong execution from our R&D and commercial organizations. During the quarter, we saw strong sales performance for both Opdivo and Yervoy with Opdivo growing 19% worldwide quarter-over-quarter.
In the U.S., Opdivo sales were led by lung and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, Yervoy grew 32% versus last year as the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen became the single most prescribed therapy in first-line metastatic melanoma in the U.S.
In Germany, we have seen strong uptake in first-line melanoma and second-line non-small cell lung cancer.
In France, we have approximately 80% of the PD-1 market. We're not yet recording revenues there as formal reimbursement has not been obtained, and we are operating under an ATU [ph].
In Japan, Opdivo became the largest oncology brand in June.
With respect to R&D, Opdivo is now approved in 54 markets worldwide, and we made some excellent progress in the second quarter.
In the EU, Opdivo was approved for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and received expanded approvals for use in pretreated renal patients as well as broad use in pretreated non-squamous lung patients.
The FDA granted a sixth breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for the potential use in previously treated patients with unresectable bladder cancer.
And just last week, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency validated applications for the use of Opdivo in the treatment of head and neck cancer.
ASCO was a very important meeting for us. We presented broad data across 13 types of cancers, reinforcing our commitment to addressing significant unmet needs in a wide range of tumors.
In first-line non-small cell lung cancer, we presented unprecedented data from CheckMate -012, which strengthened our confidence that the I-O combination of Opdivo+Yervoy may improve upon long-term survival expectations for patients who express PD-L1.
In other tumors such as small cell lung cancer and MSI-high metastatic colorectal cancer, we presented encouraging data which has the potential to broaden the benefit of Opdivo+Yervoy.
And we presented encouraging new data in bladder and more mature data in hepatocellular carcinoma which speaks to the depth and breadth of our clinical program as we establish the promise of I-O in additional tumor types.
I am confident we are making all of the right investments from, both an R&D and a commercial perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie, I want to highlight some news we shared earlier this week. Many of you know Fouad Namouni as he has played a critical role in our immuno-oncology strategy so far. Fouad has been appointed Head of Oncology Development, reporting directly to Francis.
In his new role, Fouad will focus on our comprehensive portfolio strategy for oncology and on driving product development plans from the early development stage to commercialization.
We also announced that after more than 17 years, Michael Giordano will be retiring from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
I want to personally thank Michael for his many contributions since joining the company. Michael and his teams have led the development and approval of more than a dozen medicines marking a successful drug development career.
Now looking ahead, I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. We have a significant opportunity for growth, driven primarily by Opdivo and Eliquis between now and 2020 and an exciting early portfolio of medicines with the potential to drive growth well beyond 2020.
Now I'll turn the floor over to Charlie for additional comments. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year.
Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02.
Let me start with a few additional comments on our sales performance. As Giovanni mentioned, Eliquis continues to do very well with Q2 sales of $777 million. We continued to see strong TRx growth trends quarter-on-quarter, some of which was offset by the work done in the quarter from the Q1 inventory building the channel as well as the higher Q2 Medicare liability.
Opdivo has become a foundational immuno-oncology agent, and that is reflective in its continued strong performance. Physician adoption of Opdivo remained strong in markets that we have launched and have reimbursement with PD-1 shares of approximately 80% in the U.S. and in key international markets. With approvals now in 54 markets, international sales for Opdivo grew to $197 million in the quarter.
Sales in the U.S. grew 8% sequentially over fourth -- first quarter, driven by strong demand growth, which was partially offset by wholesaler inventory movements of approximately $45 million.
Yervoy sales were down 19% versus last year, driven mainly by pressure internationally from the launch of PD-1 agent.
In the U.S., Yervoy was up 32% compared to last year, driven by regimen use. We expect pressure to continue internationally until we secure reimbursement over the next year following our approval of the regimen in Europe for metastatic melanoma.
Daklinza had another good quarter with sales driven mainly by strong demand in the U.S. and Europe in the genotype 3 patient population. We expect that competition from recently approved therapies will significantly impact the U.S. business in the second half of this year.
In Europe, we also expect significant impact once access is secured. 
Empliciti sales in the U.S. were $33 million as we continue to focus on gaining new trial and driving demand in very competitive relapsed/refractory market. 
Now I move to our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.3% during the quarter, down 100 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is primarily due to profit mix, including the strong performance of Eliquis and the U.S. Abilify contract expiration.
MS&A was up 9% versus last year, driven by our investments behind new brands, including Opdivo, Eliquis and Empliciti. This was partially offset by lower spend on established products.
R&D expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter. The increase in spending was primarily due to grants, Opdivo study supplies and other immuno-oncology investments.
Other income was approximately $90 million up versus prior year, which benefited from royalties we now receive on Erbitux, R&D expense reimbursements from our deal with Bev [ph] and higher diabetes royalties. This was partially offset by the write-down of our uniQure equity investment of $45 million.
As I mentioned last quarter, diabetes royalties are higher in the first half of the year due to the tiering structure of our agreement with AUD. We therefore expect overall OI&E to be slightly lower in the second half of the year.
Business development remains a key priority and a strategic source of innovation for our company. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals and their novel antibody program targeting IL-8 as well as 4 clinical collaborations that support our combination strategy for immuno-oncology.
Switching to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.55 to $2.65. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen, we now expect the impact of foreign exchange on EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07.
I know our MS&A expense was higher than many of you expected during the quarter. This was primarily due to the timing of investments behind Opdivo, and we still expect MS&A to decrease in the low-single-digit range. We now expect R&D spend to increase in the mid-teens range, driven by investments in Opdivo and other immuno-oncology programs. This also accounts for the increased spending related to business development transactions completed this year.
The effective tax rate is now expected to be 22%. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong performance across the entirety of our company and now look forward to your questions."

Second, CTLA-4 seems to be associated with more late response and pseudoprogression that perhaps you see with PD-1. Thinking about your CheckMate-227 trial, how do we think about that within the context of PSS as a primary endpoint. Obviously, the Merck data is supported in this indication, but here we have the potential increased risk of pseudoprogression, again, just focusing on PSS. And then finally, there was some provocative data from one of your competitors in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer, non-MSI patients combining a MEK and PD-L1 agent. I think you're the only major PDX sponsor that doesn't have a MEK inhibitor in your portfolio. I understand there's a lot of opportunities, but is this now of interest and are you pursuing such combination with a MEK?"

And while we don't have an exact time line with respect to the publication of a potential final rule, obviously, that is what we are waiting for. I would say that what many stakeholders really have been concerned about is the possibility that changes that are suddenly introduced in the reimbursement mechanism for Part B products may have an impact in where patients are treated and lead to a reduced capacity to treat patients in the community, which obviously, will not be good for patients and would create significant burden for hospitals. And so that is one of the elements we will be looking for because obviously it's critically important for patients. With respect to the rule becoming voluntary, that we will have to see. Clearly, it is the timing which there are multiple other pilots in the market and therefore, a voluntary rule may enable physicians to participate in one pilot and not have a very complex set of schemes they have to operate under at the same time. So I would leave it at that."

So we don't believe there will be an impact on the way we've done our study here. Talking about CRC, we've focused on diversifying across a very broad range of differentiated mechanisms of actions in evaluating different combinations with I-O. Based on those where we have a biological rationale, in particular, tumors and particularly where we're not seeing sufficient activity with Opdivo monotherapy or Opdivo+Yervoy regimen and that would include colorectal cancer. Now as you said, Roche presented Phase I data in combination of PD-L1 in combination with the MEK inhibitor. And I agree. While the data was early and the size of study was small, the combination did appear to show activity. We continue to look for combinations both externally or internally with our several early-stage assets, which would help us to identify patient populations and mechanisms and certainly CRC is a focus for that. I would just comment that we presented in the non-stable MSI in the MSI-high patient population very interesting data, not just monotherapy, but combination at ASCO. And so there are some parts of CRC where we think our regimen will have an effect."

If we hit PFS that is greater than 1%, we can then test for OS in both strongly expressing and greater than 1%. Now just to remind you, overall survival is a secondary endpoint in CheckMate -026, and we still can still file without a positive OS result. Now the selected population of high expressers is not 50%.  So we should be able to describe the effect at 50% cut-off once our analysis is complete.

And given the size of this market, it takes some time for a new focused patient type to really take hold in the marketplace. And I can see now across the world, emerging strengthening trends in ORENCIA. In the U.S., in particular, we're seeing very good evolution of our subcu formulation of the product. And in major markets across Europe, we also see good acceleration of the subcu performance. We have an additional catalyst for growth in Europe with new labeling that allows ORENCIA to be promoted for methotrexate-naive patients with moderate progressive disease. So that also presents an opportunity in the later half of that year."

As far as Keynote-024 is concerned, it's hard for me to comment without having the trial design and the enrollment details in terms of the crossover. Just to remind you, both studies allowed for PD-1 therapy after progression on chemo. And we're not actually aware any technical differences that will create a difference in the crossover. Now, as you know, there's always a possibility that OS may be confounded in an open trial. And that's why we paid a lot of attention to the timing of the analysis. I mentioned that over the last few months. We also made sure that the CheckMate -026 protocol that the patients on chemo were required actually to have their progression confirmed centrally before they were allowed to receive Opdivo. That's important because that reduce the amounts of wobble around that. So again, we think it's always an issue, but we think we've minimized that in terms of getting a potential result, both in terms of PFS and, of course, OS. We will, as usual, be looking for the earliest opportunity to present the data at a conference and publish it. As -- and I'll say again, we're not going to talk about the high expresser cutoff at this point. But you, obviously, will have an opportunity to see that when we talk about the data.

I would go back to what we said a few minutes ago at the beginning. Our experience is that given strong data and significant patient value, payers are providing access to combo regimens in I-O. And when you look at the evolution of combination regimens depending on the dose of different agents and the frequency of those, the incremental cost to payers is very sustainable. Because when you look at our regimen in melanoma, for example, during the phase of induction, which is the 12 weeks in which 2 products are used together, the cost of induction is only 6% higher than monotherapy. And then when you look at the regimen that we are taking into -227 of lung cancer, there is a lower dose of Yervoy, which is administered every 6 weeks. So all of that to say that at this point, we continue to think about the regimen that has the strongest data in the label and offers the most value to patients and the one that is reimbursed and one that is reimbursed by payers and adopted in the marketplace."

We started that work in melanoma. We're clearly in R&D expanded and progressed that work very significantly in lung cancer. I believe that the doubling of response across all levels of PD-1 expression versus Opdivo monotherapy in lung cancer is studied well and was extremely promising. And we're also challenging ourselves, and we have challenged ourselves to find the regimens that are tolerable, which we believe we have with the new regimen in lung. At the same time, we are taking this combination regimen to many more tumor types, and the data continues to be extremely promising. So it's really not a dogma, but in reality, it is a proven mechanism of treatment of patients that is demonstrating clinical trial -- other clinical trials to really have big role to play.

And you basically said, ""Look, I don't -- what I remember is you basically said, ""Look, these trials, we think, they're designed well. We don't think they're risky."" I'm just wondering if your confidence level in -026 is similar for the all comer population to that. And then also, do you have any information on second line duration?"

We just finished another very good quarter. Sales across key markets and key brands were strong. We had important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio and an exciting ASCO.
We've entered the period of growth I've discussed before with 17% sales growth in the second quarter compared to last year. In fact, sales growth was 24%, excluding the impact from Abilify and Erbitux.
On a non-GAAP basis, our EPS of $0.69 represents a growth of 30% versus last year.
I will share a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details.
Starting with Eliquis, global sales grew 78% from a year ago as we continued to make progress towards our goal of becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant.
In the U.S., the second quarter continued the trend of strong Eliquis' performance. Our both AFib and BTE, Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in total prescriptions among cardiologists and new-to-brand prescriptions across all physicians.
Outside the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions in Japan and the #1 NOAC in cardiology across a growing number of markets.  We continue to see strong demand trends from key markets across the globe.
At the upcoming ESC Congress in August, we will be presenting additional real world data supporting the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus other NOACs.
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've made great progress in transforming cancer care with more than 80 global approvals around the world, including 9 approved indications in the U.S. in less than 2 years. I am very proud of our accomplishments, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational in a standard of care within its approved indications.
We continue to see strong execution from our R&D and commercial organizations. During the quarter, we saw strong sales performance for both Opdivo and Yervoy with Opdivo growing 19% worldwide quarter-over-quarter.
In the U.S., Opdivo sales were led by lung and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, Yervoy grew 32% versus last year as the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen became the single most prescribed therapy in first-line metastatic melanoma in the U.S.
In Germany, we have seen strong uptake in first-line melanoma and second-line non-small cell lung cancer.
In France, we have approximately 80% of the PD-1 market. We're not yet recording revenues there as formal reimbursement has not been obtained, and we are operating under an ATU [ph].
In Japan, Opdivo became the largest oncology brand in June.
With respect to R&D, Opdivo is now approved in 54 markets worldwide, and we made some excellent progress in the second quarter.
In the EU, Opdivo was approved for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and received expanded approvals for use in pretreated renal patients as well as broad use in pretreated non-squamous lung patients.
The FDA granted a sixth breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for the potential use in previously treated patients with unresectable bladder cancer.
And just last week, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency validated applications for the use of Opdivo in the treatment of head and neck cancer.
ASCO was a very important meeting for us. We presented broad data across 13 types of cancers, reinforcing our commitment to addressing significant unmet needs in a wide range of tumors.
In first-line non-small cell lung cancer, we presented unprecedented data from CheckMate -012, which strengthened our confidence that the I-O combination of Opdivo+Yervoy may improve upon long-term survival expectations for patients who express PD-L1.
In other tumors such as small cell lung cancer and MSI-high metastatic colorectal cancer, we presented encouraging data which has the potential to broaden the benefit of Opdivo+Yervoy.
And we presented encouraging new data in bladder and more mature data in hepatocellular carcinoma which speaks to the depth and breadth of our clinical program as we establish the promise of I-O in additional tumor types.
I am confident we are making all of the right investments from, both an R&D and a commercial perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie, I want to highlight some news we shared earlier this week. Many of you know Fouad Namouni as he has played a critical role in our immuno-oncology strategy so far. Fouad has been appointed Head of Oncology Development, reporting directly to Francis.
In his new role, Fouad will focus on our comprehensive portfolio strategy for oncology and on driving product development plans from the early development stage to commercialization.
We also announced that after more than 17 years, Michael Giordano will be retiring from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
I want to personally thank Michael for his many contributions since joining the company. Michael and his teams have led the development and approval of more than a dozen medicines marking a successful drug development career.
Now looking ahead, I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. We have a significant opportunity for growth, driven primarily by Opdivo and Eliquis between now and 2020 and an exciting early portfolio of medicines with the potential to drive growth well beyond 2020.
Now I'll turn the floor over to Charlie for additional comments. Thank you."

We had a very good quarter driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year.Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02.Let m",718,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year.
Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02.
Let me start with a few additional comments on our sales performance. As Giovanni mentioned, Eliquis continues to do very well with Q2 sales of $777 million. We continued to see strong TRx growth trends quarter-on-quarter, some of which was offset by the work done in the quarter from the Q1 inventory building the channel as well as the higher Q2 Medicare liability.
Opdivo has become a foundational immuno-oncology agent, and that is reflective in its continued strong performance. Physician adoption of Opdivo remained strong in markets that we have launched and have reimbursement with PD-1 shares of approximately 80% in the U.S. and in key international markets. With approvals now in 54 markets, international sales for Opdivo grew to $197 million in the quarter.
Sales in the U.S. grew 8% sequentially over fourth -- first quarter, driven by strong demand growth, which was partially offset by wholesaler inventory movements of approximately $45 million.
Yervoy sales were down 19% versus last year, driven mainly by pressure internationally from the launch of PD-1 agent.
In the U.S., Yervoy was up 32% compared to last year, driven by regimen use. We expect pressure to continue internationally until we secure reimbursement over the next year following our approval of the regimen in Europe for metastatic melanoma.
Daklinza had another good quarter with sales driven mainly by strong demand in the U.S. and Europe in the genotype 3 patient population. We expect that competition from recently approved therapies will significantly impact the U.S. business in the second half of this year.
In Europe, we also expect significant impact once access is secured. 
Empliciti sales in the U.S. were $33 million as we continue to focus on gaining new trial and driving demand in very competitive relapsed/refractory market. 
Now I move to our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.3% during the quarter, down 100 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is primarily due to profit mix, including the strong performance of Eliquis and the U.S. Abilify contract expiration.
MS&A was up 9% versus last year, driven by our investments behind new brands, including Opdivo, Eliquis and Empliciti. This was partially offset by lower spend on established products.
R&D expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter. The increase in spending was primarily due to grants, Opdivo study supplies and other immuno-oncology investments.
Other income was approximately $90 million up versus prior year, which benefited from royalties we now receive on Erbitux, R&D expense reimbursements from our deal with Bev [ph] and higher diabetes royalties. This was partially offset by the write-down of our uniQure equity investment of $45 million.
As I mentioned last quarter, diabetes royalties are higher in the first half of the year due to the tiering structure of our agreement with AUD. We therefore expect overall OI&E to be slightly lower in the second half of the year.
Business development remains a key priority and a strategic source of innovation for our company. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals and their novel antibody program targeting IL-8 as well as 4 clinical collaborations that support our combination strategy for immuno-oncology.
Switching to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.55 to $2.65. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen, we now expect the impact of foreign exchange on EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07.
I know our MS&A expense was higher than many of you expected during the quarter. This was primarily due to the timing of investments behind Opdivo, and we still expect MS&A to decrease in the low-single-digit range. We now expect R&D spend to increase in the mid-teens range, driven by investments in Opdivo and other immuno-oncology programs. This also accounts for the increased spending related to business development transactions completed this year.
The effective tax rate is now expected to be 22%. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong performance across the entirety of our company and now look forward to your questions."

Second, CTLA-4 seems to be associated with more late response and pseudoprogression that perhaps you see with PD-1. Thinking about your CheckMate-227 trial, how do we think about that within the context of PSS as a primary endpoint. Obviously, the Merck data is supported in this indication, but here we have the potential increased risk of pseudoprogression, again, just focusing on PSS. And then finally, there was some provocative data from one of your competitors in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer, non-MSI patients combining a MEK and PD-L1 agent. I think you're the only major PDX sponsor that doesn't have a MEK inhibitor in your portfolio.

And while we don't have an exact time line with respect to the publication of a potential final rule, obviously, that is what we are waiting for. I would say that what many stakeholders really have been concerned about is the possibility that changes that are suddenly introduced in the reimbursement mechanism for Part B products may have an impact in where patients are treated and lead to a reduced capacity to treat patients in the community, which obviously, will not be good for patients and would create significant burden for hospitals. And so that is one of the elements we will be looking for because obviously it's critically important for patients. With respect to the rule becoming voluntary, that we will have to see. Clearly, it is the timing which there are multiple other pilots in the market and therefore, a voluntary rule may enable physicians to participate in one pilot and not have a very complex set of schemes they have to operate under at the same time. So I would leave it at that."

As you correctly note, pseudoprogression was an issue in the early days of I-O with Yervoy but because we've generated a lot of data now with Yervoy monotherapy and, of course, with the combination. Because you have the benefit too of looking at that data before we designed our 227 study. And I can assure you we've taken it into account as we set up this advanced study. So we don't believe there will be an impact on the way we've done our study here. Talking about CRC, we've focused on diversifying across a very broad range of differentiated mechanisms of actions in evaluating different combinations with I-O. Based on those where we have a biological rationale, in particular, tumors and particularly where we're not seeing sufficient activity with Opdivo monotherapy or Opdivo+Yervoy regimen and that would include colorectal cancer. Now as you said, Roche presented Phase I data in combination of PD-L1 in combination with the MEK inhibitor. And I agree. While the data was early and the size of study was small, the combination did appear to show activity. We continue to look for combinations both externally or internally with our several early-stage assets, which would help us to identify patient populations and mechanisms and certainly CRC is a focus for that. I would just comment that we presented in the non-stable MSI in the MSI-high patient population very interesting data, not just monotherapy, but combination at ASCO. And so there are some parts of CRC where we think our regimen will have an effect."

So let me just take you through the analytical hierarchy here in the -026 study. So as you recall, if the primary endpoint of PFS in the strongly expressing patients is met, we will then also look at the total randomized population that includes all those that express a greater than the 1% level, which represents about 70% of the first-line patient population. If we hit PFS that is greater than 1%, we can then test for OS in both strongly expressing and greater than 1%. Now just to remind you, overall survival is a secondary endpoint in CheckMate -026, and we still can still file without a positive OS result. Now the selected population of high expressers is not 50%.  So we should be able to describe the effect at 50% cut-off once our analysis is complete. And just to finish, as I've noted in the past and I'll note again today, I'm confident in the study design of -026 and I look forward to seeing the data in weeks, not months."

And I think that will be really important point for us going forward because in lung cancer, Opdivo clearly has become the foundational therapy. We're also very pleased that we are seeing similar dynamics happen in every international market in which we have obtained reimbursement and launching. And overall, we continue to maintain a very high percentage of total PD-1 sales in the 80% range. As we think about our lung cancer strategy going into first line, as Francis mentioned, we are very confident in our understanding of the disease off Opdivo and in the design of the clinical trial. And overall, I would say, in the long term, we're also very comfortable with our strategy that has a really strong pillar in monotherapy, but then over the next year or so, we'll transition into the potential use of the combination therapy. So we feel we are very strongly positioned in first line today, and we have a really solid strategy for maintaining that leadership position going forward as immunotherapy moves into the first line setting.

Just to remind you, both studies allowed for PD-1 therapy after progression on chemo. And we're not actually aware any technical differences that will create a difference in the crossover.

I mentioned that over the last few months. We also made sure that the CheckMate -026 protocol that the patients on chemo were required actually to have their progression confirmed centrally before they were allowed to receive Opdivo. That's important because that reduce the amounts of wobble around that. So again, we think it's always an issue, but we think we've minimized that in terms of getting a potential result, both in terms of PFS and, of course, OS.

I would go back to what we said a few minutes ago at the beginning. Our experience is that given strong data and significant patient value, payers are providing access to combo regimens in I-O. And when you look at the evolution of combination regimens depending on the dose of different agents and the frequency of those, the incremental cost to payers is very sustainable. Because when you look at our regimen in melanoma, for example, during the phase of induction, which is the 12 weeks in which 2 products are used together, the cost of induction is only 6% higher than monotherapy. And then when you look at the regimen that we are taking into -227 of lung cancer, there is a lower dose of Yervoy, which is administered every 6 weeks. So all of that to say that at this point, we continue to think about the regimen that has the strongest data in the label and offers the most value to patients and the one that is reimbursed and one that is reimbursed by payers and adopted in the marketplace."

But in our recent organization this week, actually, we're sort of facing innovative dilemna and we certainly see the opportunity to take the next wave of combinations, and we sort of separated out the group that we'll look at that indeed to try and beat monotherapy -- I'm sorry, to beat the Yervoy+Opdivo combination. So we're certainly not being complacent at all about this, and we're trying to set up a situation where overall, we would want to have options for patients and certainly bring forward the best combination. And if we can beat Opdivo+Yervoy or make a batch in some way, we'll certainly be prepared to do that. And that's exactly what we're trying to do.

First, I would say, we're very pleased with the potential of Opdivo and Yervoy, and it's clearly at this point the only combination regimen that has demonstrated significant efficacy and an acceptable safety profile. We started that work in melanoma. We're clearly in R&D expanded and progressed that work very significantly in lung cancer. I believe that the doubling of response across all levels of PD-1 expression versus Opdivo monotherapy in lung cancer is studied well and was extremely promising. And we're also challenging ourselves, and we have challenged ourselves to find the regimens that are tolerable, which we believe we have with the new regimen in lung. At the same time, we are taking this combination regimen to many more tumor types, and the data continues to be extremely promising. So it's really not a dogma, but in reality, it is a proven mechanism of treatment of patients that is demonstrating clinical trial -- other clinical trials to really have big role to play. As Francis said, our objective is, at the same time, to continue to accelerate new mechanisms of action into the clinic. That's why we have 8 immuno-oncology agents into early development, and we will continue to work to raise the bar beyond what we think is already a very important accomplishment with Opdivo and Yervoy."

We have a lot to talk about this morning, so I'll start by summarizing my views on the performance in the quarter and then turn to our guidance for '16 and our thinking about 2017. I'll share some thoughts about our long-term strategy and then hand it over to Charlie to provide additional details about our performance and operations. 
So to begin, we just finished another very good quarter. Our business fundamentals are strong, as evidenced by our commercial performance. We delivered $4.9 billion in revenues, a full 21% increase over last year, thanks to good business trends across our portfolio. We made important regulatory advances with OPDIVO. We received the positive advisory opinion for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in Europe. Our application for advanced bladder cancer has been accepted for priority review in the U.S. and validated in Europe.  And in the next few weeks, we expect to get a decision on our application for OPDIVO for head and neck cancer in the U.S. 
We had disappointing results from CheckMate -026. The results of this trial do not, however, change our strategy. We've applied learnings from the trial to our entire development program, and we are advancing a broad set of opportunities for OPDIVO. We see an even more important role for combinations, continue to be excited by the longer-term follow-up [ph] from Study -012 and believe Study -227 has the potential to bring real value to patients. 
More generally, we remain fully confident in our OPDIVO development program, which is both broad and promising, with data expected from 8 potentially registrational trials over the next 12 months. And based on our current assumptions for '17, we expect OPDIVO sales to grow globally as well as in the U.S. The trends are good, and we feel optimistic about OPDIVO in both the short and the long term. 
In light of our overall strong company performance, we are increasing our '16 non-GAAP EPS guidance to between $2.80 and $2.90. Based on our current assumptions, we expect '17 non-GAAP EPS to be between $2.85 and $3.05. 
Looking forward, I believe that we are very well positioned for sustainable growth, which, over the next 3 to 5 years, will be driven primarily by ELIQUIS, OPDIVO and Yervoy. Beyond that, we expect our overall marketed products to continue to grow, and we are excited about our early-stage pipeline and the progress it is making. 
Our strategy continues to guide how we think about the future and our long-term growth, and we are always looking at how we can stay ahead of the curve. Over the past year, we have started work on an evolution of our operating model in order to ensure we increasingly focus our resources on our highest priorities, both from an R&D perspective as well as commercially. So we continue to effectively deliver on the potential of our business. To be clear, this process was started early in 2016, and I discussed this with our employees in June. I am excited with the results of our work and confident we can be even more competitive while effectively managing our total expenses. 
Let me say a little more. As a company that has continually evolved, we are committed to operating in a way that puts resources against our most critical priorities. Over the next 18 months, we will evolve our operating model in 4 areas. We will prioritize resources to focus even more on a core set of key brands and a core set of key markets positioned to drive growth over time. For example, there are about 20 markets which are critical for us, and we will continue to invest to be very competitive commercially. 
We will continue investing in R&D to ensure a sustainable pipeline of transformational medicines. We are improving our capabilities in R&D to ensure speed, adaptability and flexibility. We will focus on accelerating development and delivery of our most promising assets. As an example, our R&D spend will increase in '17 versus '16. 
We have made significant progress optimizing our manufacturing network, and we'll continue to evolve it in line with our portfolio. Biologics are now about 75% of our development portfolio, so we will continue to invest in our biologics capabilities, as evidenced by our recent investments in Devens and Cruiserath. At the same time, we will realign, streamline and simplify our small molecule supply network. 
We will have a more streamlined G&A, more strategically aligned through the focused way we will run our business. My expectation is that with a more streamlined infrastructure, we will be a more focused and nimble company, better positioned to deliver in the short and long term, better equipped to deliver our transformational portfolio of medicines. And we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to remain flat at '16 levels through 2020. 
While transforming our company, we will continue to drive strong R&D execution and commercial performance. We know the importance of operating on 2 fronts, today and tomorrow, and that is exactly what we've been doing. 
And finally, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, with the commitment to the dividend and business development as a priority. Importantly, our board has unanimously approved an incremental $3 billion share repurchase authorization, and Charlie will comment on this in his remarks. 
But before handing the floor over to him, I just want to underscore how personally excited I am about all we are doing to build our future. And as we set our sights on the future, we see even greater possibilities for Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
So with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."
25798,383109224,1063177,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was, indeed, an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21%",1095,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was, indeed, an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. 
We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21% sales growth and an almost doubling of EPS compared to Q3 last year.  Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we saw strong commercial execution in the quarter. Let me provide some color. OPDIVO demand remains strong. In the U.S., we recorded $712 million of sales, up 11% sequentially. OPDIVO-based therapy has become established as standard of care in the U.S. across melanoma, renal cell and second-line non-small cell lung cancer. While our second-line lung business will be under some pressure, we believe we have opportunities for growth in renal, melanoma and Hodgkin's as well as future indications such as bladder and head and neck. In addition, over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see important readouts for several tumor types that we believe will position the brand for further growth. 
Outside the U.S., we recorded $208 million for OPDIVO during the quarter. This does not include approximately $150 million of gross sales for France and Germany in the quarter, which are being deferred. The amount we will actually recognize depends on the final price in each country, and we do expect to reach an agreement for both later this year. 
From an operational perspective, we continue to see strong adoption in markets where OPDIVO has been launched. For example, we continue to see 70% to 80% of PD-1 share in France and Germany. We have also made good progress this quarter securing reimbursement among key EU markets such as Denmark and Sweden. 
Looking beyond OPDIVO, we are particularly encouraged to see Yervoy return to growth during the quarter, with sales of $285 million, up over last year and sequentially. 
The quarter saw stabilized sales trends outside the U.S. and an increase in U.S. sales, driven by higher demand for the regimen in metastatic disease and adoption of Yervoy in the adjuvant setting. All of this is in addition to a favorable inventory build of about $26 million. 
While the regimen continues to do well in the U.S., we are also seeing increased adoption of the regimen internationally. For example, during the quarter, roughly 40% of first-line melanoma patients in Germany were receiving the regimen. 
Let me now turn to ELIQUIS. We reported a strong quarter for ELIQUIS with sales of $884 million, up 90% compared to the same period last year and up 14% compared with Q2. Not only does ELIQUIS continue to be the #1 new-to-brand NOAC in the U.S. and other markets, but this quarter, ELIQUIS has also emerged as the leader in NBRx in the U.S. for the broader oral anticoagulant market. With U.S. sales over $500 million this quarter, ELIQUIS has established a considerable lead in terms of new-to-brand share of AFib and BTE with 51% share compared with 42% for XARELTO. 
Outside the U.S., we also saw solid growth, with sales of $372 million, up 68% compared to last year. ELIQUIS is now the leading NOAC in new-to-brand scripts with cardiologists in 6 countries in the EU. 
Our hep C portfolio delivered solid performance, with sales of $379 million in the quarter. However, as we expected, the U.S. business has been under pressure following the launch of EPCLUSA in June. U.S. sales were $192 million, which is down $100 million from Q2. We expect an additional step-down in demand in the U.S. in January when new formularies will likely prioritize EPCLUSA. As we saw with the rapid decline in our Japanese business, we expect an impact on the rest of our international business once access is secured for EPCLUSA. 
Now I'd like to highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin continues to be strongly influenced by mix. During the quarter, it was down 170 basis points compared to Q2. This is mainly due to strong sales of ELIQUIS and lower revenue from hep C. Given that we expect these trends in our product mix to persist, we would expect our gross margin to be impacted going forward. 
Other income and expense was up approximately $150 million versus prior year and continues to benefit from royalties we now receive on Erbitux.  
Based on our strong performance, we are adjusting upward our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. Our view on revenue is favorable given the trends we are seeing in the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we view our gross margin to be slightly lower primarily due to product mix, somewhat offset by FX. 
Today, we provided 2017 guidance, which takes into account the current strong business trends that we expect will support continued earnings growth through next year. As Giovanni mentioned, our view on 2017 assumes continued growth of OPDIVO, both internationally and in the U.S. As is our normal practice, we will provide per line item guidance in January. 
As we look to the future, we feel very confident about the company's opportunities for continued growth. We are not providing any guidance beyond 2017, but as Giovanni said, our strategy continues to guide how we think about our future. We see tremendous opportunities in our I-O pipeline and are advancing our specialty portfolio. We are committed to putting resources where we can deliver the greatest value. We are evolving the company's operating model and believe these changes will help drive the company's continued success in the near and long term. 
Giovanni mentioned that we expect non-GAAP OpEx to remain flat through 2020, but this is not across the board. Our focus is on prioritizing resources where we see the greatest opportunity. For example, we expect to increase our investment in R&D in 2017, but that requires us to prioritize and drive efficiencies in other areas. 
I'll finish up on capital allocation. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation and have significant financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet. Business development remains our top priority, and we have also demonstrated our commitment to the dividend with 7 consecutive years of increases. Our board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase, providing for additional flexibility to buy back our shares. We hope to begin executing the 10b5-1 plan as soon as this year and expect to repurchase $200 million to $300 million per quarter. We believe this approach gives us the appropriate flexibility moving forward. 
Now let me pass it back to John."

When we were going to have the competitive pressure with both the approval of [indiscernible] and first line and the reduction of that population of I-O-treated patients from the eligible second line pool. That will be somewhat rate limited by testing. We do anticipate that there will be an acceleration in the testing rate, but there's still a swap to this curve, and Merck will rapidly penetrate that patient population, there will be a certain cadence to how that will occur because of the testing rates. Testing rates right now are about 50%, and we have seen a slight acceleration in that rate more recently. When we think about the second line opportunity, we continue to feel very good about our profile on the basis of -017 and -057. But clearly second-line shares are going to go under pressure from the advent of Roche in the second line setting. The one thing I'll just clarify is while Mark were able to secure a label update in second line has greater than 1% cut off, that information was included in NCC and Compendia for many, many months now so that's not necessarily a new competitive event for us in second line. Overall, some of the things that we continue to feel good about in second line or just our competitiveness from share voice as well as the breadth of indications across OPDIVO. So while we expect some share pressure in second line and lung, other sources of growth other indications namely the advancement of the regimen in melanoma and that offers the 40% share in first line melanoma across both -- in both types of patients, BRAF positive and mutant. Renal cell carcinoma, our business continues to do well there. We're hopeful that we'll have a head and neck indication soon. And the next year, hopefully, also bladder in the U.S. As Giovanni mentioned, we're also very pleased with expansion of our business outside the U.S. where the clear demand trends are very good post-reimbursement events. You can't see all of that in our revenue, strongly mentioned, we're deferring sales and trends in Germany in the quarter. But really, our shares are upwards of 70% overall PD-1 dollar market outside the U.S. So really, we're feeling good about our very balanced growth portfolio in I-O. And last but not least, it was mentioned by Charlie, Yervoy has returned to growth in the U.S. and in both France and Germany where we have the regimen reimbursed, we've seen very good evolution there, too."

Just to talk for a moment about CheckMate -568 just remind you that it's a single arm study looking at the combination of Yervoy and OPDIVO in first line lung. The primary endpoint here is response rates, and it gives us a lot of flexibility to look when and how often we look at the data. I think we see a complementary to the CheckMate -012 data. It's particularly useful to provide some information on current and future medical practice, particularly within I-O-I-O combination.

So that opportunity is quite significant. It's really concentrated in terms of the therapeutic areas. And also quite concentrated in the top 20 markets around the world.

Based on this, based on the nature of the data we have from OPDIVO + Yervoy and the long term follow up that we disclosed recently for the combination of these 2 agents and from CheckMate -012, we believe that CheckMate -227 has potential to fulfill this great share. Specifically, when you look at Yervoy, which is it tier [indiscernible] agent Opdivo [indiscernible] every 6 weeks with OPDIVO this really becoming probably or potentially a solid backbone moving forward. We view this not only in lung cancer, but we view this combination of immunotherapy agents also working and active in a variety of cancer. I would finish by saying that each time we added a CTLA 4 blockade with Yervoy to PD-1 OPDIVO, we have seen the activity increase and almost doubling in a variety of cancer with -- importantly, with a long durability of the effect."

And then how you hope to plan -- hope to and plan to avoid is in the CheckMate -227 study? Second question is more for Charlie. As of the end of this quarter, could you just update us on how much has actually been reserved for in France and Germany? I know you guys updated that in the Q every quarter now. And just a follow-up to that is would that be booked -- should we assume that's booked this year based on your comments? And as the growth outlook for OPDIVO assume that those sales booked are in the base as we think about growth year-over-year?"

And basically, we agree with your opinion [indiscernible] that we recalled the presenter of the CheckMate -026 that had the [indiscernible] 24 design being used with OPDIVO rather than KEYTRUDA as a result would likely being similar. So as we shift our focus towards CheckMate -227, we are confident that not only the profile of OPDIVO-Yervoy regimen, but the lessons we've learned from -026, and I'll ask Fouad to give you some of the very specifics.

And Two things to see and understand the -227 learning from -026. So first and foremost, going in -227 with the combination data is different, the level of activity that we have seen in monotherapy in -026 is higher response rate, has much longer PFS with solid follow up and this time, improved safety profile from we knew the reason before. Actually, we allow the study and the expressers and continue to recruit and as I said earlier, is nearly probably 2 to 3 weeks time before finishing the recruitment with larger number of patients than initially planned and we would expect in the 3 arms that the size will be nearly doubling that we have seen in CheckMate -026. So this in itself is important to correct for the imbalances the way we look at it. And I would add, obviously, one more thing that is different in -227 is we did not bid in a crossover like we did in CheckMate -026. And as practical matter, it means that patients have been randomized into chemotherapy can receive the appropriate amount of care into the PD-L1 monotherapy and the second line and where it is commercially available. And, however, it's important to note that patients will not receive the regimen of OPDIVO-Yervoy when the tumor progress."

So I'm just curious to know what your thoughts on that is and how that's going to play out. Also just going back to Seamus' question I think one of the other issues, too was CheckMate -026 and KEYNOTE-024 is that both trials are recruiting around the same time and there was a lot of overlap in clinical trial sites. You guys ended up with the key patients, they got the A patients. Is that a risk with MYSTIC and CheckMate -227. I mean, obviously, after concerning their own I-O-I-O trial, and what are you doing just to avoid that? I mean, you sort of answered it, but do have you had any control over the recruitment of imbalances in patient? Because I think, again, that was something that kind of came in as a surprise."

So the 3-week versus 2-week tends to be an issue that considered later in the treatment consideration. So the first consideration obviously efficacy where the profile of OPDIVO is very strong across all histologists and across all types of PD-L1 expression. And then the other thing that's really influencing treatment decision-making is the breadth of indications that we are now developing for OPDIVO. And then I would say, the dosing cadence comes into consideration. I'd also stress that in the community setting in the United States, in particular, the dosing interval of 2-week versus 3-week tends not to be an issue."

I will say though we have been focusing on the second-line tested patients and making sure that oncologists understand the strength of our data in high expressing second-line patients from 017 and 057, and we have seen significant increases in our share of that population and second-line.

In the non-squamous, there are tumor that are inflamed and there are some groups that really see probably some level of inflammation like the squamous.

We have a lot to talk about this morning, so I'll start by summarizing my views on the performance in the quarter and then turn to our guidance for '16 and our thinking about 2017. I'll share some thoughts about our long-term strategy and then hand it over to Charlie to provide additional details about our performance and operations. 
So to begin, we just finished another very good quarter. Our business fundamentals are strong, as evidenced by our commercial performance. We delivered $4.9 billion in revenues, a full 21% increase over last year, thanks to good business trends across our portfolio. We made important regulatory advances with OPDIVO. We received the positive advisory opinion for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in Europe. Our application for advanced bladder cancer has been accepted for priority review in the U.S. and validated in Europe.  And in the next few weeks, we expect to get a decision on our application for OPDIVO for head and neck cancer in the U.S. 
We had disappointing results from CheckMate -026. The results of this trial do not, however, change our strategy. We've applied learnings from the trial to our entire development program, and we are advancing a broad set of opportunities for OPDIVO. We see an even more important role for combinations, continue to be excited by the longer-term follow-up from Study -012 and believe Study -227 has the potential to bring real value to patients. 
More generally, we remain fully confident in our OPDIVO development program, which is both broad and promising, with data expected from 8 potentially registrational trials over the next 12 months. And based on our current assumptions for '17, we expect OPDIVO sales to grow globally as well as in the U.S. The trends are good, and we feel optimistic about OPDIVO in both the short and the long term. 
In light of our overall strong company performance, we are increasing our '16 non-GAAP EPS guidance to between $2.80 and $2.90. Based on our current assumptions, we expect '17 non-GAAP EPS to be between $2.85 and $3.05. 
Looking forward, I believe that we are very well positioned for sustainable growth, which, over the next 3 to 5 years, will be driven primarily by ELIQUIS, OPDIVO and Yervoy. Beyond that, we expect our overall marketed products to continue to grow, and we are excited about our early-stage pipeline and the progress it is making. 
Our strategy continues to guide how we think about the future and our long-term growth, and we are always looking at how we can stay ahead of the curve. Over the past year, we have started work on an evolution of our operating model in order to ensure we increasingly focus our resources on our highest priorities, both from an R&D perspective as well as commercially. So we continue to effectively deliver on the potential of our business. To be clear, this process was started early in 2016, and I discussed this with our employees in June. I am excited with the results of our work and confident we can be even more competitive while effectively managing our total expenses. 
Let me say a little more. As a company that has continually evolved, we are committed to operating in a way that puts resources against our most critical priorities. Over the next 18 months, we will evolve our operating model in 4 areas. We will prioritize resources to focus even more on a core set of key brands and a core set of key markets positioned to drive growth over time. For example, there are about 20 markets which are critical for us, and we will continue to invest to be very competitive commercially. 
We will continue investing in R&D to ensure a sustainable pipeline of transformational medicines. We are improving our capabilities in R&D to ensure speed, adaptability and flexibility. We will focus on accelerating development and delivery of our most promising assets. As an example, our R&D spend will increase in '17 versus '16. 
We have made significant progress optimizing our manufacturing network, and we'll continue to evolve it in line with our portfolio. Biologics are now about 75% of our development portfolio, so we will continue to invest in our biologics capabilities, as evidenced by our recent investments in Devens and Cruiserath. At the same time, we will realign, streamline and simplify our small molecule supply network. 
We will have a more streamlined G&A, more strategically aligned through the focused way we will run our business. My expectation is that with a more streamlined infrastructure, we will be a more focused and nimble company, better positioned to deliver in the short and long term, better equipped to deliver our transformational portfolio of medicines. And we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to remain flat at '16 levels through 2020. 
While transforming our company, we will continue to drive strong R&D execution and commercial performance. We know the importance of operating on 2 fronts, today and tomorrow, and that is exactly what we've been doing. 
And finally, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, with the commitment to the dividend and business development as a priority. Importantly, our board has unanimously approved an incremental $3 billion share repurchase authorization, and Charlie will comment on this in his remarks. 
But before handing the floor over to him, I just want to underscore how personally excited I am about all we are doing to build our future. And as we set our sights on the future, we see even greater possibilities for Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
So with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."
25798,383109224,1063594,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was, indeed, an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21%",1095,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was, indeed, an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. 
We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21% sales growth and an almost doubling of EPS compared to Q3 last year.  Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we saw strong commercial execution in the quarter. Let me provide some color. OPDIVO demand remains strong. In the U.S., we recorded $712 million of sales, up 11% sequentially. OPDIVO-based therapy has become established as standard of care in the U.S. across melanoma, renal cell and second-line non-small cell lung cancer. While our second-line lung business will be under some pressure, we believe we have opportunities for growth in renal, melanoma and Hodgkin's as well as future indications such as bladder and head and neck. In addition, over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see important readouts for several tumor types that we believe will position the brand for further growth. 
Outside the U.S., we recorded $208 million for OPDIVO during the quarter. This does not include approximately $150 million of gross sales for France and Germany in the quarter, which are being deferred. The amount we will actually recognize depends on the final price in each country, and we do expect to reach an agreement for both later this year. 
From an operational perspective, we continue to see strong adoption in markets where OPDIVO has been launched. For example, we continue to see 70% to 80% of PD-1 share in France and Germany. We have also made good progress this quarter securing reimbursement among key EU markets such as Denmark and Sweden. 
Looking beyond OPDIVO, we are particularly encouraged to see Yervoy return to growth during the quarter, with sales of $285 million, up over last year and sequentially. 
The quarter saw stabilized sales trends outside the U.S. and an increase in U.S. sales, driven by higher demand for the regimen in metastatic disease and adoption of Yervoy in the adjuvant setting. All of this is in addition to a favorable inventory build of about $26 million. 
While the regimen continues to do well in the U.S., we are also seeing increased adoption of the regimen internationally. For example, during the quarter, roughly 40% of first-line melanoma patients in Germany were receiving the regimen. 
Let me now turn to ELIQUIS. We reported a strong quarter for ELIQUIS with sales of $884 million, up 90% compared to the same period last year and up 14% compared with Q2. Not only does ELIQUIS continue to be the #1 new-to-brand NOAC in the U.S. and other markets, but this quarter, ELIQUIS has also emerged as the leader in NBRx in the U.S. for the broader oral anticoagulant market. With U.S. sales over $500 million this quarter, ELIQUIS has established a considerable lead in terms of new-to-brand share of AFib and BTE with 51% share compared with 42% for XARELTO. 
Outside the U.S., we also saw solid growth, with sales of $372 million, up 68% compared to last year. ELIQUIS is now the leading NOAC in new-to-brand scripts with cardiologists in 6 countries in the EU. 
Our hep C portfolio delivered solid performance, with sales of $379 million in the quarter. However, as we expected, the U.S. business has been under pressure following the launch of EPCLUSA in June. U.S. sales were $192 million, which is down $100 million from Q2. We expect an additional step-down in demand in the U.S. in January when new formularies will likely prioritize EPCLUSA. As we saw with the rapid decline in our Japanese business, we expect an impact on the rest of our international business once access is secured for EPCLUSA. 
Now I'd like to highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin continues to be strongly influenced by mix. During the quarter, it was down 170 basis points compared to Q2. This is mainly due to strong sales of ELIQUIS and lower revenue from hep C. Given that we expect these trends in our product mix to persist, we would expect our gross margin to be impacted going forward. 
Other income and expense was up approximately $150 million versus prior year and continues to benefit from royalties we now receive on Erbitux.  
Based on our strong performance, we are adjusting upward our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. Our view on revenue is favorable given the trends we are seeing in the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we view our gross margin to be slightly lower primarily due to product mix, somewhat offset by FX. 
Today, we provided 2017 guidance, which takes into account the current strong business trends that we expect will support continued earnings growth through next year. As Giovanni mentioned, our view on 2017 assumes continued growth of OPDIVO, both internationally and in the U.S. As is our normal practice, we will provide per line item guidance in January. 
As we look to the future, we feel very confident about the company's opportunities for continued growth. We are not providing any guidance beyond 2017, but as Giovanni said, our strategy continues to guide how we think about our future. We see tremendous opportunities in our I-O pipeline and are advancing our specialty portfolio. We are committed to putting resources where we can deliver the greatest value. We are evolving the company's operating model and believe these changes will help drive the company's continued success in the near and long term. 
Giovanni mentioned that we expect non-GAAP OpEx to remain flat through 2020, but this is not across the board. Our focus is on prioritizing resources where we see the greatest opportunity. For example, we expect to increase our investment in R&D in 2017, but that requires us to prioritize and drive efficiencies in other areas. 
I'll finish up on capital allocation. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation and have significant financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet. Business development remains our top priority, and we have also demonstrated our commitment to the dividend with 7 consecutive years of increases. Our board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase, providing for additional flexibility to buy back our shares. We hope to begin executing the 10b5-1 plan as soon as this year and expect to repurchase $200 million to $300 million per quarter. We believe this approach gives us the appropriate flexibility moving forward. 
Now let me pass it back to John."

I believe several of your OPDIVO indications have been either filed or approved based on single-arm Phase II studies, I think like Hodgkins as an example. How do we think about, just maybe more broadly, indications that you would be able to file on Phase II data versus indications where you're going to need fully controlled studies? Is this the size of the indication? Is it the lack of a standard of care, the existing therapies? Is it the strength of the data?

We see ELIQUIS continuing to grow and continue to make inroads in terms of market shares in the U.S. and internationally. We see continued strong performance from our [indiscernible] business with OPDIVO -- sorry, with ORENCIA and Sprycel. And we do see strong momentum globally with OPDIVO, which includes, clearly, the 3 big areas we look at when we look at our business: the international launches that are progressing extremely well; and expansion of our business across multiple indications in the U.S.; and then obviously, the lung business, which, as Charlie said, will be under some pressure.

When we think about where we are currently in lung, we feel, obviously, very good about performance to date with roughly 60% to 70% share overall in [indiscernible] and second-line lung. And clearly, we're going to have competitive pressure with both the approval of pembro in first-line and the reduction of that population of I-O-treated patients from the eligible second-line pool. That will be somewhat rate limited by testing. We do anticipate that there will be an acceleration in the testing rate, but there's still a slope to that curve, and that -- while Merck will rapidly penetrate that patient population, there will be a certain cadence to how that will occur because of the testing rates. Testing rates right now are about 50%, and we have seen a slight acceleration in that rate more recently. When we think about the second-line opportunity, we continue to feel very good about our profile on the basis of -017 and -057, but clearly, second-line shares are going to be under pressure from the advent of Roche in the second-line setting. The one thing I'll just clarify is while Merck were able to secure a label update in second-line at the greater-than-1% cutoff, that information was included in NCCN compendia for many, many months now, so that's not necessarily a new competitive event for us in second-line. Overall, some of the things that we continue to feel good about in second-line are just our competitiveness from a share voice as well as the breadth of indications across OPDIVO. So while we expect some share pressure in second-line and lung, other sources of growth are other indications, namely the advancement of the regimen in melanoma, and that offers a 40% share in first-line melanoma across both -- in both types of patients, BRAF-positive and mutant. Renal cell carcinoma, our business continues to do well there. We're hopeful that we'll have a head and neck indication soon. And then next year, hopefully, also bladder in the U.S. As Giovanni mentioned, we're also very pleased with the expansion of our business outside the U.S., where the clear demand trends are very good post-reimbursement events. You can't see all of that in our revenue. As Charlie mentioned, we're deferring sales in France and Germany in the quarter. But really, our shares are upwards of 70% overall PD-1 dollar market outside the U.S. So really, we're feeling good about our very balanced growth portfolio in I-O. And last but not least, it was mentioned by Charlie, Yervoy has returned to growth in the U.S. And in both France and Germany, where we have the regimen reimbursed, we've seen very good evolution there, too."

Just to talk for a moment about CheckMate -568, just to remind you that it's a single-arm study looking at the combination of Yervoy and OPDIVO in first-line lung. The primary endpoint here is response rates, and it gives us a lot of flexibility to look when and how often we look at the data. And I think we see it as complementary to the CheckMate -012 data. It's particularly useful to provide some information on current and future medical practice, particularly within IO-IO combination. We believe it will be helping in categorizing the high response rates we saw in CheckMate -012, and importantly, it's evaluating the same dose as we've got in CheckMate -227.

As we, both Charlie and I, mentioned, continuing to evolve the way we allocate resources in the company is really driven by the opportunities we see in the portfolio. As we've said in the past, when you look at the next 3 to 5 years, we have a great opportunity for growth, which is really driven by the performance of our immuno-oncology franchise, with OPDIVO and Yervoy and ELIQUIS as significant drivers of growth. So that opportunity is quite significant. It's really concentrated in terms of the therapeutic areas and also quite concentrated in the top 20 markets around the world. At the same time, we are advancing an early pipeline, which continues to make progress. In that pipeline, as time advances, there are programs that are emerging. It's very high-potential programs, and we are ready to make the investment decisions needed in order to accelerate those programs as the data evolves. As I commented earlier also, we do see continued opportunity to streamline our G&A, to streamline our infrastructure, to look at our manufacturing network all the time, driven by our portfolio.

Based on this and based on the nature of the data we have from OPDIVO plus Yervoy and the long-term follow-up that we disclosed recently for the combination of these 2 agents and from CheckMate -012, we believe that CheckMate -227 has potential to fulfill this criteria. Specifically, when you look at Yervoy, which is a [indiscernible]-depleting agent, optimally spaced every 6 weeks with OPDIVO, this is really becoming probably or potentially a solid backbone moving forward. We view this not only in lung cancer, but we view this combination of immunotherapy agents also working and active in a variety of cancer. I would finish by saying that each time we add a CTLA-4 blockade with Yervoy to PD-1 OPDIVO, we have seen the activity increase and almost doubling in a variety of cancer with -- importantly, with a long durability of the effect."

Level of activity that we have seen in monotherapy in -026 is higher response rate and much longer PFS with solid follow-up at this time and an improved safety profile from what we knew [indiscernible] before. Actually, we allowed the study in the expressor to continue to recruit, and as I said earlier, it's nearing probably 2 to 3 weeks' time before finishing the recruitment with a larger number of patients than initially planned. And we would expect in the 3 arms, that the size will be nearly doubling that we have seen in CheckMate -026. So this in itself is important to correct for the imbalances, the way we look at it. And I would add, obviously, one more thing that is different in -227 is we did not bid in a crossover like we did in CheckMate -026. And as practical matter, it means that patients that have been randomized into chemotherapy can receive the appropriate standard of care, including PD-1 monotherapy, in second-line and where it is commercially available.

So the 3-week versus 2-week tends to be an issue that is considered later in the treatment consideration. So the first consideration is obviously efficacy, where the profile of OPDIVO is very strong across all histologists and across all types of PD-L1 expression. And then the other thing that's really influencing treatment decision-making is the breadth of indications that we are now developing for OPDIVO.

I will say, though, we have been focusing on the second-line tested patients and making sure that oncologists understand the strength of our data in high expressing second-line patients from -017 and -057, and we have seen significant increases in our share of that population in second-line.

This is probably telling us that in the squamous biology of very inflamed tumor, that that's the type of tumor that respond to a PD-1 agent. In the non-squamous, there are tumor that are inflamed, and there are some groups that really see probably some level of inflammation like the squamous. Given -- and this could be detected by enriching in the PD-L1 biomarker and to have other marker of the inflammation in the non-squamous. In -026, really, we're broad. We were -- we stratified to the 5% cutoff.

We see -- first of all, our evolution of the operating model is very consistent in a way with what we've been discussing with all of you over the last few months in terms of allocating resources strategically, accelerating the pipeline and generating the right leverage as we grow as a company. We quantified how we can do that more and better today, and my perspective is that from an R&D point of view, it really is about having the resources necessary in order to invest in the highest-potential programs. So I would not characterize that as having raised the hurdle. I would characterize that as having the ability to allocate the right resources to R&D in order to accelerate promising programs. And as Charlie mentioned, as an example, next year, we are increasing R&D spend because we see very strong momentum in the early pipeline and clearly, with OPDIVO and Yervoy. Clearly, on the same side -- the same level commercially, we built very competitive commercial organizations in the key markets, and that, we continue to be really committed to. It's really about disproportionate resource allocation to the highest priority areas. And there will be parts of the company, in fact, that grow or experience very little change, while we will be making decisions to reduce our focus in parts of the company like, for example, some of the G&A functions where we think we can become a leaner organization, actually accelerating the ability to execute at the same time."

What we've seen in the market to date has been really very predictable in terms of what the oncologists and payers are doing, is they're responding to data events that trigger NCCN guidelines and compendia updates and also are respectful of the labeled indications of the products. So I would say in our forecast, we have not assumed any retreatment of pembrolizumab first-line-exposed patients in our second-line opportunity. We have taken them out of our second-line pool of eligible patients. And I would say it's very likely, given the clarity of the NCCN compendium and the clarity of the pembrolizumab indications, that the pretreated or first-line-treated patient population will be very close to the label greater-than-50% expression, and so that limits the pool of previously I-O-treated patients that get excluded from second-line, at least quite a large pool of second-line patients that are still eligible for OPDIVO treatment in the second-line."

And when I say a very long period of time, if you look at our data overall, we've not even reached median of duration of response. And why we look at that and why that's important because that's really a good surrogate for improvement of survival. And improvement of survival is an important endpoint, to look at it, for lung cancer because that's what basically we'll be looking at at the end.

We have a lot to talk about this morning, so I'll start by summarizing my views on the performance in the quarter and then turn to our guidance for '16 and our thinking about 2017. I'll share some thoughts about our long-term strategy and then hand it over to Charlie to provide additional details about our performance and operations. 
So to begin, we just finished another very good quarter. Our business fundamentals are strong, as evidenced by our commercial performance. We delivered $4.9 billion in revenues, a full 21% increase over last year, thanks to good business trends across our portfolio. We made important regulatory advances with OPDIVO. We received a positive advisory opinion for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in Europe. Our application for advanced bladder cancer has been accepted for priority review in the U.S. and validated in Europe. And in the next few weeks, we expect to get a decision on our application for OPDIVO for head and neck cancer in the U.S. 
We had disappointing results from CheckMate -026. The results of this trial do not, however, change our strategy. We've applied learnings from the trial to our entire development program, and we are advancing a broad set of opportunities for OPDIVO. We see an even more important role for combinations, continue to be excited by the longer-term follow-up from Study -012 and believe Study -227 has the potential to bring real value to patients. 
More generally, we remain fully confident in our OPDIVO development program, which is both broad and promising, with data expected from 8 potentially registrational trials over the next 12 months. And based on our current assumptions for '17, we expect OPDIVO sales to grow globally as well as in the U.S. The trends are good, and we feel optimistic about OPDIVO in both the short and the long term. 
In light of our overall strong company performance, we are increasing our '16 non-GAAP EPS guidance to between $2.80 and $2.90. Based on our current assumptions, we expect '17 non-GAAP EPS to be between $2.85 and $3.05. 
Looking forward, I believe that we are very well positioned for sustainable growth, which, over the next 3 to 5 years, will be driven primarily by ELIQUIS, OPDIVO and Yervoy. Beyond that, we expect our overall marketed products to continue to grow, and we are excited about our early-stage pipeline and the progress it is making. 
Our strategy continues to guide how we think about the future and our long-term growth, and we are always looking at how we can stay ahead of the curve. Over the past year, we have started work on an evolution of our operating model in order to ensure we increasingly focus our resources on our highest priorities, both from an R&D perspective as well as commercially. So we continue to effectively deliver on the potential of our business. To be clear, this process was started early in 2016, and I discussed this with our employees in June. I am excited with the results of our work and confident we can be even more competitive while effectively managing our total expenses. 
Let me say a little more. As a company that has continually evolved, we are committed to operating in a way that puts resources against our most critical priorities. Over the next 18 months, we will evolve our operating model in 4 areas. We will prioritize resources to focus even more on a core set of key brands and a core set of key markets positioned to drive growth over time. For example, there are about 20 markets which are critical for us, and we will continue to invest to be very competitive commercially. 
We will continue investing in R&D to ensure a sustainable pipeline of transformational medicines. We are improving our capabilities in R&D to ensure speed, adaptability and flexibility. We will focus on accelerating development and delivery of our most promising assets. As an example, our R&D spend will increase in '17 versus '16. 
We have made significant progress optimizing our manufacturing network, and we'll continue to evolve it in line with our portfolio. Biologics are now about 75% of our development portfolio, so we will continue to invest in our biologics capabilities, as evidenced by our recent investments in Devens and Cruiserath. At the same time, we will realign, streamline and simplify our small molecule supply network. 
We will have a more streamlined G&A, more strategically aligned through the focused way we will run our business. My expectation is that with a more streamlined infrastructure, we will be a more focused and nimble company, better positioned to deliver in the short and long term, better equipped to deliver our transformational portfolio of medicines. And we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to remain flat at '16 levels through 2020. 
While transforming our company, we will continue to drive strong R&D execution and commercial performance. We know the importance of operating on 2 fronts, today and tomorrow, and that is exactly what we've been doing. 
And finally, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, with the commitment to the dividend and business development as a priority. Importantly, our board has unanimously approved an incremental $3 billion share repurchase authorization, and Charlie will comment on this in his remarks. 
But before handing the floor over to him, I just want to underscore how personally excited I am about all we are doing to build our future. And as we set our sights on the future, we see even greater possibilities for Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
So with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."
25798,383109224,1063924,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was indeed an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21% sa",1095,"Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was indeed an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. 
We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21% sales growth and an almost doubling of EPS compared to Q3 last year.  Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we saw strong commercial execution in the quarter. Let me provide some color. OPDIVO demand remains strong. In the U.S., we recorded $712 million of sales, up 11% sequentially. OPDIVO-based therapy has become established as standard of care in the U.S. across melanoma, renal cell and second-line non-small cell lung cancer. While our second-line lung business will be under some pressure, we believe we have opportunities for growth in renal, melanoma and Hodgkin's as well as future indications such as bladder and head and neck. In addition, over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see important readouts for several tumor types that we believe will position the brand for further growth. 
Outside the U.S., we recorded $208 million for OPDIVO during the quarter. This does not include approximately $150 million of gross sales for France and Germany in the quarter, which are being deferred. The amount we will actually recognize depends on the final price in each country, and we do expect to reach an agreement for both later this year. 
From an operational perspective, we continue to see strong adoption in markets where OPDIVO had been launched. For example, we continue to see 70% to 80% of PD-1 share in France and Germany. We have also made good progress this quarter securing reimbursement among key EU markets such as Denmark and Sweden. 
Looking beyond OPDIVO, we are particularly encouraged to see Yervoy return to growth during the quarter, with sales of $285 million, up over last year and sequentially. 
The quarter saw stabilized sales trends outside the U.S. and an increase in U.S. sales, driven by higher demand for the regimen in metastatic disease and adoption of Yervoy in the adjuvant setting. All of this is in addition to a favorable inventory build of about $26 million. 
While the regimen continues to do well in the U.S., we are also seeing increased adoption of the regimen internationally. For example, during the quarter, roughly 40% of first-line melanoma patients in Germany were receiving the regimen. 
Let me now turn to ELIQUIS. We reported a strong quarter for ELIQUIS with sales of $884 million, up 90% compared to the same period last year and up 14% compared with Q2. Not only does ELIQUIS continue to be the #1 new-to-brand NOAC in the U.S. and other markets, but this quarter, ELIQUIS has also emerged as the leader in NBRx in the U.S. for the broader oral anticoagulant market. With U.S. sales over $500 million this quarter, ELIQUIS has established a considerable lead in terms of new-to-brand share of AFib and BTE with 51% share compared with 42% for XARELTO. 
Outside the U.S., we also saw solid growth, with sales of $372 million, up 68% compared to last year. ELIQUIS is now the leading NOAC in new-to-brand scripts with cardiologists in 6 countries in the EU. 
Our hep C portfolio delivered solid performance, with sales of $379 million in the quarter. However, as we expected, the U.S. business has been under pressure following the launch of EPCLUSA in June. U.S. sales were $192 million, which is down $100 million from Q2. We expect an additional step-down in demand in the U.S. in January when new formularies will likely prioritize EPCLUSA. As we saw with the rapid decline in our Japanese business, we expect an impact on the rest of our international business once access is secured for EPCLUSA. 
Now I'd like to highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin continues to be strongly influenced by mix. During the quarter, it was down 170 basis points compared to Q2. This is mainly due to strong sales of ELIQUIS and lower revenue from hep C. Given that we expect these trends in our product mix to persist, we would expect our gross margin to be impacted going forward. 
Other income and expense was up approximately $150 million versus prior year and continues to benefit from royalties we now receive on Erbitux.  
Based on our strong performance, we are adjusting upward our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. Our view on revenue is favorable given the trends we are seeing in the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we view our gross margin to be slightly lower primarily due to product mix, somewhat offset by FX. 
Today, we've provided 2017 guidance, which takes into account the current strong business trends that we expect will support continued earnings growth through next year. As Giovanni mentioned, our view on 2017 assumes continued growth of OPDIVO, both internationally and in the U.S. As is our normal practice, we will provide full line item guidance in January. 
As we look to the future, we feel very confident about the company's opportunities for continued growth. We are not providing any guidance beyond 2017, but as Giovanni said, our strategy continues to guide how we think about our future. We see tremendous opportunities in our I-O pipeline and are advancing our specialty portfolio. We are committed to putting resources where we can deliver the greatest value. We are evolving the company's operating model and believe these changes will help drive the company's continued success in the near and long term. 
Giovanni mentioned that we expect non-GAAP OpEx to remain flat through 2020, but this is not across the board. Our focus is on prioritizing resources where we see the greatest opportunity. For example, we expect to increase our investment in R&D in 2017, but that requires us to prioritize and drive efficiencies in other areas. 
I'll finish up on capital allocation. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation and have significant financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet. Business development remains our top priority, and we have also demonstrated our commitment to the dividend with 7 consecutive years of increases. Our board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase, providing for additional flexibility to buy back our shares. We hope to begin executing the 10b5-1 plan as soon as this year and expect to repurchase $200 million to $300 million per quarter. We believe this approach gives us the appropriate flexibility moving forward. 
Now let me pass it back to John."

We see ELIQUIS continuing to grow and continue to make inroads in terms of market shares in the U.S. and internationally. We see continued strong performance from our [indiscernible] business with OPDIVO -- sorry, with ORENCIA and Sprycel. And we do see strong momentum globally with OPDIVO, which includes, clearly, the 3 big areas we look at when we look at our business: the international launches that are progressing extremely well; and expansion of our business across multiple indications in the U.S.; and then obviously, the lung business, which, as Charlie said, will be under some pressure. When we look at the totality of those dynamics, we feel fairly confident in the ability of OPDIVO to continue to grow and in the outlook for the total business."

When we think about where we are currently in lung, we feel, obviously, very good about performance to date with roughly 60% to 70% share overall in [indiscernible] and second-line lung. Now clearly, we're going to have competitive pressure with both the approval of pembro in first-line and the reduction of that population of I-O-treated patients from the eligible second-line pool. That will be somewhat rate limited by testing. We do anticipate that there will be an acceleration in the testing rate, but there's still a slope to that curve, and that -- while Merck will rapidly penetrate that patient population, there will be a certain cadence to how that will occur because of the testing rates. Testing rates right now are about 50%, and we have seen a slight acceleration in that rate more recently. When we think about the second-line opportunity, we continue to feel very good about our profile on the basis of -017 and -057, but clearly, second-line shares are going to be under pressure from the advent of Roche in the second-line setting. The one thing I'll just clarify is while Merck were able to secure a label update in second-line at the greater-than-1% cutoff, that information was included in NCCN compendia for many, many months now, so that's not necessarily a new competitive event for us in second-line. Overall, some of the things that we continue to feel good about in second-line are just our competitiveness from a share voice as well as the breadth of indications across OPDIVO. So while we expect some share pressure in second-line and lung, other sources of growth are other indications, namely the advancement of the regimen in melanoma, and that offers a 40% share in first-line melanoma across both -- in both types of patients, BRAF-positive and mutant. Renal cell carcinoma, our business continues to do well there. We're hopeful that we'll have a head and neck indication soon. And then next year, hopefully, also bladder in the U.S. As Giovanni mentioned, we're also very pleased with the expansion of our business outside the U.S., where the clear demand trends are very good post-reimbursement events. You can't see all of that in our revenue. As Charlie mentioned, we're deferring sales in France and Germany in the quarter. But really, our shares are upwards of 70% overall PD-1 dollar market outside the U.S. So really, we're feeling good about our very balanced growth portfolio in I-O. And last but not least, it was mentioned by Charlie, Yervoy has returned to growth in the U.S. And in both France and Germany, where we have the regimen reimbursed, we've seen very good evolution there, too."

Just to talk for a moment about CheckMate -568, just to remind you that it's a single-arm study looking at the combination of Yervoy and OPDIVO in first-line lung. The primary endpoint here is response rates, and it gives us a lot of flexibility to look when and how often we look at the data. And I think we see it as complementary to the CheckMate -012 data. It's particularly useful to provide some information on current and future medical practice, particularly within IO-IO combination. We believe it will be helpful in categorizing the high response rates we saw in CheckMate -012, and importantly, it's evaluating the same dose as we've got in CheckMate -227.

As we, both Charlie and I, mentioned, continuing to evolve the way we allocate resources in the company is really driven by the opportunities we see in the portfolio. As we've said in the past, when you look at the next 3 to 5 years, we have a great opportunity for growth, which is really driven by the performance of our immuno-oncology franchise, with OPDIVO and Yervoy and ELIQUIS as significant drivers of growth. So that opportunity is quite significant. It's really concentrated in terms of the therapeutic areas and also quite concentrated in the top 20 markets around the world. At the same time, we are advancing an early pipeline, which continues to make progress. In that pipeline, as time advances, there are programs that are emerging. It's very high-potential programs, and we are ready to make the investment decisions needed in order to accelerate those programs as the data evolves. As I commented earlier also, we do see continued opportunity to streamline our G&A, to streamline our infrastructure, to look at our manufacturing network all the time, driven by our portfolio.

Based on this and based on the nature of the data we have from OPDIVO plus Yervoy and the long-term follow-up that we disclosed recently for the combination of these 2 agents and from CheckMate -012, we believe that CheckMate -227 has potential to fulfill this criteria. Specifically, when you look at Yervoy, which is a [indiscernible]-depleting agent, optimally spaced every 6 weeks with OPDIVO, this is really becoming probably or potentially a solid backbone moving forward. We view this not only in lung cancer, but we view this combination of immunotherapy agents also working and active in a variety of cancer. I would finish by saying that each time we added a CTLA-4 blockade with Yervoy to PD-1 OPDIVO, we have seen the activity increase and almost doubling in a variety of cancer with -- importantly, with a long durability of the effect."

And in the event of it, this was compounded by unfavorable patient selection and imbalances, as you mentioned, particularly, actually, that exploratory 50% cutoff. Now this is a view we -- is now supported by a number of lung and statistical experts we've consulted. And basically, we agree with the opinion of Dr. Socinski, that -- recall, the presenter of the CheckMate -026 that had the KEYNOTE-024 design being used with OPDIVO rather than KEYTRUDA. The result would likely have been similar. So as we shift our focus towards CheckMate -227, we're confident that not only the profile of OPDIVO-Yervoy regimen but the lessons we've learned from -026, and I'll ask Fouad to give you some of those very specifics, when applied to -227, will actually allow for a much better chance of success."

So first and foremost, going in, in -227 with the combination data is different. Level of activity that we have seen in monotherapy in -026 is higher response rate, is much longer PFS with a solid follow-up at this time and an improved safety profile from what we knew in the regimen before. Actually, we allowed the study in the expressor to continue to recruit, and as I said earlier, it's nearing probably 2 to 3 weeks' time before finishing the recruitment with a larger number of patients than initially planned. And we would expect in the 3 arms, that the size will be nearly doubling what we have seen in CheckMate -026. So this in itself is important to correct for the imbalances, the way we look at it. And I would add, obviously, one more thing that is different in -227 is we did not bid in a crossover like we did in CheckMate -026. And as practical matter, it means that patients that have been randomized into chemotherapy can receive the appropriate standard of care, including PD-1 monotherapy, in second-line and where it is commercially available. However, it's important to note that patients will not receive the regimen of OPDIVO-Yervoy when the tumor progress."

And I'm just curious to know what your thoughts on that is and how that's going to play out. Also just going back to Seamus' question, I think one of the other issues, too, with CheckMate -026 and KEYNOTE-024 is that both trials are recruiting around the same time, and there was a lot of overlap in clinical trial sites. You guys ended up with the B patients. They got the A patients. Is that a risk with MYSTIC and CheckMate -227? I mean, obviously, AstraZeneca is running their own IO-IO trial. And what are you doing just to avoid that? I mean, you sort of answered it, but do you have any control over the recruitment of imbalances in patients?

So the 3-week versus 2-week tends to be an issue that is considered later in the treatment consideration. So the first consideration is obviously efficacy, where the profile of OPDIVO is very strong across all histologies and across all types of PD-L1 expression. And then the other thing that's really influencing treatment decision-making is the breadth of indications that we are now developing for OPDIVO. And then I would say the dosing cadence comes into consideration. I'd also stress that in the community setting in the United States, in particular, the dosing interval of 2-week versus 3-week tends not to be an issue."

We think second-line retesting will be a small percentage of patients. I will say, though, we have been focusing on the second-line tested patients and making sure that oncologists understand the strength of our data in high expressing second-line patients from -017 and -057, and we have seen significant increases in our share of that population in second-line.

I personally think about the lung market particularly when it comes to first-line as a very dynamic market, where, obviously, in '17, there will be the use of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in high expressors. But ultimately, beginning in '18 and could be going forward, I believe it is clear that this will be a combination market.

This is probably telling us that in the squamous biology of very inflamed tumor, that, that's the type of tumor that respond to a PD-1 agent. In the non-squamous, there are tumor that are inflamed, and there are some groups that really see probably some level of inflammation like the squamous. Given -- and this could be detected by enriching in the PD-L1 biomarker and to have other marker of the inflammation in the non-squamous. In -026, really, we're broad. We were -- we stratified to the 5% cutoff.

We've quantified how we can do that more and better today, and my perspective is that from an R&D point of view, it really is about having the resources necessary in order to invest in the highest-potential programs. So I would not characterize that as having raised the hurdle. I would characterize that as having the ability to allocate the right resources to R&D in order to accelerate promising programs. And as Charlie mentioned, as an example, next year, we are increasing R&D spend because we see very strong momentum in the early pipeline and clearly, with OPDIVO and Yervoy. Clearly, on the same side -- the same level commercially, we built very competitive commercial organizations in the key markets, and that, we continue to be really committed to. It's really about disproportionate resource allocation to the highest priority areas. And there will be parts of the company, in fact, that grow or experience very little change, while we will be making decisions to reduce our focus in parts of the company like, for example, some of the G&A functions where we think we can become a leaner organization, actually accelerating the ability to execute at the same time."

We have taken them out of our second-line pool of eligible patients. And I would say it's very likely, given the clarity of the NCCN compendium and the clarity of the pembrolizumab indications, that the pretreated or first-line-treated patient population will be very close to the label, greater-than-50% expression, and so that limits the pool of previously I-O-treated patients that get excluded from second-line, at least quite a large pool of second-line patients that are still eligible for OPDIVO treatment in the second-line."

We have really interesting programs in fibrosis, immunoscience very broadly, some activity in the genetically defined disease areas with a couple of interesting programs, and that's really where we're focused. And for the -568 question, as Francis mentioned earlier, this is a single-arm trial looking at Yervoy plus OPDIVO in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, primarily at the response rate and which provide us with a lot of flexibility on when we look at the data and how often because it's an open single-arm -- open-label, single-arm study. The increasing enrollment will provide us with more data for the spectrum of PD-L1 expression, in particular, in the non-expressors and at the highly expressing patients. We view CheckMate -568 as being really complementary to CheckMate -012, and single-arm studies can help inform the current and future medical practice, as you mentioned and Francis mentioned earlier.

We have been seeing a lot of therapies, whether it is TKIs or chemotherapy shrinking tumor, shrinking cancer, and fortunately for a certain period of time, and then the tumor grows again because of that short durability. Now our experience with immunotherapy, in particular, with combination immunotherapy agents like OPDIVO and Yervoy, when patients respond, they really respond for a very long period of time. And when I say a very long period of time, if you look at our data overall, we've not even reached median of duration of response. And why we look at that and why that's important because that's really a good surrogate for improvement of survival. And improvement of survival is an important endpoint, to look at it for lung cancer, because that's what basically we'll be looking at, at the end. So the more we see patients continuing to respond to our combination of immunotherapy, the more we think there's a potential to really show long-term survival in a variety of cancer patients."

We have a lot to talk about this morning, so I'll start by summarizing my views on the performance in the quarter and then turn to our guidance for '16 and our thinking about 2017. I'll share some thoughts about our long-term strategy and then hand it over to Charlie to provide additional details about our performance and operations. 
So to begin, we just finished another very good quarter. Our business fundamentals are strong, as evidenced by our commercial performance. We delivered $4.9 billion in revenues, a full 21% increase over last year, thanks to good business trends across our portfolio. We made important regulatory advances with OPDIVO. We received a positive advisory opinion for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in Europe. Our application for advanced bladder cancer has been accepted for priority review in the U.S. and validated in Europe. And in the next few weeks, we expect to get a decision on our application for OPDIVO for head and neck cancer in the U.S. 
We had disappointing results from CheckMate -026. The results of this trial do not, however, change our strategy. We've applied learnings from the trial to our entire development program, and we are advancing a broad set of opportunities for OPDIVO. We see an even more important role for combinations, continue to be excited by the longer-term follow-up from Study -012 and believe Study -227 has the potential to bring real value to patients. 
More generally, we remain fully confident in our OPDIVO development program, which is both broad and promising, with data expected from 8 potentially registrational trials over the next 12 months. And based on our current assumptions for '17, we expect OPDIVO sales to grow globally as well as in the U.S. The trends are good, and we feel optimistic about OPDIVO in both the short and the long term. 
In light of our overall strong company performance, we are increasing our '16 non-GAAP EPS guidance to between $2.80 and $2.90. Based on our current assumptions, we expect '17 non-GAAP EPS to be between $2.85 and $3.05. 
Looking forward, I believe that we are very well positioned for sustainable growth, which, over the next 3 to 5 years, will be driven primarily by ELIQUIS, OPDIVO and Yervoy. Beyond that, we expect our overall marketed products to continue to grow, and we are excited about our early-stage pipeline and the progress it is making. 
Our strategy continues to guide how we think about the future and our long-term growth, and we are always looking at how we can stay ahead of the curve. Over the past year, we have started work on an evolution of our operating model in order to ensure we increasingly focus our resources on our highest priorities, both from an R&D perspective as well as commercially. So we continue to effectively deliver on the potential of our business. To be clear, this process was started early in 2016, and I discussed this with our employees in June. I am excited with the results of our work and confident we can be even more competitive while effectively managing our total expenses. 
Let me say a little more. As a company that has continually evolved, we are committed to operating in a way that puts resources against our most critical priorities. Over the next 18 months, we will evolve our operating model in 4 areas. We will prioritize resources to focus even more on a core set of key brands and a core set of key markets positioned to drive growth over time. For example, there are about 20 markets which are critical for us, and we will continue to invest to be very competitive commercially. 
We will continue investing in R&D to ensure a sustainable pipeline of transformational medicines. We are improving our capabilities in R&D to ensure speed, adaptability and flexibility. We will focus on accelerating development and delivery of our most promising assets. As an example, our R&D spend will increase in '17 versus '16. 
We have made significant progress optimizing our manufacturing network, and we'll continue to evolve it in line with our portfolio. Biologics are now about 75% of our development portfolio, so we will continue to invest in our biologics capabilities, as evidenced by our recent investments in Devens and Cruiserath. At the same time, we will realign, streamline and simplify our small molecule supply network. 
We will have a more streamlined G&A, more strategically aligned through the focused way we will run our business. My expectation is that with a more streamlined infrastructure, we will be a more focused and nimble company, better positioned to deliver in the short and long term, better equipped to deliver our transformational portfolio of medicines. And we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to remain flat at '16 levels through 2020. 
While transforming our company, we will continue to drive strong R&D execution and commercial performance. We know the importance of operating on 2 fronts, today and tomorrow, and that is exactly what we've been doing. 
And finally, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, with the commitment to the dividend and business development as a priority. Importantly, our board has unanimously approved an incremental $3 billion share repurchase authorization, and Charlie will comment on this in his remarks. 
But before handing the floor over to him, I just want to underscore how personally excited I am about all we are doing to build our future. And as we set our sights on the future, we see even greater possibilities for Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
So with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. This was indeed an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance.

This was indeed an outstanding quarter operationally for the company, and that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. 
We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21% sales growth and an almost doubling of EPS compared to Q3 last year.  Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we saw strong commercial execution in the quarter. Let me provide some color. OPDIVO demand remains strong. In the U.S., we recorded $712 million of sales, up 11% sequentially. OPDIVO-based therapy has become established as standard of care in the U.S. across melanoma, renal cell and second-line non-small cell lung cancer. While our second-line lung business will be under some pressure, we believe we have opportunities for growth in renal, melanoma and Hodgkin's as well as future indications such as bladder and head and neck. In addition, over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see important readouts for several tumor types that we believe will position the brand for further growth. 
Outside the U.S., we recorded $208 million for OPDIVO during the quarter. This does not include approximately $150 million of gross sales for France and Germany in the quarter, which are being deferred. The amount we will actually recognize depends on the final price in each country, and we do expect to reach an agreement for both later this year. 
From an operational perspective, we continue to see strong adoption in markets where OPDIVO had been launched. For example, we continue to see 70% to 80% of PD-1 share in France and Germany. We have also made good progress this quarter securing reimbursement among key EU markets such as Denmark and Sweden. 
Looking beyond OPDIVO, we are particularly encouraged to see Yervoy return to growth during the quarter, with sales of $285 million, up over last year and sequentially. 
The quarter saw stabilized sales trends outside the U.S. and an increase in U.S. sales, driven by higher demand for the regimen in metastatic disease and adoption of Yervoy in the adjuvant setting. All of this is in addition to a favorable inventory build of about $26 million. 
While the regimen continues to do well in the U.S., we are also seeing increased adoption of the regimen internationally. For example, during the quarter, roughly 40% of first-line melanoma patients in Germany were receiving the regimen. 
Let me now turn to ELIQUIS. We reported a strong quarter for ELIQUIS with sales of $884 million, up 90% compared to the same period last year and up 14% compared with Q2. Not only does ELIQUIS continue to be the #1 new-to-brand NOAC in the U.S. and other markets, but this quarter, ELIQUIS has also emerged as the leader in NBRx in the U.S. for the broader oral anticoagulant market. With U.S. sales over $500 million this quarter, ELIQUIS has established a considerable lead in terms of new-to-brand share of AFib and BTE with 51% share compared with 42% for XARELTO. 
Outside the U.S., we also saw solid growth, with sales of $372 million, up 68% compared to last year. ELIQUIS is now the leading NOAC in new-to-brand scripts with cardiologists in 6 countries in the EU. 
Our hep C portfolio delivered solid performance, with sales of $379 million in the quarter. However, as we expected, the U.S. business has been under pressure following the launch of EPCLUSA in June. U.S. sales were $192 million, which is down $100 million from Q2. We expect an additional step-down in demand in the U.S. in January when new formularies will likely prioritize EPCLUSA. As we saw with the rapid decline in our Japanese business, we expect an impact on the rest of our international business once access is secured for EPCLUSA. 
Now I'd like to highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin continues to be strongly influenced by mix. During the quarter, it was down 170 basis points compared to Q2. This is mainly due to strong sales of ELIQUIS and lower revenue from hep C. Given that we expect these trends in our product mix to persist, we would expect our gross margin to be impacted going forward. 
Other income and expense was up approximately $150 million versus prior year and continues to benefit from royalties we now receive on Erbitux.  
Based on our strong performance, we are adjusting upward our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. Our view on revenue is favorable given the trends we are seeing in the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we view our gross margin to be slightly lower primarily due to product mix, somewhat offset by FX. 
Today, we've provided 2017 guidance, which takes into account the current strong business trends that we expect will support continued earnings growth through next year. As Giovanni mentioned, our view on 2017 assumes continued growth of OPDIVO, both internationally and in the U.S. As is our normal practice, we will provide full line item guidance in January. 
As we look to the future, we feel very confident about the company's opportunities for continued growth. We are not providing any guidance beyond 2017, but as Giovanni said, our strategy continues to guide how we think about our future. We see tremendous opportunities in our I-O pipeline and are advancing our specialty portfolio. We are committed to putting resources where we can deliver the greatest value. We are evolving the company's operating model and believe these changes will help drive the company's continued success in the near and long term. 
Giovanni mentioned that we expect non-GAAP OpEx to remain flat through 2020, but this is not across the board. Our focus is on prioritizing resources where we see the greatest opportunity. For example, we expect to increase our investment in R&D in 2017, but that requires us to prioritize and drive efficiencies in other areas. 
I'll finish up on capital allocation. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation and have significant financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet. Business development remains our top priority, and we have also demonstrated our commitment to the dividend with 7 consecutive years of increases. Our board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase, providing for additional flexibility to buy back our shares. We hope to begin executing the 10b5-1 plan as soon as this year and expect to repurchase $200 million to $300 million per quarter. We believe this approach gives us the appropriate flexibility moving forward. 
Now let me pass it back to John."

I believe several of your OPDIVO indications have been either filed or approved based on single-arm Phase II studies, I think like Hodgkins as an example. How do we think about, just maybe more broadly, indications that you would be able to file on Phase II data versus indications where you're going to need fully controlled studies? Is this the size of the indication? Is it the lack of a standard of care, the existing therapies? Is it the strength of the data? I just want to put in context what we need to think about to look at Phase II data versus the broader Phase III programs."

When we think about '17, obviously, we look at the totality of our business. There are very strong trends for our business, as you saw in Q3. We see ELIQUIS continuing to grow and continue to make inroads in terms of market shares in the U.S. and internationally. We see continued strong performance from our [indiscernible] business with OPDIVO -- sorry, with ORENCIA and Sprycel. And we do see strong momentum globally with OPDIVO, which includes, clearly, the 3 big areas we look at when we look at our business: the international launches that are progressing extremely well; and expansion of our business across multiple indications in the U.S.; and then obviously, the lung business, which, as Charlie said, will be under some pressure. When we look at the totality of those dynamics, we feel fairly confident in the ability of OPDIVO to continue to grow and in the outlook for the total business."

When we think about where we are currently in lung, we feel, obviously, very good about performance to date with roughly 60% to 70% share overall in [indiscernible] and second-line lung. Now clearly, we're going to have competitive pressure with both the approval of pembro in first-line and the reduction of that population of I-O-treated patients from the eligible second-line pool. That will be somewhat rate limited by testing. We do anticipate that there will be an acceleration in the testing rate, but there's still a slope to that curve, and that -- while Merck will rapidly penetrate that patient population, there will be a certain cadence to how that will occur because of the testing rates. Testing rates right now are about 50%, and we have seen a slight acceleration in that rate more recently. When we think about the second-line opportunity, we continue to feel very good about our profile on the basis of -017 and -057, but clearly, second-line shares are going to be under pressure from the advent of Roche in the second-line setting. The one thing I'll just clarify is while Merck were able to secure a label update in second-line at the greater-than-1% cutoff, that information was included in NCCN compendia for many, many months now, so that's not necessarily a new competitive event for us in second-line. Overall, some of the things that we continue to feel good about in second-line are just our competitiveness from a share voice as well as the breadth of indications across OPDIVO. So while we expect some share pressure in second-line and lung, other sources of growth are other indications, namely the advancement of the regimen in melanoma, and that offers a 40% share in first-line melanoma across both -- in both types of patients, BRAF-positive and mutant. Renal cell carcinoma, our business continues to do well there. We're hopeful that we'll have a head and neck indication soon. And then next year, hopefully, also bladder in the U.S. As Giovanni mentioned, we're also very pleased with the expansion of our business outside the U.S., where the clear demand trends are very good post-reimbursement events. You can't see all of that in our revenue. As Charlie mentioned, we're deferring sales in France and Germany in the quarter. But really, our shares are upwards of 70% overall PD-1 dollar market outside the U.S. So really, we're feeling good about our very balanced growth portfolio in I-O. And last but not least, it was mentioned by Charlie, Yervoy has returned to growth in the U.S. And in both France and Germany, where we have the regimen reimbursed, we've seen very good evolution there, too."

Just to talk for a moment about CheckMate -568, just to remind you that it's a single-arm study looking at the combination of Yervoy and OPDIVO in first-line lung. The primary endpoint here is response rates, and it gives us a lot of flexibility to look when and how often we look at the data. And I think we see it as complementary to the CheckMate -012 data. It's particularly useful to provide some information on current and future medical practice, particularly within IO-IO combination. We believe it will be helpful in categorizing the high response rates we saw in CheckMate -012, and importantly, it's evaluating the same dose as we've got in CheckMate -227.

As we, both Charlie and I, mentioned, continuing to evolve the way we allocate resources in the company is really driven by the opportunities we see in the portfolio. As we've said in the past, when you look at the next 3 to 5 years, we have a great opportunity for growth, which is really driven by the performance of our immuno-oncology franchise, with OPDIVO and Yervoy and ELIQUIS as significant drivers of growth. So that opportunity is quite significant. It's really concentrated in terms of the therapeutic areas and also quite concentrated in the top 20 markets around the world. At the same time, we are advancing an early pipeline, which continues to make progress. In that pipeline, as time advances, there are programs that are emerging. It's very high-potential programs, and we are ready to make the investment decisions needed in order to accelerate those programs as the data evolves. As I commented earlier also, we do see continued opportunity to streamline our G&A, to streamline our infrastructure, to look at our manufacturing network all the time, driven by our portfolio.

Based on this and based on the nature of the data we have from OPDIVO plus Yervoy and the long-term follow-up that we disclosed recently for the combination of these 2 agents and from CheckMate -012, we believe that CheckMate -227 has potential to fulfill this criteria. Specifically, when you look at Yervoy, which is a [indiscernible]-depleting agent, optimally spaced every 6 weeks with OPDIVO, this is really becoming probably or potentially a solid backbone moving forward. We view this not only in lung cancer, but we view this combination of immunotherapy agents also working and active in a variety of cancer. I would finish by saying that each time we added a CTLA-4 blockade with Yervoy to PD-1 OPDIVO, we have seen the activity increase and almost doubling in a variety of cancer with -- importantly, with a long durability of the effect."

Level of activity that we have seen in monotherapy in -026 is higher response rate, is much longer PFS with a solid follow-up at this time and an improved safety profile from what we knew in the regimen before. Actually, we allowed the study in the expressor to continue to recruit, and as I said earlier, it's nearing probably 2 to 3 weeks' time before finishing the recruitment with a larger number of patients than initially planned. And we would expect in the 3 arms, that the size will be nearly doubling what we have seen in CheckMate -026. So this in itself is important to correct for the imbalances, the way we look at it. And I would add, obviously, one more thing that is different in -227 is we did not bid in a crossover like we did in CheckMate -026. And as practical matter, it means that patients that have been randomized into chemotherapy can receive the appropriate standard of care, including PD-1 monotherapy, in second-line and where it is commercially available.

So the first consideration is obviously efficacy, where the profile of OPDIVO is very strong across all histologies and across all types of PD-L1 expression.

We see -- first of all, our evolution of the operating model is very consistent in a way with what we've been discussing with all of you over the last few months in terms of allocating resources strategically, accelerating the pipeline and generating the right leverage as we grow as a company. We've quantified how we can do that more and better today, and my perspective is that from an R&D point of view, it really is about having the resources necessary in order to invest in the highest-potential programs. So I would not characterize that as having raised the hurdle. I would characterize that as having the ability to allocate the right resources to R&D in order to accelerate promising programs. And as Charlie mentioned, as an example, next year, we are increasing R&D spend because we see very strong momentum in the early pipeline and clearly, with OPDIVO and Yervoy. Clearly, on the same side -- the same level commercially, we built very competitive commercial organizations in the key markets, and that, we continue to be really committed to. It's really about disproportionate resource allocation to the highest priority areas. And there will be parts of the company, in fact, that grow or experience very little change, while we will be making decisions to reduce our focus in parts of the company like, for example, some of the G&A functions where we think we can become a leaner organization, actually accelerating the ability to execute at the same time."

What we've seen in the market to date has been really very predictable in terms of what the oncologists and payers are doing, is they're responding to data events that trigger NCCN guidelines and compendia updates and also are respectful of the labeled indications of the products. So I would say in our forecast, we have not assumed any retreatment of pembrolizumab first-line-exposed patients in our second-line opportunity. We have taken them out of our second-line pool of eligible patients. And I would say it's very likely, given the clarity of the NCCN compendium and the clarity of the pembrolizumab indications, that the pretreated or first-line-treated patient population will be very close to the label, greater-than-50% expression, and so that limits the pool of previously I-O-treated patients that get excluded from second-line, at least quite a large pool of second-line patients that are still eligible for OPDIVO treatment in the second-line."

And when I say a very long period of time, if you look at our data overall, we've not even reached median of duration of response. And why we look at that and why that's important because that's really a good surrogate for improvement of survival. And improvement of survival is an important endpoint, to look at it for lung cancer, because that's what basically we'll be looking at, at the end.

We've entered the period of growth I've discussed before with 17% sales growth in the second quarter compared to last year. In fact, sales growth was 24%, excluding the impact from Abilify and Erbitux.
On a non-GAAP basis, our EPS of $0.69 represents a growth of 30% versus last year.
I will share a few of our highlights, and Charlie will then provide more details.
Starting with Eliquis, global sales grew 78% from a year ago as we continued to make progress towards our goal of becoming the #1 novel anticoagulant.
In the U.S., the second quarter continued the trend of strong Eliquis' performance. Our both AFib and BTE, Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in total prescriptions among cardiologists and new-to-brand prescriptions across all physicians.
Outside the U.S., Eliquis is the #1 novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions in Japan and the #1 NOAC in cardiology across a growing number of markets.  We continue to see strong demand trends from key markets across the globe.
At the upcoming ESC Congress in August, we will be presenting additional real world data supporting the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus other NOACs.
Regarding immuno-oncology, we've made great progress in transforming cancer care with more than 80 global approvals around the world, including 9 approved indications in the U.S. in less than 2 years. I am very proud of our accomplishments, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational in a standard of care within its approved indications.
We continue to see strong execution from our R&D and commercial organizations. During the quarter, we saw strong sales performance for both Opdivo and Yervoy with Opdivo growing 19% worldwide quarter-over-quarter.
In the U.S., Opdivo sales were led by lung and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, Yervoy grew 32% versus last year as the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen became the single most prescribed therapy in first-line metastatic melanoma in the U.S.
In Germany, we have seen strong uptake in first-line melanoma and second-line non-small cell lung cancer.
In France, we have approximately 80% of the PD-1 market. We're not yet recording revenues there as formal reimbursement has not been obtained, and we are operating under an ATU [ph].
In Japan, Opdivo became the largest oncology brand in June.
With respect to R&D, Opdivo is now approved in 54 markets worldwide, and we made some excellent progress in the second quarter.
In the EU, Opdivo was approved for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and received expanded approvals for use in pretreated renal patients as well as broad use in pretreated non-squamous lung patients.
The FDA granted a sixth breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for the potential use in previously treated patients with unresectable bladder cancer.
And just last week, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency validated applications for the use of Opdivo in the treatment of head and neck cancer.
ASCO was a very important meeting for us. We presented broad data across 13 types of cancers, reinforcing our commitment to addressing significant unmet needs in a wide range of tumors.
In first-line non-small cell lung cancer, we presented unprecedented data from CheckMate -012, which strengthened our confidence that the I-O combination of Opdivo+Yervoy may improve upon long-term survival expectations for patients who express PD-L1.
In other tumors such as small cell lung cancer and MSI-high metastatic colorectal cancer, we presented encouraging data which has the potential to broaden the benefit of Opdivo+Yervoy.
And we presented encouraging new data in bladder and more mature data in hepatocellular carcinoma which speaks to the depth and breadth of our clinical program as we establish the promise of I-O in additional tumor types.
I am confident we are making all of the right investments from, both an R&D and a commercial perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.
Now before turning the floor over to Charlie, I want to highlight some news we shared earlier this week. Many of you know Fouad Namouni as he has played a critical role in our immuno-oncology strategy so far. Fouad has been appointed Head of Oncology Development, reporting directly to Francis.
In his new role, Fouad will focus on our comprehensive portfolio strategy for oncology and on driving product development plans from the early development stage to commercialization.
We also announced that after more than 17 years, Michael Giordano will be retiring from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
I want to personally thank Michael for his many contributions since joining the company. Michael and his teams have led the development and approval of more than a dozen medicines marking a successful drug development career.
Now looking ahead, I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. We have a significant opportunity for growth, driven primarily by Opdivo and Eliquis between now and 2020 and an exciting early portfolio of medicines with the potential to drive growth well beyond 2020.
Now I'll turn the floor over to Charlie for additional comments. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year.
Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02.
Let me start with a few additional comments on our sales performance. As Giovanni mentioned, Eliquis continues to do very well with Q2 sales of $777 million. We continued to see strong TRx growth trends quarter-on-quarter, some of which was offset by the work done in the quarter from the Q1 inventory building the channel as well as the higher Q2 Medicare liability.
Opdivo has become a foundational immuno-oncology agent, and that is reflective in its continued strong performance. Physician adoption of Opdivo remained strong in markets that we have launched and have reimbursement with PD-1 shares of approximately 80% in the U.S. and in key international markets. With approvals now in 54 markets, international sales for Opdivo grew to $197 million in the quarter.
Sales in the U.S. grew 8% sequentially over fourth -- first quarter, driven by strong demand growth, which was partially offset by wholesaler inventory movements of approximately $45 million.
Yervoy sales were down 19% versus last year, driven mainly by pressure internationally from the launch of PD-1 agent.
In the U.S., Yervoy was up 32% compared to last year, driven by regimen use. We expect pressure to continue internationally until we secure reimbursement over the next year following our approval of the regimen in Europe for metastatic melanoma.
Daklinza had another good quarter with sales driven mainly by strong demand in the U.S. and Europe in the genotype 3 patient population. We expect that competition from recently approved therapies will significantly impact the U.S. business in the second half of this year.
In Europe, we also expect significant impact once access is secured. 
Empliciti sales in the U.S. were $33 million as we continue to focus on gaining new trial and driving demand in very competitive relapsed/refractory market. 
Now I move to our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.3% during the quarter, down 100 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is primarily due to profit mix, including the strong performance of Eliquis and the U.S. Abilify contract expiration.
MS&A was up 9% versus last year, driven by our investments behind new brands, including Opdivo, Eliquis and Empliciti. This was partially offset by lower spend on established products.
R&D expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter. The increase in spending was primarily due to grants, Opdivo study supplies and other immuno-oncology investments.
Other income was approximately $90 million up versus prior year, which benefited from royalties we now receive on Erbitux, R&D expense reimbursements from our deal with Bev [ph] and higher diabetes royalties. This was partially offset by the write-down of our uniQure equity investment of $45 million.
As I mentioned last quarter, diabetes royalties are higher in the first half of the year due to the tiering structure of our agreement with AUD. We therefore expect overall OI&E to be slightly lower in the second half of the year.
Business development remains a key priority and a strategic source of innovation for our company. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals and their novel antibody program targeting IL-8 as well as 4 clinical collaborations that support our combination strategy for immuno-oncology.
Switching to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.55 to $2.65. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen, we now expect the impact of foreign exchange on EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07.
I know our MS&A expense was higher than many of you expected during the quarter. This was primarily due to the timing of investments behind Opdivo, and we still expect MS&A to decrease in the low-single-digit range. We now expect R&D spend to increase in the mid-teens range, driven by investments in Opdivo and other immuno-oncology programs. This also accounts for the increased spending related to business development transactions completed this year.
The effective tax rate is now expected to be 22%. 
As Giovanni mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong performance across the entirety of our company and now look forward to your questions."

Second, CTLA-4 seems to be associated with more late response and pseudoprogression that perhaps you see with PD-1. Thinking about your CheckMate-227 trial, how do we think about that within the context of PSS as a primary endpoint. Obviously, the Merck data is supported in this indication, but here we have the potential increased risk of pseudoprogression, again, just focusing on PSS. And then finally, there was some provocative data from one of your competitors in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer, non-MSI patients combining a MEK and PD-L1 agent. I think you're the only major PDX sponsor that doesn't have a MEK inhibitor in your portfolio. I understand there's a lot of opportunities, but is this now of interest and are you pursuing such combination with a MEK?"

And while we don't have an exact time line with respect to the publication of a potential final rule, obviously, that is what we are waiting for. I would say that what many stakeholders really have been concerned about is the possibility that changes that are suddenly introduced in the reimbursement mechanism for Part B products may have an impact in where patients are treated and lead to a reduced capacity to treat patients in the community, which obviously, will not be good for patients and would create significant burden for hospitals. And so that is one of the elements we will be looking for because obviously it's critically important for patients. With respect to the rule becoming voluntary, that we will have to see. Clearly, it is the timing which there are multiple other pilots in the market and therefore, a voluntary rule may enable physicians to participate in one pilot and not have a very complex set of schemes they have to operate under at the same time. So I would leave it at that."

So we don't believe there will be an impact on the way we've done our study here. Talking about CRC, we've focused on diversifying across a very broad range of differentiated mechanisms of actions in evaluating different combinations with I-O. Based on those where we have a biological rationale, in particular, tumors and particularly where we're not seeing sufficient activity with Opdivo monotherapy or Opdivo+Yervoy regimen and that would include colorectal cancer. Now as you said, Roche presented Phase I data in combination of PD-L1 in combination with the MEK inhibitor. And I agree. While the data was early and the size of study was small, the combination did appear to show activity. We continue to look for combinations both externally or internally with our several early-stage assets, which would help us to identify patient populations and mechanisms and certainly CRC is a focus for that. I would just comment that we presented in the non-stable MSI in the MSI-high patient population very interesting data, not just monotherapy, but combination at ASCO. And so there are some parts of CRC where we think our regimen will have an effect."

If we hit PFS that is greater than 1%, we can then test for OS in both strongly expressing and greater than 1%. Now just to remind you, overall survival is a secondary endpoint in CheckMate -026, and we still can still file without a positive OS result. Now the selected population of high expressers is not 50%.  So we should be able to describe the effect at 50% cut-off once our analysis is complete. And just to finish, as I've noted in the past and I'll note again today, I'm confident in the study design of -026 and I look forward to seeing the data in weeks, not months."

We're also very pleased that we are seeing similar dynamics happen in every international market in which we have obtained reimbursement and launching. And overall, we continue to maintain a very high percentage of total PD-1 sales in the 80% range. As we think about our lung cancer strategy going into first line, as Francis mentioned, we are very confident in our understanding of the disease off Opdivo and in the design of the clinical trial. And overall, I would say, in the long term, we're also very comfortable with our strategy that has a really strong pillar in monotherapy, but then over the next year or so, we'll transition into the potential use of the combination therapy.

As far as Keynote-024 is concerned, it's hard for me to comment without having the trial design and the enrollment details in terms of the crossover. Just to remind you, both studies allowed for PD-1 therapy after progression on chemo. And we're not actually aware any technical differences that will create a difference in the crossover. Now, as you know, there's always a possibility that OS may be confounded in an open trial. And that's why we paid a lot of attention to the timing of the analysis. I mentioned that over the last few months. We also made sure that the CheckMate -026 protocol that the patients on chemo were required actually to have their progression confirmed centrally before they were allowed to receive Opdivo. That's important because that reduce the amounts of wobble around that. So again, we think it's always an issue, but we think we've minimized that in terms of getting a potential result, both in terms of PFS and, of course, OS. We will, as usual, be looking for the earliest opportunity to present the data at a conference and publish it. As -- and I'll say again, we're not going to talk about the high expresser cutoff at this point. But you, obviously, will have an opportunity to see that when we talk about the data.

I would go back to what we said a few minutes ago at the beginning. Our experience is that given strong data and significant patient value, payers are providing access to combo regimens in I-O. And when you look at the evolution of combination regimens depending on the dose of different agents and the frequency of those, the incremental cost to payers is very sustainable. Because when you look at our regimen in melanoma, for example, during the phase of induction, which is the 12 weeks in which 2 products are used together, the cost of induction is only 6% higher than monotherapy. And then when you look at the regimen that we are taking into -227 of lung cancer, there is a lower dose of Yervoy, which is administered every 6 weeks. So all of that to say that at this point, we continue to think about the regimen that has the strongest data in the label and offers the most value to patients and the one that is reimbursed and one that is reimbursed by payers and adopted in the marketplace."

I believe that the doubling of response across all levels of PD-1 expression versus Opdivo monotherapy in lung cancer is studied well and was extremely promising. And we're also challenging ourselves, and we have challenged ourselves to find the regimens that are tolerable, which we believe we have with the new regimen in lung. At the same time, we are taking this combination regimen to many more tumor types, and the data continues to be extremely promising.

Yes, I am confident, and we've done everything to do that. I really think the -- I think there's another part, which I will take opportunity to the call out of our development regulatory and filing teams because I think there's another dimension to this which is the speed aspect. And as you said, 2 years ago, we were wondering how we deal with everything. Now I think we've seen these teams deliver 9 approved indications in 18 months. And what would be an exceptional performance for anyone else is to become norm for these folks. And I just know they're relishing the opportunity to get their hands on the data for -026 and to maintain or even exceed the performance they've already done. So it's a very -- they're very excited team, and we're very confident that they made to move this quickly forward. Thanks, Mark."

We've got a portfolio of now about 15 assets from preclinical through to mid stage then you can have the potential to be first or best-in-class.

Our areas of focus for business development, which as we mentioned at the beginning, remains a really important priority of the company, are really the therapeutic areas, in which we decided to focus our internal R&D efforts.

Those are the areas in which our business development teams are acting.
So with that, let me close the call, and thank all of you for participating. Again, we had a very strong quarter.
