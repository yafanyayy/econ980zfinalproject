Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby, President; Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; and Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs. 
As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and 2015 financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some details on the -- on our 2016 guidance. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from those comments, we will open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media. 
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found on our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com. A webcast of this will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.
So thanks again for joining us this morning, and at this point, we'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker."

We're pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results for 2015. It's hard to imagine that just 2 years ago, this American Airlines was emerging from bankruptcy, but we were. In the first year, the company produced record profits of $4.2 billion, including special items that with the record that we set in 2014, which was more than double that American ever made in its past. This year, we've exceeded that with the results we released today of $6.3 billion. So a new record beating last year's record for the quarter, a new record of $1.3 billion exceeding last. This is all the result of incredibly hard work and great work by 100,000 employees doing phenomenal job at taking care of customers while we work through an integration, particularly the integration. Just a year ago, the big concern was whether with -- was how much disruption might put upon its customers as we work through integration everyone's have in the past and had difficulties our team had been barred the park. Accomplishing things like frequent flyer integration single reservation system migration. All of those things done flawlessly and again, great credit to a really phenomenal team who's really doing a great job. We still have a lot to do. We're well aware that -- we are well on our way to restoring American as the greatest airline in the world. Our team is doing a phenomenal job. We should be proud of the results. They've produced and very pleased with our outlook given the positioning we have today. 
So with that said, I will turn over to Derek, who will give you a lot more details on the financials and then Scott will follow with some other details preliminary revenue related."

In our earnings release filed this morning, we reported record earnings, as Doug said, for both our fourth quarter and full year 2015, excluding net special credits, our fourth quarter net profit was $1.3 billion or",1740,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. In our earnings release filed this morning, we reported record earnings, as Doug said, for both our fourth quarter and full year 2015, excluding net special credits, our fourth quarter net profit was $1.3 billion or $2 per diluted share. This represents a $182 million improvement versus our fourth quarter 2014 net profit, excluding net special charges. Our fourth quarter 2015 pretax margin, excluding net special charges, increased 2.8 points year-over-year to a record 13.4%. Our 2015 net earnings, excluding net special credits, were up 50% year-over-year to $6.3 billion or $9.12 per diluted share. And this compares to a 2014 net profit excluding net special charges of $4.2 billion or $5.70 per diluted share. 
Our 2015 pretax margin, excluding net special charges, increased by 5.5 points to a record 15.3%. 
Total capacity for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 65.5 billion ASMs, up 0.6% from the same period in 2014, and mainline capacity for the quarter was 58.1 billion ASMs, up 0.5%. Regional capacity for the quarter was up 1.4% to 7.31 billion ASMs. 
In 2015, we did continue our fleet renewal program by investing more than $5.3 billion in new aircraft, providing the company with the youngest and most modern fleet of the U.S. network airlines. In 2015, the company took delivery of 75 new mainline aircraft while retiring 112 aircraft, and the company also added 52 regional aircraft to its fleet, while we removed 31 regional aircraft from the fleet. This program will continue in 2016 when we take delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft, while adding 49 regional aircraft. We expect to remove 92 mainline aircraft and 29 regional aircraft from our fleet in 2016. With these new deliveries, our mainline average age will drop below 10 years, further widening the age gap between American and our network peers. 
Recently, we reached an agreement with Airbus to defer 2 of the 6 2017 A350 aircraft deliveries to 2020. These deferrals should help us match the pace of wide-body deliveries to our projected needs for international flights. This new schedule still has us taking 4 A350s next year as we remain the North American launch customer. 
Our fourth quarter 2015 revenue was negatively impacted by a large capacity increases in certain domestic segments as well as weaker yields in international markets, due principally to foreign currency devaluation. Lower surcharges and continued economic softness in Latin America also contributed to the decline in revenue. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $9.6 billion, down 5.2% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $8.3 billion, down 5.4%, driven by 8.9% lower yields on a 0.6% increase in system capacity. Cargo revenues were down 17.3%, due primarily to a 15.5% decline in yields, and other operating revenues were relatively flat at $1.1 billion. 
Total RASM in the fourth quarter was $0.1471[ph], down 5.8%, driven primarily by decline in passenger RASM, which was $0.1269 [ph]. As Doug and Scott will give us more detail on our revenue performance. 
Consistent with the first 9 months of 2015, our fourth quarter financial results continue to reflect a significant savings from our -- the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. Our average mainline fuel price including taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015, was $1.50 per gallon, a 40.6% decline from $2.52 per gallon in the fourth quarter last year. Total operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 7.9% versus the same period last year, due primarily to the decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Operating expenses, excluding net special charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, were $8.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Driven by lower fuel costs, fourth quarter mainline cost per ASM, excluding special charges, was $0.1148[ph], down 8.3% year-over-year. If you exclude net special charges and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.922[ph], up 6.3%. This increase was due primarily to contractual rate increases for our new labor agreements. Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding net special charges in fuel was $0.161 [ph] for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.5%. Total consolidated CASM in the quarter was up 5.5%, due principally to the contractual labor increases, I've mentioned earlier, and the increased flyer under capacity purchase agreements. 
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $8.7 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.3 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also has a restricted cash position of $695 million. These balances reflect the full write-down of $592 million of Venezuela bolivars. 
During the fourth quarter 2015, we did generate $674 million in cash flow from operations, which is adjusted for the write-down of Venezuela bolivars and paid $332 million in scheduled debt payments. 
In the fourth quarter, the company returned approximately $1.2 billion to its shareholders through the payment of $72 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.1 billion of common stock or 25.6 million shares. When combined with the dividends and share repurchases during the first 3 quarters of 2015, the company returned approximately $3.9 billion to its shareholders in 2015 and reduced its shares outstanding by 85.1 million shares. In addition, in 2015, the company elected to pay approximately $306 million to cover employee tax withholding obligations on equity awards, further reducing the share count by 7 million. 
Despite volatility in the capital markets during January 2016, the company was able to secure attractive financing rates to fund a portion of its aircraft deliveries. Earlier this month, the company issued approximately $1.1 billion in enhanced equivalent trust certificates at a blended coupon of just under 4%. The proceeds from this financing were used to fund aircraft deliveries in 2015. 
As we indicated on our third quarter call, we would like to provide you with our views on liquidity and leverage. Looking forward, 2016 and '17 will be a peak period for capital expenditures as we spent approximately $4.5 billion on our fleet renewal program. Beginning in 2018, however, our aircraft CapEx will decline from $4.5 billion to approximately $3 billion each year. Our 2016 and '17 nonaircraft CapEx guidance is $1.2 billion each year, and we expect this to decline to an annual rate of approximately $800 million, starting in 2018, as we complete integration of our internal systems. 
In today's earnings and interest rate environment, liquidity is the first and most important metric we look at. We ended the year with $8.7 billion in available liquidity, which is more than we believe is required to run the airline. But given our leverage, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers, so we plan to maintain an industry-leading liquidity level of at least $6.5 billion for the foreseeable future. 
As to leverage, under our current plan, we expect our primary metrics such as net debt to EBITDAR to peak in 2016 and then begin declining each year going forward as our CapEx budget declines. 
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We're forecasting overall system schedule capacity growth to be up approximately 3%, with full year domestic capacity growth of approximately 2%, while international capacity is expected to be up approximately 6%, primarily growth in the Pacific. 
By quarter, mainline capacity breaks down as follows: 57.4 billion ASMs in the first quarter, 63.4 billion in the second, 65.1 billion in the third, and 58.8 billion in the fourth. Regional capacity each quarter is 7.48 billion in the first, 8.29 billion in the second, 8.69 billion in the third and 8.46 billion in the fourth. For the full year 2016, we are forecasting year-over-year total CASM, x special items and fuel, to be up approximately 0.5% to 2.5%. This does not include the effect of labor deals currently being negotiated, but does include all contracts that have been ratified. Mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be up approximately 1% to 3%, while regional CASM excluding special items of fuel is projected to be down 4% to 6%. By quarter, mainline CASM should be up 1% to 3% for each of the 4 quarters. Regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, we believe the first quarter to be approximately flat and the second to fourth quarter down approximately 5% to 7%. 
Based on the fuel curve as of January 27, we expect to see another year with significant fuel savings. While other airlines are just beginning to realize these savings, we have directly benefited from lower fuel prices due to our lack of fuel hedges. We are forecasting our 2016 consolidated fuel price to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25 per gallon. The first quarter is expected to be $1.15 to $1.20; of the second, $1.16 to $1.21; third, $1.21 to $1.26; and fourth, $1.25 to $1.30. While it's still very early in the year, based on these prices, we expect our 2016 consolidated fuel expense to improve by approximately $2 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of guidance, we have provided along with the PRASM guidance Scott will give, we expect our first quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 12% and 14%. 
For taxes, as of December 31, 2015, the company had approximately $8 billion of federal net operating losses and $4 billion in state NOLs. Substantially, all of which are expected to be available in 2016 to reduce future federal and state taxable income. The company expects to recognize a provision for income taxes beginning in 2016 at an effective rate of approximately 38%, which will be substantially noncash as a result of having reversed the valuation allowance at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In terms of CapEx, talked about a little bit, but we expect total gross aircraft CapEx in '16 to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion will be in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect to invest $1.2 billion in nonaircraft CapEx, which includes many investments to improve our product and operation. We also expect to make $2.4 billion in debt payments throughout the year. 
In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members. 2015 was another tremendous year for American Airlines. We successfully completed several integration milestones, made significant investments in our product, our people and our fleet, all while producing record earnings. We look forward to another great year in 2016. 
Thank you for your time, and I'll pass it over to Scott for comments on the revenue side."

And I'd like to start by thanking all the people of American Airlines for a really fantastic job they've been doing in some unusually difficult weather conditions lately. The people of AA continue to make operational progress in the fourth",552,"Thanks, Derek. And I'd like to start by thanking all the people of American Airlines for a really fantastic job they've been doing in some unusually difficult weather conditions lately. The people of AA continue to make operational progress in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015 with improvement in almost all of our operating metrics. It seems like a long time ago, but it was just during the fourth quarter that we completed the most successful reservation system cut over in airline history, so thanks again to the team. Success with that of her. And now that the rest of the migration is behind us, the team has numerous initiatives underway to further improve our operational performance for our employees and customers. 
On the revenue front, our fourth quarter PRASM was down 5.4%. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 3%, and we saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Charlotte and second-strongest domestic performance was in DFW, and that's in spite of all the capacity that's been added here. The weakest performance was in Miami, although that's really a function of declining connecting revenues coming from South America. 
Internationally, the strong U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges account for 2.4 points of our total system PRASM decline. The Atlantic was our best-performing international region, with PRASM down 7%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10%, with weakness in both Japan and China, but positive year-over-year PRASM in South Korea and Hong Kong. Latin PRASM was down 17%, but as it's been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela, where PRASM was down 40% and 59%, respectively. 
Looking forward, the factors driving year-over-year PRASM declines remain very similar to the last few quarters. Schedule capacity remains elevated in all regions, and Q1 will actually see higher capacity growth than any quarter we saw last year. 
As we move into the second quarter in the back half of the year, however, we expect capacity growth rates to moderate each quarter. While we're now overlapping some of the moves in the dollar from last year, the dollar does continue to strengthen against many currencies around the world such as the Brazilian real. We project that currency and surcharge declines will impact system PRASM by 1.7 points in Q1, which is down from the 2.4 points in Q4. 
As we experienced throughout 2015, we continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas, and we won't see that moderate until the fourth quarter. And the economy, currencies and revenue environment in Brazil and Venezuela continue to deteriorate. We still don't realistically expect any improvement in South America until the Brazilian economy turns around. Given all this, we expect our system PRASM to decline 6% to 8% year-over-year in the first quarter though, as I said, we expect to see smaller declines in 2Q and beyond. 
In conclusion, we passed a significant integration milestone in the fourth quarter. We American Airlines teams doing a great job running the airline, and we're busy making further improvements to the operation and product now that we're past that integration hurdle. Revenue environment remains challenged for the same factors that we experienced in 2015, but we expect the first quarter to mark the bottom and the rest of the year to see an inflection in revenue results."

We feel good about the trajectory that we're on in terms of getting the integration done. now that we're past the integration, it does give us the opportunity to start realizing more synergies, but also moving the ball forward in terms of our operation and in terms of revenue enhancements, doing things like economy and program all kinds of other programs. So we're focused on maximizing revenue and maximizing earnings environment. It is true that what we have seen and everyone has seen that when oil prices go up, you see supply go up and as a result, that puts pressure on airfares, which puts pressure on RASM. I expect that a reversal will happen as well. But when you see if oil prices go up that you will see airfares go up as well. But we are focused on maximizing earnings as opposed to trying to artificially manage to some retention rate."

As we talked about in the last earnings call, we -- you got to look at all the factors going on. So I think we are utilizing synergies and are realizing benefits. But we don't have a new credit card deal some of the others have. We are exposed to what's happened in Dallas huge increases in capacity and, in particular, we're exposed to Brazil. I mean, an amazing statistic in Brazil. The first month after the merger closed, Brazil was 6.1% of the combined airlines revenue. In November, it was 2% of our revenue. Just massive declines in both Brazil and Venezuela. Venezuela was something like 2.5%, and that's 0.5% or something now. So just massive declines. Those things don't have anything to do with integration. But they do affect your relative results. And if you want to try to look at high-level data to figure out our performance on a relative basis, I think you probably have to adjust for those things. But in any of that, having the best margins of any of the network carriers in 2015 2 years into the merger, I think, is a pretty good metric for how we're doing."

Look, 6 months ago, when I made that forecast isn't the right word, but it was just a simple mathematical extrapolation of assuming the demand environment doesn't change look out and see what the capacity environment looks like and supply was going to be growing faster than demand. And so seems like fairly obvious, if unpopular at the time, statement for me. As you pointed out and as we've said, there is for better or worse, a inverse relationship between fuel prices and revenue. So when fuel prices go down, a lot of that gets passed on as benefit to the consumer and the fares go down. The reverse also happens when fuel prices go up. We see revenue go up. And since I made that original prediction in -- 6 months ago, we've seen a pretty big decline in fuel prices. So I don't have any data to suggest the demand has changed at all. But consistent with the view that you shared and that I agree with that there is a correlation between fuel prices and revenue, if anything, I would say that would push that forecast back a quarter or 2 for when we turn to the point where RASM is positive on a year-over-year basis. All that said, that's not really a forecast. That's not looking at data. I don't have any data that's better than yours. Your forecast or anyone on this call is equally as good as mine. It just assumes that the demand environment stays the same. And in that environment, I think just the move in oil would cause that day to push back. Of course, earnings would've gotten the better because some of that benefit would've flown to the bottom line. If I projecting earnings 6 months ago but just the decline in oil would likely to push that back by a quarter or 2."

And you have to come revenue synergies the big ones that we said we would do for better connectivity once we get to single reservation system. And when we first started the merger, we said the total of that was $300 million codeshare in place between the 2 so we thought that was kind of $150 million left to come, most of which we expect to realize this year. And then another roughly $300 million of route swaps put the right airplanes in the right market. We are just now starting to do that. That really won't get fully ramped up probably until halfway through 2017. We'll do more each month as each month goes along but we want steady state for a couple of years on that one. I think the more interesting thing, which is not technically a synergy, is getting back to running the business and innovating that we were held up from doing because we all we're all heads down focused on getting integration done. So some of that is just blocking and tackling and whether it's in operations are revenue management or IT. We had people whose spending depending on their job, 10% to 50% of their time working on the integration or more for some of them instead of doing their day jobs getting back to the basics of management for example, will be helpful. Getting things implemented like the new frequent flyer program which will happen next year, will be great. Getting basic economy, premium economy done those are all things that we would've done already, but have had to wait. So those aren't technically synergies, but I think they're areas that create more upside for American Airlines than our competitors because we simply have a larger backlog of projects to get done because we we're focused on integration for so long."

Our minimum cash balance that Derek talked about that we've established some around -- of $6.5 billion as a minimum is higher than any other than our large peers. So we're comfortable. We believe that's an important metric and one that we will continue to manage. We do end up as we're bringing on new airplanes and modernizing fleet. obviously, that results in some capital outlays. The -- in today's environment, we can finance those under 4%. And we don't think in its in our shareholder's best interest to forgo those rates. So we will -- as long as rates, we'll continue to do that in fact, over time with a increase start to paying cash, but it doesn't seem to make any sense to do anything but borrow at those rates. So that's what we've been doing. So I expect we would continued to do what the result of that as Derek said in his comments is the kind of metrics we think makes sense balance sheet, which are metrics such as like net debt to EBITDAR. We expect will peak in 2016 better to go forward because the amount of capital is going to decline. So at any rate that's where we are. We're very comfortable with it. We believe that's the best way to manage this. We don't think the right thing to do is to use our cash to buy airplanes right now when we can borrow at 4%. And we believe the right thing to do is hold a very high level -- a higher level of cash and than our peers to offset the fact that we're going to have less free collateral in terms of aircraft because we're going to be financing those. But put it all together, we feel really good about it. We think that's the best way to manage the balance sheet for our shareholders. The other thing I'd probably should note chance to say yet is that indeed we are, in fact, bullish about the prospects here it. This is that's we've noted that we purchased $1.1 billion of our shares in the quarter. That's because we continue to believe they're really good value. In the almost 30 years now that I run this business, I can't remember a bigger disconnect between what we're seeing in our airline and in our forward prospects and what the markets and how the markets treating our stock. So that we believe provides some opportunity to repurchase. And that's what a lot of our cash is going. We think it's the right thing. So as long as the market provides that opportunity, we'll continue to do that. We'll make sure that we have that we stay well above our minimum cash levels are doing that, but the airlines a lot of cash. The market cap doesn't seem to be anywhere close to what the airlines generating cash. So we'll use the excess cash to repurchase shares you can that'll be a good thing for investors as we move forward."

It's you're given -- your not retaining shares are down because fuel prices are down and you're paying your employees more. And it feels a lot to me anyway because trees instead of the forest and the reality is we're producing record profits as Scott said margins that are higher than our peers. And not just record profits, this is record for us. I think it's the highest any airlines ever produced. And if you look -- if you actually just look to the cash flow, instead of wishing they were higher, I can't imagine how you think the stock is undervalued. We certainly don't buying it. So I think that's what's being missed. I think people tend to look to expectations if oil is at $30 last year, it was at whatever, how come therefore earnings aren't much higher? There are a lot of reasons we're happy to explain them. But if you went and built a model that's everything happens fuel price is going to result in higher earnings you, of course, are going to be disappointed. There is a real connection between fuel prices and pricing. And indeed, we've got an industry where people where our employees have gone through incredibly difficult times and pay cuts that were going to be when they only get profitable. And that's a good thing. And we're really happy about that. So that's -- so but look, so those things, again maybe I am if anything, maybe we missed if people don't understand those points. But as Scott said also, what I really think this is a business now that is so much dramatically different than anybody seen before they still can't figure it out. And every time you see things like oh oil prices went down and now wages are going up here you guys go again. And nothing can be further from the truth. This is what's happening is industry that's beginning to act like a real industry. And people who have worked hard in the industry getting their compensation back to where it belongs. And that's natural. But that's a real-time run rate kind of issue as opposed to, I think, what people think's going on. So look, it all feels good to us. Were really, really bullish like us had never seen a bigger disconnect. In some sense that's good because we do -- we are excess cash and we use that to buy back our shares at these low rates.

So a lot of things could cause a change including the interest rate environment if indeed we get to a point where it is the comes more expensive to borrow against airplanes. We may decide to start paying cash for aircraft. So any of those things could change it. I don't foresee any of those happening by the way, other than perhaps start getting closer to fair value.

And that's the decision you would make if you want that's what you cared about was driving toward an investment-grade rating. We would not be borrowing at 4%. We have paid down all of the high-cost debt in the company. We are investing into the airline. Everywhere we think makes sense and its billions and billions of dollars, as you know. And we're spending and improving this airline in ways that we think are going to provide really nice returns for our investors going forward. And so and again so that comes first then we go to pay down debt then we look to make sure we have enough cash to go forward. And if we have extra cash that belongs to you guys, then we return it to you. That's what we think the right way to do it. We think that's the best way to do for our shareholders.

But that's the right way to manage the cash generated from the company not to go trying to get to some look, in the other point make on this is I don't know what happened if he got to that point. What I know is right now, we're borrowing at well below investment-grade rates as -- so I'm not sure what benefits we get from that point. So look, we care about the rating, of course. We work well with the rating agencies. We just have a different view, I think, than some of our competitors about what the right way to manage -- what the right leverage amounts are. And it doesn't seem to make any sense. It doesn't make sense to us at this point. And again, it's also worth noting that we are well into a fleet modernization program that the others have not begun and one day will need to begin. But that also comes into play here. So as we bring on this debt, it really becomes an incremental question each time as we bring out these aircraft. How are we going to pay for them?

Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com.

We're pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results for 2015. It's hard to imagine that, just 2 years ago, this -- American Airlines was emerging from bankruptcy, but we were. In the first year, the company produced record profits of $4.2 billion, excluding special items. That was the record that we set in 2014, which was more than double that American ever made in its past. This year, we've exceeded that with the results we've released today of $6.3 billion, so a new record beating last year's record for the quarter; a new record of $1.3 billion, exceeding last. This is all the result of incredibly hard work and great work by 100,000 employees who are just doing a phenomenal job at taking care of customers while we work through an integration, particularly the [indiscernible] integration. It was just a year ago the big concern was whether or not -- was how much disruption this airline might put upon its customers as we work through integration. As other airlines have, in the past, had difficulties, our team hit the ball out of the park, accomplishing things like frequent flyer integration, single operating certificate, reservations system migration; all of those things done flawlessly. And again, great credit to a really phenomenal team who is doing a great job. We still have a lot to do. We're well aware of that, but we are well on our way to restoring American as the greatest airline in the world. Our team is doing a phenomenal job. We're actually really proud of the results they've produced and very pleased with our outlook given the positioning we have today.
So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek, who will give you a lot more details on the financials. And then Scott will follow with some other details primarily revenue related. Derek?"
168569,321715951,923740,"American Airlines Group Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","American Airlines Group Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody.In our earnings release filed this morning, we reported record earnings, as Doug said, for both our fourth quarter and full year 2015. Excluding net special credits, our fourth quarter net profit was $1.3 bil",1743,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody.
In our earnings release filed this morning, we reported record earnings, as Doug said, for both our fourth quarter and full year 2015. Excluding net special credits, our fourth quarter net profit was $1.3 billion or $2 per diluted share. This represents a $182 million improvement versus our fourth quarter 2014 net profit excluding net special charges. Our fourth quarter 2015 pretax margin, excluding net special charges, increased 2.8 points year-over-year to a record 13.4%.
Our 2015 net earnings, excluding net special credits, were up 50% year-over-year to $6.3 billion or $9.12 per diluted share. And this compares to a 2014 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $4.2 billion or $5.70 per diluted share. Our 2015 pretax margin, excluding net special charges, increased by 5.5 points to a record 15.3%.
Total capacity for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 65.5 billion ASMs, up 0.6% from the same period in 2014. And mainline capacity for the quarter was 58.1 billion ASMs, up 0.5%. Regional capacity for the quarter was up 1.4% to 7.31 billion ASMs.
In 2015, we did continue our fleet renewal program by investing more than $5.3 billion in new aircraft, providing the company with the youngest and most modern fleet of the U.S. network airlines. In 2015, the company took delivery of 75 new mainline aircraft while retiring 112 aircraft. And the company also added 52 regional aircraft to its fleet, while we removed 31 regional aircraft from the fleet. This program will continue in 2016 when we take delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft while adding 49 regional aircraft. We expect to remove 92 mainline aircraft and 29 regional aircraft from our fleet in 2016. With these new deliveries, our mainline average age will drop below 10 years, further widening the age gap between American and our network peers.
Recently, we reached an agreement with Airbus to defer 2 of the 6 2017 A350 aircraft deliveries to 2020. These deferrals should help us match the pace of widebody deliveries to our projected needs for international flights. This new schedule still has us taking 4 A350s next year, as we remain the North American launch customer.
Our fourth quarter 2015 revenue was negatively impacted by large capacity increases in certain domestic segments as well as weaker yields in international markets due principally to foreign currency devaluation. Lower surcharges and continued economic softness in Latin America also contributed to the decline in revenue. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $9.6 billion, down 5.2% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $8.3 billion, down 5.4%, driven by 8.9% lower yields on a 0.6% increase in system capacity. Cargo revenues were down 17.3% due primarily to a 15.5% decline in yields. And other operating revenues were relatively flat at $1.1 billion.
Total RASM in the fourth quarter was $0.1471, down 5.8%, driven primarily by a decline in passenger RASM, which was $0.1269. And as Doug said, Scott will give us more detail on our revenue performance.
Consistent with the first 9 months of 2015, our fourth quarter financial results continued to reflect the significant savings from our -- the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes, for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.50 per gallon, a 40.6% decline from $2.52 per gallon in the fourth quarter last year.
Total operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 7.9% versus the same period last year due primarily to the decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Operating expenses, excluding net special charges, in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $8.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Driven by lower fuel costs, fourth quarter mainline cost per ASM, excluding special charges, was $0.1148, down 8.3% year-over-year. If you exclude net special charges and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0922, up 6.3%. This increase was due primarily to contractual rate increases for our new labor agreements. Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding net special charges and fuel, was $0.161 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.5%.
Total consolidated CASM in the fourth quarter was up 5.5% due principally to the contractual labor increases I've mentioned earlier and the increased flying under capacity purchase agreements.
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $8.7 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of cash and investments of $6.3 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also has a restricted cash position of $695 million. These balances reflect the full write-down of $592 million of Venezuela bolivars. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we did generate $674 million in cash flow from operations, which is adjusted for the write-down of Venezuela bolivars; and paid $332 million in scheduled debt payments.
In the fourth quarter, the company returned approximately $1.2 billion to its shareholders through the payment of $72 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.1 billion of common stock or 25.6 million shares. When combined with the dividends and share repurchases during the first 3 quarters of 2015, the company returned approximately $3.9 billion to its shareholders in 2015 and reduced its shares outstanding by 85.1 million shares. In addition, in 2015, the company elected to pay approximately $306 million to cover employee tax withholding obligations on equity awards, further reducing the share count by 7 million.
Despite volatility in the capital markets during January 2016, the company was able to secure attractive financing rates to fund a portion of its aircraft deliveries. Earlier this month, the company issued approximately $1.1 billion in enhanced equipment trust certificates at a blended coupon of just under 4%. The proceeds from this financing were used to fund aircraft deliveries in 2015.
As we indicated on our Third Quarter Call, we would like to provide you with our views on liquidity and leverage. Looking forward, 2016 and '17 will be a peak period for capital expenditures as we spend approximately $4.5 billion on our fleet renewal program. Beginning in 2018, however, our aircraft CapEx will decline from $4.5 billion to approximately $3 billion each year. Our 2016 and '17 non-aircraft CapEx guidance is $1.2 billion each year, and we expect this to decline to an annual rate of approximately $800 million, starting in 2018, as we complete integration of our internal systems.
In today's earnings and interest rate environment, liquidity is the first and most important metric we look at. We ended the year with $8.7 billion in available liquidity, which is more than we believe is required to run the airline. But given our leverage, we believe it is important to retain liquidity at levels higher than our network peers', so we plan to maintain an industry-leading liquidity level of at least $6.5 billion for the foreseeable future. As to leverage, under our current plan, we expect our primary metrics such as net debt-to-EBITDAR to peak in 2016 and then begin declining each year going forward as our CapEx budget declines.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We're forecasting overall system scheduled capacity growth to be up approximately 3%, with full year domestic capacity growth of approximately 2%, while international capacity is expected to be up approximately 6%, primarily growth in the Pacific. By quarter, mainline capacity breaks down as follows: 57.4 billion ASMs in the first quarter, 63.4 billion in the second, 65.1 billion in the third and 58.8 billion in the fourth. Regional capacity each quarter is 7.48 billion in the first, 8.29 billion in the second, 8.69 billion in the third and 8.46 billion in the fourth.
For the full year 2016, we are forecasting year-over-year total CASM, ex special items and fuel, to be up approximately 0.5% to 2.5%. This does not include the effect of labor deals currently being negotiated but does include all contracts that have been ratified. Mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be up approximately 1% to 3%; while regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down 4% to 6%. By quarter, mainline CASM should be up 1% to 3% for each of the 4 quarters. Regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, we believe the first quarter to be approximately flat and the second to fourth quarter down approximately 5% to 7%.
Based on the fuel curve as of January 27, we expect to see another year with significant fuel savings. While other airlines are just beginning to realize these savings, we have directly benefited from lower fuel prices due to our lack of fuel hedges. We are forecasting our 2016 consolidated fuel price to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25 per gallon. The first quarter is expected to be $1.15 to $1.20; the second, $1.16 to $1.21; third, $1.21 to $1.26; and fourth, $1.25 to $1.30. While it's still very early in the year, based on these prices, we expect our 2016 consolidated fuel expense to improve by approximately $2 billion year-over-year.
Using the midpoints of guidance we have provided, along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect our first quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 12% and 14%.
For taxes, as of December 31, 2015, the company had approximately $8 billion of federal net operating losses and $4 billion in state NOLs, substantially all of which are expected to be available in 2016 to reduce future federal and state taxable income. The company expects to recognize a provision for income taxes, beginning in 2016, at an effective rate of approximately 38%, which will be substantially noncash as a result of having reversed the valuation allowance at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.
In terms of CapEx, we've talked about it a little bit, but we expect total gross aircraft CapEx in '16 to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion will be in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect to invest $1.2 billion in non-aircraft CapEx, which includes many investments to improve our products and operation. We also expect to make $2.4 billion in debt payments throughout the year.
In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, 2015 was another tremendous year for American Airlines. We successfully completed several integration milestones; made significant investments in our product, our people and our fleet, all while producing record earnings. We look forward to another great year in 2016.
Thank you for your time. And I'll pass it over to Scott for comments on the revenue side."

And I'd like to start by thanking all the people of American Airlines for a really fantastic job they've been doing in some unusually difficult weather conditions lately. The people of AA continued to make great operational progress in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015, with improvement in almost all of our operating metrics. It seems like a long time ago, but it was just during the fourth quarter that we completed the most successful reservation system cutover in airline history, so thanks again to the team for such a smooth cutover. And now that the rest of the migration is behind us, the team has numerous initiatives underway to further improve our operational performance for our employees and customers.
On the revenue front, our fourth quarter PRASM was down 5.4%. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 3%. And we saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Charlotte. And the second strongest domestic performance was in DFW, and that's in spite of all the capacity that's been added here. The weakest performance was in Miami, although that's really a function of declining connecting revenues coming from South America. Internationally, the strong U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges account for 2.4 points of our total system PRASM decline.
The Atlantic was our best-performing international region, with PRASM down 7%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10%, with weakness in both Japan and China but positive year-over-year PRASM in South Korea and Hong Kong. Latin PRASM was down 17%, but as it's been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela where PRASM was down 40% and 59%, respectively.
Looking forward, the factors driving year-over-year PRASM declines remain very similar to the last few quarters. Scheduled capacity remains elevated in all regions, and Q1 will actually see higher capacity growth than any quarter we saw last year. As we move into the second quarter and the back half of the year, however, we expect capacity growth rates to moderate each quarter. While we're now overlapping some of the moves in the dollar from last year, the dollar does continue to strengthen against many currencies around the world such as the Brazilian real. We project that currency and surcharge declines will impact system PRASM by 1.7 points in Q1, which is down from the 2.4 points in Q4.
As we experienced throughout 2015, we continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas, and we won't see that moderate until the fourth quarter. And the economy, currencies and revenue environment in Brazil and Venezuela continue to deteriorate. We still don't realistically expect any improvement in South America until the Brazilian economy turns around. Given all this, we expect our system PRASM to decline 6% to 8% year-over-year in the first quarter, though as I said, we expect to see smaller declines in 2Q and beyond.
In conclusion. We passed a significant integration milestone in the fourth quarter. The American Airlines team is doing a great job running the airline, and we're busy making further improvements to the operation and products now that we're past that integration hurdle. The revenue environment remains challenged by the same factors that we experienced in 2015, but we expect the first quarter to mark the bottom and the rest of the year to see an inflection in revenue results."

And we've got prior program, all kinds of other programs, so we're focused on maximizing revenue and maximizing earnings in any environment. It is true that what we have seen and everyone has seen, that when oil prices go up, you see supply go up, and as a result, that puts pressure on airfares and which puts pressure on RASM. I expect that the reverse will happen as well, that when you see -- if oil prices go up, that you will see airfares go up as well.

As we talked about in our last earnings call, we -- you got to look at all the other factors that are going on. So I think we are realizing synergies and are realizing benefits, but we don't have a new credit card deal that some of the others have. We are exposed to what's happened in Dallas, plus huge increases in capacity. And in particular, we're exposed to Brazil. We need an amazing statistic in Brazil. The first month after the merger closed, Brazil was 6.1% of the combined airlines' revenue. In November, it was 2% of our revenue, just massive declines in both Brazil and Venezuela. Venezuela was something like 2.5%, and that's 0.5% or something now. So just massive declines. Those things don't have anything to do with integration, but they do affect your relative results. And so I think you -- if you want to try to look at high-level data to figure out how we're performing on a relative basis, I think you'd probably have to adjust for those things. But in any event, having the best margins of any of the network carriers in 2015, 2 years into the merger, I think, is a pretty good metric for how we're doing."

And supply was going to be growing faster than demand. And so it seemed like a fairly obvious, if unpopular, at the time, statement for me. As you pointed out and as we've said, there is a -- for better or worse, a inverse relationship between fuel prices and revenue, so when fuel prices go down, a lot of that gets passed on as benefit to the consumer and fares go down. The reverse also happens. When fuel prices go up, we see revenue go up. Since I made that original prediction in 6 months ago, we've seen a pretty big decline in fuel prices. So I don't have any data to suggest the demand has changed at all, but consistent with the view that you shared and that I agree with that there is a correlation between fuel prices and revenue, if anything, I would say that I would push that forecast back a quarter or 2 for when we return to the point where RASM is positive on a year-over-year basis. All that said, that's not really a forecast. That's not looking at data. I don't have any data that's any better than yours. Your forecast or, anyone on this call, is equally as good as mine. It's it just assumes that the demand environment stays the same. And in that environment, I think just the move in oil would cause that date to push back. Of course, earnings would have gotten better because some of that benefit would have flown to the bottom line, if I had been projecting earnings 6 months ago. But just the decline in oil is likely to push that back by a quarter or 2."

This industry has a track record of truly self-destructive behavior on pricing. And whether we talk about American's value pricing in the '90s or Delta's simpler fares last decade, I think each one of those things were good ideas until they were bad ideas when the operating environment changed. So when I see advantage fares, which is a strategy now that your competitor seems to be adopting too, I kind of worry about history repeating itself. So can you help me understand how advantage fares might be different from some of those other things; and why we shouldn't view them as maybe a pricing cancer that can only be undone through some sort of industry restructuring if, say, fuel prices go up again."

The big ones that we've said we would do were better connectivity once we got to a single reservation system. And when we first started the merger, we said the total of that was $300 million. We have the codeshare in place between the two, so we thought that was kind of $150 million left to come, most of which we expect to realize this year. And then another roughly $300 million of route swaps, so being able to put the right airplane in the right market, we are just now starting to do that. That really won't get fully ramped up probably until halfway through 2017. We'll do more each month as each month goes along, but we won't be to steady state for a couple of years on that one. I think the more interesting thing, which is not technically a synergy, is getting back to running the business and innovating that we were held up from doing because we're all heads-down focused on getting the integration done. So some of that is just blocking and tackling and whether it's in operations or revenue management or IT. You have people who's -- who are spending, depending on their job, 10% to 50% of their time working on the integration, or more for some of them, instead of doing their day jobs. And getting back to the basics of management, for example, will be helpful. Getting things implemented like the new frequent flyer program, which will happen next year, will be great; getting basic economy and premium economy done. Those are all things that we would have done already but have had to wait. So those aren't technically synergies, but I think they're areas that create more upside for American Airlines than our competitors because we simply have a larger backlog of projects to get done because we were focused on integration for so long."

On the -- on your, I guess, broad question kind of how do we look at the balance sheet. Look, we're as bullish as we are, we know we want very much to make sure that we manage the company in a way that we can withstand any sort of large shocks. So we think the best way to do that is to ensure we have a large cash balance on hand. Our minimum cash balance that Derek talked about that we've established some around -- of $6.5 billion as a minimum, is higher than any other than our large peers. So we're comfortable. We believe that's an important metric and one that we will continue to manage. We do end up as we're bringing on new airplanes and modernizing fleet. We obviously -- that results in some capital outlays. The -- in today's environment, we can finance those under 4%. And we don't think it's in our shareholders' best interest to forgo those rates. So we will -- as long as those rates stay there, we'll continue to do that, if in fact over time they increase the rates, you're starting to pay cash but it doesn't seem to make any sense to do anything but borrow at those rates. So that's what we've been doing. So I expect we would continue to do, what the result of that is, as Derek said in his comments, is the kind of metrics that we think makes sense for in terms of looking at the balance sheet, which are metrics such as like net debt to EBITDAR. We expect will peak in 2016. It'll be better to go forward because the amount of capital is going to decline. So at any rate that's where we are. We're very comfortable with it. We believe we're -- that's the best way to manage this. We don't think the right thing to do is to use our cash to buy airplanes right now when we can borrow at 4%. And we believe the right thing to do is hold a very high level -- a higher level of cash than our peers to offset the fact that we're going to have less free collateral in terms of aircraft because we're going to be financing those but put it all together, we feel really good about it. We think that's the best way to manage the balance sheet for our shareholders. The other thing I'd probably should note because we don't have the chance to say it yet, is that indeed that we are, in fact, bullish about the prospects here it. This is -- we noted that we purchased $1.1 billion of our shares in the quarter. That's because we continue to believe they're a really good value. In the almost 30 years now that I run this business, I can't remember a bigger disconnect between what we're seeing in our airline and in our forward prospects and what the markets and how the market's treating our stock. So that we believe provide us an opportunity to repurchase. And that's what a lot of our cash is going to. We think it's the right thing. So as long as the market provides that opportunity, we'll continue to do that. We'll make sure that we have, that we stay well above our minimum cash levels are doing that but the airlines are throwing up a lot of cash. The market cap doesn't seem to be anywhere close to what the airlines are generating cash. So we'll use the excess cash to repurchase shares and that'll be a good thing for our investors as we move forward."

Well, look, I think this call so far is indicative of what we're hearing. It's gee, you're given -- you're not retaining it, the fares are down because fuel prices are down and you're paying your employees more. And it feels a lot, to me anyway, like focusing on the trees instead of the forest. And the reality is we are producing record profits as Scott said a couple of times now that margins that are higher than our peers and not just record profits, this is record for us I think it's the highest any airline has ever produced. And if you look -- if you actually just look to the cash flow, instead of wishing they were higher, I can't imagine how you think the stock is undervalued. We certainly don't that's why we're buying it. So I think that's what's being missed. I think people tend to look to expectations and say, ""Gee if oil is at $30 last year, it was at whatever, how come therefore earnings aren't much higher?"" There are a lot of reasons for that, we're happy to explain them. But if you went and build a model that said everything that happens in fuel price is going to result in higher earnings, you, of course, are going to be disappointed. There is a real connection between fuel prices and pricing. And indeed, we've got an industry where people, where our employees have gone through incredibly difficult times and pay cuts that were going to be restored when they only get profitable. And that's a good thing. And we're really happy about that. So that's -- so but look, so those things, again, I guess maybe if anything, maybe we missed it when I explain that, Helane, to people, if people don't understand those points. But as Scott said also, look, what I really think this is a business now that is so much dramatically different than anybody's ever seen before that they can't, they still can't figure it out. And every time you see things like, oh, oil prices went down and now wages are going up, here you guys go again. And nothing can be further from the truth. This is -- what's happening is, it's an industry that's beginning to act like a real industry, and people who have worked hard in the industry getting their compensation back to where it belongs, and that's natural. But that's a real-time run rate kind of issue as opposed to, I think, what people think is going on. So look, it all feels good to us. We are really, really bullish and like I say, I've never seen a bigger disconnect. In some sense that's good because we do -- we are throwing up excess cash and we'll use that to buy back our shares at these low rates but there are investors who get it. And we think they'll do well."

We have Scott and Derek, and with the help of some of our board members, look at this on a regular basis and decide where we think we should be purchasing based upon those factors I said. So a lot of things could cause a change including the interest rate environment if indeed we get to a point where it is -- it becomes more expensive to borrow against airplanes. We may decide to start paying cash for aircraft. So any of those things could change it. I don't foresee any of those happening by the way, other than perhaps it start getting closer to fair value. But nonetheless, that's -- those are the inputs. Earnings prospects, interest rate, the alternatives in terms of aircraft financing and our view of valuation versus the market."

I think if we -- as a company, you do the right thing and I can't imagine any one thing is the right -- the right thing for us right now would be to forgo 4% of financing on new aircraft. And that's the decision you would make if you want to come -- if that's what you cared about was driving toward an investment-grade rating. We would not be borrowing at 4%. We have paid down all the high-cost debt in the company. We are investing into the airline, everywhere we think makes sense and its billions and billions of dollars, as you know. And we're spending and improving this airline in ways that we think are going to provide really nice returns for our investors going forward, so, and again there were -- so that comes first then we go to pay down debt, then we look to make sure we have enough cash to go forward and if we have extra cash that belongs to you guys, then we return it to you. That's what we think the right way to do it is. We think that's the best thing to do for our shareholders. And I believe the market will, indeed, reward that, whether now or later. That's the right way to manage the cash generated from the company not to go trying to get to some -- look, and the other point maybe I should make on this is I don't know what happen if we got to that point. What I know is right now, we're borrowing at well below investment-grade rates as -- so I'm not sure what benefit we get from getting to that point. So look, we care about the rating, of course. We work well with the rating agencies. We just have a different view, I think, than some of our competitors about what the right way to manage -- what the right leverage amounts are. And it doesn't seem to make any sense. It doesn't make sense to us at this point. And again it's also worth noting that we are well into a fleet modernization program that the others have not begun and one day will need to begin. But that also comes into play here. So as we bring on this debt, it really becomes an incremental question each time as we bring on these aircraft. How are we going to pay for them? And we continue to believe at these levels, we should do that through debt financing not by using our cash."

That's serving up the driver of the revenue of the margin overperformance of us versus them. I do -- to be fair to them, the big driver of our outperformance versus them is the fact that they made a fuel hedge that cost them a couple billion dollars. And if you adjust for that, which is what I would argue if I were them, that indeed their margins are higher than ours and we agree with that. They're 5 years ahead of us.

So we put more in our base wages. Delta actually is -- with their revamp, cut back their profit-sharing significantly, put a lot more on the base wages in response to their -- again what I read anyways. They said their employees told them they prefer it that way. They prefer to have more in the base wages. We believe our employees prefer it that way. So we have more in base wages and they have more in profit-sharing and if -- like I say, it's just a different way of compensation and compensating.

Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com.

We're pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results for 2015. It's hard to imagine that just 2 years ago, this -- American Airlines was emerging from bankruptcy, but we were. In the first year, the company produced record profits of $4.2 billion, excluding special items. That was the record that we set in 2014, which was more than double than American had ever made in its past. This year, we've exceeded that with the results we've released today of $6.3 billion, so a new record beating last year's record for the quarter. A new record of $1.3 billion, exceeding last year's $1.1 billion. This is all the result of incredibly hard work and great work by 100,000 employees who are just doing a phenomenal job at taking care of customers while we work through an integration. Particularly as it relates to the integration, it was just a year ago the big concern was whether or not -- was how much disruption this airline might put upon its customers as we worked through integration, as other airlines have in the past and had difficulties, our team hit the ball out of the park, accomplishing things like frequent flyer integration, single operating certificate, reservations system migration, all of those things done flawlessly. And again, great credit to a really phenomenal team who is doing a great job. We still have a lot to do. We're well aware of that, but we are well on our way to restoring American as the greatest airline in the world. Our team is doing a phenomenal job. We're extremely proud of the results they've produced and very pleased with our outlook, given the positioning we have today.
So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek, who will give you a lot more details on the financials. And then Scott will follow with some other details, primarily revenue related. Derek?"

In 2015, the company took delivery of 75 new mainline aircraft while retiring 112 aircraft. And the company also added 52 regional aircraft to its fleet, while we removed 31 regional aircraft from the fleet. This program will continue in 2016, when we take delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft while adding 49 regional aircraft. We expect to remove 92 mainline aircraft and 29 regional aircraft from our fleet in 2016. With these new deliveries, our mainline average age will drop below 10 years, further widening the age gap between American and our network peers.
Recently, we reached an agreement with Airbus to defer 2 of the 6 2017 A350 aircraft deliveries to 2020. These deferrals should help us match the pace of widebody deliveries to our projected needs for international flights. This new schedule still has us taking 4 A350s next year, as we remain the North American launch customer.
Our fourth quarter 2015 revenue was negatively impacted by large capacity increases in certain domestic segments as well as weaker yields in international markets due principally to foreign currency devaluation. Lower surcharges and continued economic softness in Latin America also contributed to the decline in revenue. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $9.6 billion, down 5.2% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $8.3 billion, down 5.4%, driven by 8.9% lower yields on a 0.6% increase in system capacity. Cargo revenues were down 17.3% due primarily to a 15.5% decline in yields. And other operating revenues were relatively flat at $1.1 billion.
Total RASM in the fourth quarter was $0.1471, down 5.8%, driven primarily by a decline in passenger RASM, which was $0.1269. And as Doug said, Scott will give us more detail on our revenue performance.
Consistent with the first 9 months of 2015, our fourth quarter financial results continued to reflect the significant savings from our -- the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes, for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.50 per gallon, a 40.6% decline from $2.52 per gallon in the fourth quarter last year.
Total operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 7.9% versus the same period last year, due primarily to the decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Operating expenses, excluding net special charges, in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $8.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Driven by lower fuel costs, fourth quarter mainline cost per ASM, excluding special charges, was $0.1148, down 8.3% year-over-year. If you exclude net special charges and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0922, up 6.3%. This increase was due primarily to contractual rate increases for our new labor agreements. Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding net special charges and fuel, was $0.161 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.5%.
Total consolidated CASM in the fourth quarter was up 5.5%, due principally to the contractual labor increases I mentioned earlier and the increased flying under capacity purchase agreements.
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $8.7 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of cash and investments of $6.3 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also has a restricted cash position of $695 million. These balances reflect the full write-down of $592 million of Venezuela bolivars. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we did generate $674 million in cash flow from operations, which is adjusted for the write-down of Venezuela bolivars, and paid $332 million in scheduled debt payments.
In the fourth quarter, the company returned approximately $1.2 billion to its shareholders through the payment of $72 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.1 billion of common stock or 25.6 million shares. When combined with the dividends and share repurchases during the first 3 quarters of 2015, the company returned approximately $3.9 billion to its shareholders in 2015 and reduced its shares outstanding by 85.1 million shares. In addition, in 2015, the company elected to pay approximately $306 million to cover employee tax withholding obligations on equity awards, further reducing the share count by 7 million.
Despite volatility in the capital markets during January 2016, the company was able to secure attractive financing rates to fund a portion of its aircraft deliveries. Earlier this month, the company issued approximately $1.1 billion in enhanced equipment trust certificates at a blended coupon of just under 4%. The proceeds from this financing were used to fund aircraft deliveries in 2015.
As we indicated on our third quarter call, we would like to provide you with our views on liquidity and leverage. Looking forward, 2016 and '17 will be a peak period for capital expenditures as we spend approximately $4.5 billion on our fleet renewal program. Beginning in 2018, however, our aircraft CapEx will decline from $4.5 billion to approximately $3 billion each year. Our 2016 and '17 non-aircraft CapEx guidance is $1.2 billion each year, and we expect this to decline to an annual rate of approximately $800 million starting in 2018, as we complete integration of our internal systems.
In today's earnings and interest rate environment, liquidity is the first and most important metric we look at. We ended the year with $8.7 billion in available liquidity, which is more than we believe is required to run the airline. But given our leverage, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers, so we plan to maintain an industry-leading liquidity level of at least $6.5 billion for the foreseeable future. As to leverage, under our current plan, we expect our primary metrics such as net debt-to-EBITDAR to peak in 2016 and then begin declining each year going forward as our CapEx budget declines.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We're forecasting overall system scheduled capacity growth to be up approximately 3%, with full year domestic capacity growth of approximately 2%, while international capacity is expected to be up approximately 6%, primarily growth in the Pacific. By quarter, mainline capacity breaks down as follows: 57.4 billion ASMs in the first quarter, 63.4 billion in the second, 65.1 billion in the third and 58.8 billion in the fourth. Regional capacity each quarter is 7.48 billion in the first, 8.29 billion in the second, 8.69 billion in the third and 8.46 billion in the fourth.
For the full year 2016, we are forecasting year-over-year total CASM, ex special items and fuel, to be up approximately 0.5% to 2.5%. This does not include the effect of labor deals currently being negotiated but does include all contracts that have been ratified. Mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be up approximately 1% to 3%; while regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down 4% to 6%. By quarter, mainline CASM should be up 1% to 3% for each of the 4 quarters. Regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, we believe the first quarter to be approximately flat and the second to fourth quarter down approximately 5% to 7%.
Based on the fuel curve as of January 27, we expect to see another year with significant fuel savings. While other airlines are just beginning to realize these savings, we have directly benefited from lower fuel prices due to our lack of fuel hedges. We are forecasting our 2016 consolidated fuel price to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25 per gallon. The first quarter is expected to be $1.15 to $1.20; the second, $1.16 to $1.21; third, $1.21 to $1.26; and fourth, $1.25 to $1.30. While it's still very early in the year, based on these prices, we expect our 2016 consolidated fuel expense to improve by approximately $2 billion year-over-year.
Using the midpoints of guidance we have provided, along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect our first quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 12% and 14%.
For taxes, as of December 31, 2015, the company had approximately $8 billion of federal net operating losses and $4 billion in state NOLs, substantially all of which are expected to be available in 2016 to reduce future federal and state taxable income. The company expects to recognize a provision for income taxes, beginning in 2016, at an effective rate of approximately 38%, which will be substantially noncash as a result of having reversed the valuation allowance at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.
In terms of CapEx, we've talked about it a little bit, but we expect total gross aircraft CapEx in '16 to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion will be in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect to invest $1.2 billion in non-aircraft CapEx, which includes many investments to improve our product in operation. We also expect to make $2.4 billion in debt payments throughout the year.
In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, 2015 was another tremendous year for American Airlines. We successfully completed several integration milestones; made significant investments in our product, our people and our fleet, all while producing record earnings. We look forward to another great year in 2016.
Thank you for your time. And I'll pass it over to Scott for comments on the revenue side."

And I'd like to start by thanking all the people of American Airlines for the really fantastic job they've been doing in some unusually difficult weather conditions lately. The people of AA continued to make great operational progress in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015, with improvement in almost all of our operating metrics. It seems like a long time ago, but it was just during the fourth quarter that we completed the most successful reservation system cutover in airline history, so thanks again to the team for such a smooth cutover. And now that the res system migration is behind us, the team has numerous initiatives underway to further improve our operational performance for our employees and customers.
On the revenue front, our fourth quarter PRASM was down 5.4%. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 3%. And we saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Charlotte. And the second strongest domestic performance was in DFW, and that's in spite of all the capacity that's been added here. The weakest performance was in Miami, although that's really a function of declining connecting revenues coming from South America. Internationally, the strong U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges account for 2.4 points of our total system PRASM decline.
The Atlantic was our best-performing international region, with PRASM down 7%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10%, with weakness in both Japan and China, but positive year-over-year PRASM in South Korea and Hong Kong. Latin PRASM was down 17%, but as it's been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela, where PRASM was down 40% and 59%, respectively.
Looking forward, the factors driving year-over-year PRASM declines remain very similar to the last 2 quarters. Scheduled capacity remains elevated in all regions, and Q1 will actually see higher capacity growth than any quarter we saw last year. As we move into the second quarter and the back half of the year, however, we expect capacity growth rates to moderate each quarter. While we're now overlapping some of the moves in the dollar from last year, the dollar does continue to strengthen against many currencies around the world such as the Brazilian real. We project that currency and surcharge declines will impact system PRASM by 1.7 points in Q1, which is down from the 2.4 points in Q4.
As we experienced throughout 2015, we continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas, and we won't see that moderate until the fourth quarter. And the economy, currencies and revenue environment in Brazil and Venezuela continue to deteriorate. We still don't realistically expect any improvement in South America until the Brazilian economy turns around. Given all this, we expect our system PRASM to decline 6% to 8% year-over-year in the first quarter, though as I said, we expect to see smaller declines in 2Q and beyond.
In conclusion, we passed a significant integration milestone in the fourth quarter. The American Airlines team is doing a great job running the airline, and we're busy making further improvements to the operation and product now that we're past that integration hurdle. The revenue environment remains challenged by the same factors that we experienced in 2015, but we expect the first quarter to mark the bottom and the rest of the year to see an inflection in revenue results."

And we feel good about the trajectory that we're on in terms of getting the integration done. Now that we're past the integration, it does give us the opportunity to start realizing more synergies, but also moving the ball forward in terms of our operation and in terms of revenue enhancements, doing things like basic and premium economy and a new frequent flyer program, all kinds of other programs. So we're focused on maximizing revenue and maximizing earnings in any environment. It is true that what we have seen, and everyone has seen, that when oil prices go up, you see supply go up, and as a result, that puts pressure on airfares, which puts pressure on RASM. I expect that the reverse will happen as well, that when you see -- if oil prices go up, that you will see airfares go up as well. But we are focused on maximizing earnings as opposed to trying to artificially manage to some retention rate."

As we talked about in our last earnings call, we -- you got to look at all the other factors that are going on. So I think we are realizing synergies and are realizing benefits, but we don't have a new credit card deal that some of the others have. We are exposed to what's happened in Dallas, with huge increases in capacity. And in particular, we're exposed to Brazil. I mean, an amazing statistic in Brazil: the first month after the merger closed, Brazil was 6.1% of the combined airlines' revenue. In November, it was 2% of our revenue, just massive declines in both Brazil and Venezuela. Venezuela was something like 2.5%, and it's 0.5% or something now. So just massive declines. Those things don't have anything to do with integration, but they do affect your relative results. And so I think you -- if you want to try to look at high-level data to figure out how we're performing on a relative basis, I think you'd probably have to adjust for those things. But in any event, having the best margins of any of the network carriers in 2015, 2 years into the merger, I think, is a pretty good metric for how we're doing."

Look, 6 months ago, when I made that -- forecast isn't the right word, but it was just a simple mathematical extrapolation of assuming the demand environment doesn't change, and I had to look out and see what the capacity environment looks like. And supply was going to be growing faster than demand. And so it seemed like a fairly obvious, if unpopular at the time, statement to me. As you pointed out and as we've said, there is a -- for better or worse, a inverse relationship between fuel prices and revenue, so when fuel prices go down, a lot of that gets passed on as benefit to the consumer and fares go down. The reverse also happens. When fuel prices go up, we see revenue go up. Since I made that original prediction in -- 6 months ago, we've seen a pretty big decline in fuel prices. So I don't have any data to suggest that demand has changed at all, but consistent with the view that you shared and that I agree with, that there is a correlation between fuel prices and revenue, if anything, I would say that I would push that forecast back a quarter or 2 for when we turn to the point where RASM is positive on a year-over-year basis. All that said, that's not really a forecast. That's not looking at data. I don't have any data that's any better than yours. Your forecast, or anyone on this call, is equally as good as mine. It's, it just assumes that the demand environment stays the same. And in that environment, I think just the move in oil would cause that date to push back. Of course, earnings would have gotten better because some of that benefit would have flown to the bottom line, if I had been projecting earnings 6 months ago.

And then this industry is -- also another one for you, Scott, too, or Doug -- this industry has a track record of truly self-destructive behavior on pricing. And whether we talk about American's value pricing in the '90s or Delta's simpler fares last decade, I think each one of those things were good ideas until they were bad ideas when the operating environment changed. So when I see Advantage Fares, which is a strategy now that your competitors seem to be adopting, too, I kind of worry about history repeating itself. So can you help me understand how Advantage Fares might be different from some of those other things; and why we shouldn't view them as maybe a pricing cancer that can only be undone through some sort of industry restructuring if, say, fuel prices go up again."

The big ones that we've said we would do were better connectivity once we got to a single reservation system. And when we first started the merger, we said the total of that was $300 million. We had a codeshare in place between the two, so we thought that was kind of $150 million left to come, most of which we expect to realize this year. And then another roughly $300 million of route swaps, so being able to put the right airplane in the right market, we are just now starting to do that. That really won't get fully ramped up probably until halfway through 2017. We'll do more each month as each month goes along, but we won't be to steady state for a couple of years on that one. I think the more interesting thing, which is not technically a synergy, is getting back to running the business and innovating that we were held up from doing because we were all heads down focused on getting the integration done. So some of that is just blocking and tackling. And whether it's in operations or revenue management or IT, you have people who's -- who are spending, depending on their job, 10% to 50% of their time working on the integration, or more for some of them, instead of doing their day jobs. And getting back to the basics of yield management, for example, will be helpful. Getting things implemented, like the new frequent flyer program, which will happen next year, will be great; getting basic economy and premium economy done. Those are all things that we would have done already but have had to wait. So those aren't technically synergies, but I think they're areas that create more upside for American Airlines than our competitors because we simply have a larger backlog of projects to get done because we were focused on integration for so long."

And we don't think it's in our shareholders' best interest to forgo those rates. So we will -- as long as those rates stay there, we'll continue to do that. And if in fact over time they increase, you may see us starting to pay cash, but it doesn't seem to make any sense to do anything but borrow at those rates. So that's what we've been doing, and I expect we would continue to do. What the result of that is, as Derek said in his comments, is the kind of metrics that we think makes sense for in terms of looking at the balance sheet, which are metrics such as like net debt to EBITDAR, we expect will peak in 2016, and it's only going to get better as we go forward, because the amount of capital is going to decline. So at any rate, that's where we are. We're very comfortable with it. We believe we're -- that's the best way to manage this. We don't think the right thing to do is to use our cash to buy airplanes right now when we can borrow at 4%. And we believe the right thing to do is hold a very high level of -- a higher level of cash than our peers to offset the fact that we're going to have less free collateral in terms of aircraft because we're going to be financing those. But put it all together, we feel really good about it. We think that's the best way to manage the balance sheet for our shareholders. The other thing I probably should note, because we haven't had a chance to say it yet, is that indeed, that we are in fact bullish about the prospects here. This is -- we noted that we purchased $1.1 billion of our shares in the quarter. That's because we continue to believe they're a really good value. In the almost 30 years now that I've been in this business, I can't remember a bigger disconnect between what we're seeing in our airline and in our forward prospects and what the markets and how the market's treating our stock. So that we believe provides us an opportunity to repurchase. And that's what a lot of our cash is going to. We think it's the right thing. So as long as the market provides that opportunity, we'll continue to do that. We'll make sure that we have, that we stay well above our minimum cash levels as we're doing that, but the airline's throwing off a lot of cash. The market cap doesn't seem to be anywhere close to what the airline is generating in cash. So we'll use the excess cash to repurchase shares and that'll be a good thing for our investors as we move forward."

Well, look, I think this call so far is indicative of what we're hearing. It's gee, you're given -- you're not retaining it, the fares are down because fuel prices are down and you're paying your employees more. And it feels a lot, to me anyway, like focusing on the trees instead of the forest. And the reality is we are producing record profits, as Scott said a couple of times now, that margins are higher than our peers. And not just record profits, this is record for us, I think it's the highest any airline has ever produced. And if you look -- if you actually just looked through the cash flow, instead of wishing they were higher, I can't imagine how you think the stock is undervalued. We certainly don't, that's why we're buying it. So I think that's what's being missed. I think people tend to look to expectations and say, ""Gee, if oil is at $30, last year, it was at whatever, how come therefore earnings aren't much higher?"" There are a lot of reasons for that, we're happy to explain them. But if you went and built a model that said everything that happens in fuel price is going to result in higher earnings, you, of course, are going to be disappointed. There is a real connection between fuel prices and pricing. And indeed, we've got an industry where people, where our employees, have gone through incredibly difficult times and pay cuts, that were going to be restored when the airline got profitable. And that's a good thing. And we're really happy about that. So that's -- so but look, so those things, again, I guess maybe if anything, maybe we missed it by not explaining that well to people, if people don't understand those points. But as Scott said also, look, what I really think this is a business now that is so much dramatically different than anybody's ever seen before that they can't, they still can't figure it out. And every time you see things like, oh, oil prices went down and now wages are going up, here you guys go again. And nothing can be further from the truth. This is -- what's happening is, it's an industry that's beginning to act like a real industry, and people who have worked hard in the industry getting their compensation back to where it belongs, and that's natural. But that's a real-time run rate kind of issue, as opposed to, I think what people think is going on. So look, it all feels good to us. We are really, really bullish and like I say, I've never seen a bigger disconnect. In some sense that's good, because we do -- we are throwing off excess cash and we'll use that to buy back our shares at these low rates, but there are investors who get it. And we think they'll do well."

So a lot of things could cause it to change, including the interest rate environment.

And that's the decision you would make if you wanted to come -- if that's all you cared about, was driving toward an investment-grade rating. We would not be borrowing at 4%. We have paid down all the high-cost debt in the company. We are investing into the airline, everywhere we think makes sense, and its billions and billions of dollars, as you know. And we're spending and improving this airline in ways that we think are going to provide really nice returns for our investors going forward. So, and again, there were -- so that comes first. Then we go to pay down debt, then we look to make sure we have enough cash to go forward and if we have extra cash, that belongs to you guys, and we return it to you. That's what we think the right way to do it is. We think that's the best thing to do for our shareholders. And I believe the market will indeed reward that, whether now or later. That's the right way to manage the cash generated from the company, not to go trying to get to some -- look, and the other point I really should make on this is I don't know what would happen if we got to that point. What I know is right now, we're borrowing at well below investment-grade rates as -- so I'm not sure what benefit we get from getting to that point. So look, we care about the rating, of course. We work well with the rating agencies. We just have a different view, I think, than some of our competitors about what the right way to manage -- what the right leverage amounts are. And it doesn't seem to make any sense, it doesn't make sense to us at this point. And again, it's also worth noting that we are well into a fleet modernization program that the others have not begun and one day will need to begin. But that also comes into play here. So as we bring on this debt, it really becomes an incremental question each time as we bring on these aircraft. How do we want to pay for them? And we continue to believe at these levels, we should do that through debt financing, not by using our cash."

Of the margin overperformance of us versus them, I do think, to be fair to them, the big driver of our outperformance versus them is the fact that they made a fuel hedge that cost them a couple billion dollars.

So we put more in our base wages. Delta, actually, is -- with their revamp, cut back their profit-sharing significantly, put a lot more into base wages in response to their -- again, what I read anyways, is they said their employees told them they prefer it that way. They prefer to have more in the base wages. We believe our employees prefer it that way. So we have more in base wages and they have more in profit-sharing, and if -- like I say, it's just a different way of compensation and compensating.

As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected.
Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com.
A webcast of this will also be archived on our website and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

Thanks, everyone, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items at $1.2 billion and it's slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 201",663,"Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everyone, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items at $1.2 billion and it's slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 2015. But a more relevant to our shareholders on an adjusted earnings per share basis, EPS actually grew 15% versus last year's record. That, of course, because our share count is lower due to the share repurchase program we've had in place.
And absolute earnings would have been slightly higher than last year's record slightly lower except for the company's unilateral decision to institute a profit sharing program for our employees beginning in 2016. And our investors may question that decision, it's a big decision and the fact of the matter is we at American had attempted to transform our industry's compensation structure consistent with our view that our industry been transformed. 
In short, we believe the best way as most industries do to pay our hard-working team is to give them an industry-leading base wages, that have lower wages and give them the share of the profits at the end of the year. But as it became more clear over time that our competitors were not going to do the same. It became a real issue for our team and therefore for our shareholders. And while the team understood the logic, we've couldn't get past a collective view amongst the team that the company didn't appreciate their contributions to the success of the team and that certainly wasn't the intent nor our view. So we implemented a unilateral 5% profit sharing program. The first accrual of which is in these results. The accrual was $73 million were achieved. We're quite pleased with that and we believe the shareholders as well. The fact of the matter is the announcement had the impact that we had hoped. Our team is excited. They're engaged. They are intent upon returning American to be the greatest airline in the world and we're seeing it in the results. You can see it in the great job our team is running around airline, taking care of our customers. So I will begin by thanking them for their continued hard work and everything they're doing to return American to greatness and take care of our customers. 
As for the share repurchase, we returned more than $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter and our board has authorized a new $2 billion repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. Look, we're purchasing our shares because we're bullish on the stock and our prospects at American. We think it's a great investment for a couple of the reasons. 1, we continue to believe that the market does not seem to fully appreciate the transformation that's taken place in this industry. And as a result, we believe the industry is well undervalued. Second, we think American Airlines has more upside than anyone else in the industry. We're not done with the integration. We have -- we are making investments at a rate that no other airlines has done in the past in the product and our people, which will turn into our product. And that gives us upside that others don't have. So we're very bullish. But look because we're bullish, it doesn't mean we are totally pleased with the current performance because we're not. In particular, discipline in our revenue performance on both an absolute level and relative to some of our peers. And Scott will take some time to explain the current situation and the outlook. But just know that we don't view the current revenue trends as either acceptable or long-term. If we did, we wouldn't be as bullish as we are. So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek to give you a lot more details and then Scott will give you some color and I will take questions. Derek?"
168569,330447003,961805,"American Airlines Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","American Airlines Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. In our 10-Q and earnings press release filed this morning, we reported first quarter 2016 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share. This compares to 2015 net profit, e",1777,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. In our 10-Q and earnings press release filed this morning, we reported first quarter 2016 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share. This compares to 2015 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $1.2 billion or $0.0173 per diluted share. 
As we talked about our last call, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company concluded that realization of substantially all of the deferred tax assets principally net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs was more likely than that. This was the basis for the company's strong financial performance since the merger and expectations of financial sustain future profitability. Accordingly, the company reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2015. Starting with its first quarter of 2016 results, the company will be recognizing a provision for income tax that has substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. 
For 2016, quarterly net profit will not be comparable to net profit of 2015. As a result, we believe pretax profit, excluding net special items, is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance and net income. 
On a net basis, our first quarter pretax profit, excluding net special charges, was $1.22 billion, which resulted in record first quarter pretax margin of 12.9%. This compares to our 2015 first quarter pretax profit, excluding net special charges, of $1.25 billion and a pretax margin of 12.7%. 
As Doug talked about, excluding the effects of our special items and the noncash tax provision, our first quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was up 15% to $1.99 per share, reflecting a 15% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the first quarter of 2016 was 65.1 billion ASMs, up 3.6% from the same period in 2015 with mainline capacity up 3.1% and regional capacity was up 8.1%. We continue to make significant investments in our fleet renewal program, which has given the company the youngest and most modern fleet of the U.S. network airlines. By the end of this year, we expect the average age of our mainline fleet to fall below 10 years, well below any of our network competitors. In the first quarter of 2016, the company took delivery of 15 new mainline aircraft, while retiring 19 mainline aircraft. The company also added 13 regional aircraft and removed 3 regional aircraft. This program will continue throughout the year when we expect to take delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft, while adding 49 regional aircraft. And if we could keep our capacity in check, we expect to remove 86 mainline aircraft and 23 regional aircraft from our fleet during the year.
Our first quarter 2016 revenue continue to be negatively impacted by competitive capacity increases principally in certain domestic markets, economic softness in Latin America and the impact of a stronger dollar in foreign markets. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $9.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $8.1 billion, down 4.2%, driven by 7.1% lower yields on a 3.6% increase in system capacity. 
Cargo revenues were down 16.8% to $162 million due primarily to a 15.3% decline in yields in international freight. Other operating revenues were relatively flat at $1.2 billion. 
Total RASM in the first quarter of 2016 was $0.145, down 7.3% driven principally by a decline in passenger RASM of 7.5%, which Scott will talk about in a minute. 
As Doug mentioned in his remarks, on March 23, we introduced an employee profit sharing program, which will pay out 5% of pretax profit, excluding special items starting with our full year 2016 results. This program was retroactive to January 1 and accordingly, we recognize $73 million of profit sharing expense in the first quarter. The company also accelerated a contractual marked-to-market the rate adjustment for the company's flight attendants and reach agreement with our dispatchers on a new contract in April. Costs associated with these rate adjustments and the profit sharing program will be included in our forward CASM guidance that I'll discussed later.
Our first quarter financial results continue to reflect the significant savings from the year-over-year decline in jet fuel prices. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the first quarter of 2016 was down 34.1% to $1.20 per gallon. Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.1 billion, down 5.9% versus the same period last year due primarily to $607 million decrease in consolidated; fuel expense. Operating expenses, excluding net special charges, for the first quarter of 2016 were $8 billion, down 3.7% year-over-year. 
First quarter mainline CASM, cost per ASM, excluding net special charges, was $0.1141, down 6.9% year-over-year due primarily to lower fuel costs. Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0962 in the first quarter, up 1.4% year-over-year. This increase was due primarily to contractual labor rate increases including for our customer service and the introduction of our profit sharing plan. This rate increases were offset in part by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses.
Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding special items and fuel, was $0.1611 for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 2.2% and our consolidated first quarter CASM was up 1%. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.9 billion and a $2.4 billion undrawn revolver capacity. 
The company also had $691 million classified in restricted cash. During the first quarter of 2016, we generated $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations and paid $310 million scheduled debt payments. As a reminder, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we provided our view on leverage and liquidity for American going forward. In particular, we stated that in today's earnings and interest rate environment, liquidity was the most important metric we consider. And given our relative leverage, we expect to maintain our liquidity of at least $6.5 billion. We also provided guidance with respect to where we are with our fleet rental program, access to attractive debt in the capital markets, ongoing share repurchase programs and belief that the American will produce sustained earnings. Our liquidity of $9.4 billion for the quarter and was up -- up from $8.7 billion at the end of 2015 and was well in excess of the $6.5 billion liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. 
As previously mentioned, we believe it's important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our own overall leverage and that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
With respect to leverage, we look to metrics, such as net debt-to-EBITDAR and with our planned aircraft financing this year, we continue to expect that on this matter, we will peak in 2016 and then begin to see this decline each year going forward as our capital spending declines. 
In early January, the company issued $1.1 billion and enhanced equipment trust certificates at a blended rate just below 4%. The proceeds for this financing were used to finance aircraft previously delivered in 2015. The company also raised approximately $4 billion, [ph] $400 million in other low-cost aircraft financing during the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company returned more than $1.6 billion to its shareholders through the repayment of $61 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.56 billion of common stock or 39.3 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid 2014, the company has returned approximately $6.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $6.1 billion and dividends of $0.5 billion. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity words and shares distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped to 23% from 756.1 million at merger close to 585.7 million shares on March 31, 2016. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $850 million remaining on its current authorization and as a result, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. On a program-to-date basis, the company's Board of Directors has authorized a total of $9 billion of share repurchases.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, we continued to value our capacity and [indiscernible] update 2 weeks ago, we Lauridsen capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2.5%. Full year domestic capacity growth is expected to be up approximately 2.5% and international has been reduced from 6% down to 2.5%. By quarter, the first quarter is $62.2 billion -- or second quarter $62.6 billion -- excuse me, $64.8 billion in the third, $58.9 million in the fourth. On a regional breakdown, it's $8.01 billion in the second, $8.22 billion in the third and $8.08 billion in the fourth.
On a cost side, we're forecasting year-to-year mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, to be up approximately 3% to 5% with the regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. Mainline CASM in the first and second quarter will be up between 4% ang 6% and in the fourth quarter, up 3% to 5%. Regional CASM be down by approximately 4% to 6% in the second quarter and down 3% to 5% in both the third and fourth quarter.
Based on the overall fuel curve of April 18, 2016, we you expect to see another year of significant year-over-year fuel savings. In our second quarter, we expect $1.30 to $1.35; third quarter, $1.36 to $1.41; fourth quarter, $1.40 to $1.45. 
On the regional side, the second quarter we have $1.35 to $1.40; third quarter $1.43 to $1.48; and fourth quarter, $1.47 to $1.52. And based on these prices, we expect our 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease the approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year.
Using the midpoints of guidance we provided along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect our second quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 16%. The capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion will occur in the second quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect to invest $1.2 billion for nonaircraft CapEx, which includes investment to improve our product and the operations.
So in conclusion, thanks for the efforts of more than 100,000 team members, we have strong first quarter results, which make an excellent start to 2016. While still have about before to do to complete our integration and our continued financial success, as well positioned for the years ahead. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Scott."

And I'd like to start by thanking our operations team and 100,000 people of American Airlines continue to make great strides. And in fact, the first quarter was our best operational quarters since the merger closed. Despite the fact that we're years behind our competitors and starting the merger integration process, we've already gotten to a point where we're neck and neck for first place in departures and [indiscernible], which we view as a primary metric for core operating reliability. And our other operating metrics were showing improvement as well with mishandled baggage rates down over 20% year-over-year and significant improvement in completion factor. 
But we know we can do even better. We have many initiatives and technology projects underway to further improve all of our operating metrics and are well on the path to operating the best airline in the world. Of the revenue front, the first quarter confused challenging revenue environment with PRASM down 7.5%. Domestically, our consolidated PRASM was down 5.3%. We saw the strongest performance year-over-year in Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago. That the weakest performance once again was in Miami although that's still really a function of declining connecting revenues from South America. Internationally, the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges made up 1.7 points of total system PRASM decline. So that is a smaller impact than we saw in fourth quarter as we're beginning to overlap the dollar appreciation from last year. 
The Atlantic was our best-performing international region with PRASM down 2.1%. While we're relatively pleased with that result, we expect capacity growth across the Atlantic this summer to drive some incremental pressure in this region. 
Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 16% on 29% ASM growth. With continued weakness in both Japan and China, but positive year-over-year PRASM in South Korea. 
Latin PRASM was down 17% but as it's been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela, where PRASM was down 39% and 48%, respectively. 
Looking forward, while the comes gets easier in 2Q, the revenue environment remains challenging. We expect the revenue environment to remain challenging throughout 2016 but longer term, we feel quite positive about all the initiatives we have in place to drive higher revenues, including basic and premium, a new revenue base frequent flyer program, $3 billion in new product investments, our continued fleet modernization program and the best people in the industry who are focused on delivering the best customer service. 
We also recognize that the market is rightly concerned about getting back to positive PRASM and we're also focused on that as explicit internal goal. I think that time line is unfortunately, we've pushed in the next year and some of the long-term initiatives I described will make a big difference in that regard in 2017. But we'd also like to finalize to accelerate the PRASM positive trends in this year. Doing so will require a fair level of sequential improvement. But one of the areas were focused on in the near term, it include implementing a new demand forecasting system and yield management. This initiative were will know will ultimately produce much better results but as we've implemented this, in the recent past, we've had 1 some step forward, 2 steps back issues with the new system. 
We're cautiously optimistic that we're through some of the tipping pain, and in fact, as we look out into the summer, our PRASM for June and beyond looks much better than April and May. As most of you know, we're also in the middle of negotiations for new credit card deal. 
While I won't predict on this call when or even if we'll ever get a deal done, all of our large players have done new deals in the past couple of years and we expect a similar larger tailwind for American Airlines when we do ultimately get a new deal done. 
Further, we also adjust capacity in a world where we see declining demand. American Airlines was the slowest growing airline in the United States last year. And as you've seen for several quarters in a row, we can continue to reduce our capacity plan in light of declining year-over-year PRASM. 
So while we believe the long-term outlook is bright and even have near-term opportunities that could drive outperformance. I know that many people on this call are a little more focused just on 2Q revenues. So for the second quarter, total scheduled capacity remains elevated in all regions and hilw capacity growth rates were down slightly from the first quarter levels, total capacity still growing faster than the economies in all regions of the world. 
As we move into the back half of the year, however, we still expect capacity growth rates to moderate further from the first of level. As we experienced throughout 2015, we continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas, and we don't expect that to moderate until September. And while the comps gets busier, the economy, currencies and revenue environment in Brazil and Venezuela mobile continued to deteriorate on a sequential basis. Hearing all this, we expect our system PRASM to decline 6% to 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. In conclusion, the near-term revenue environment remains challenging. While we're delivering solid bottom line results, we are getting back to PRASM growth is important to our near and long-term future. So to do that, we are making smart investments in our product and continuing to modernize our fleet dividends focus on improving our operations in starting to see the results and our operating metrics and we're investing in our people, our team members are responsible for delivering great service our customers each and everyday. In the near term, we are focused on better day-to-day execution in revenue management and that in our new yield management system properly time. When you put it altogether, we for the good about the foundation will billion dollars for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operations and drive higher revenues."

What had happened is we've lost a part of the team not because they understood analytically the argument we laid out, that we've laid out for you, and that we lay out all the time. And certainly past our looking in the eye test, which is important to us. We will our employees in the area and all the way met the decisions, and we could do that extremely well. We are still since we were getting back on this 1. I mean The employees got it with their brains but they didn't get it in their hearts. And it really felt like -- again, largely because, while our other -- while our competitors kind were moving in our direction, they weren't going to the point that we're in and other airlines have in place this profit-sharing programs, and we did not. And to our team like we -- well, they understood again the logic. Help us we weren't appreciating their contribution to the bottom line, which is the last thing we were trying to accomplish. So what we realized is if we were going to really get our team engaged and excited which is an imperative to accomplishing [indiscernible] accomplishing all of the things Scott talked about that we're working on to get or to compete against the other airlines, particularly for premium travelers. We had Derek, our engaged and excited and this was holding us back. So I firmly belief it's in our shareholders' best interest to do it, and wouldn't have been otherwise. We have indeed seen an uplift in engagement and excitement because of this. Not so much I don't think because of the actual dollars involved just because it proved what our employees want to believe that indeed it is different. And that we will listen and that we will do things even though we've made -- even though we take strong positions if it gets to the point that we think it's not working, we're willing to revisit those decisions. So all those things have had a positive impact on, I think, that's good for -- I know it's good for our shareholders. It's impossible to quantify and it's also early. The real challenge to the team is to not build on it. This is temporary. While the profit-sharing will stay in place, the feeling of instituting profit-sharing is not going to stay in place. It will become just I imagine over time just part of everyone's conversation that -- and the way they do it and our challenge is now to use it to go do these things that we want to go do as an airline and put in place the product with the people that do their job so well. We really want to. So just a long way for me saying, it was not an easy decision but I know it's the right decision for our shareholders."

We hit a little bit of a rough patch in February and March, where corporate demand in particular seemed a little weak, and I think a lot of airlines -- well, a every airline tended to see that the, I think, I actually, I think, there's 2 reasons for that as near as I can hypothesize, both of which have gotten better now so that's good news. The first 1 is we had a stock market that dropped, whatever it dropped, 10% or 12% as we said before, on a headline basis, whether it should or not that does affect travel demand, particularly corporate travel demand, which is easy to go. When you start to get worried when you travel and entertainment budget. As I do think that was one of the factors. It appears that the market has come back, that coast and booking demand has gotten stronger. Another thing that happened, which got talked about a little bit on our earnings call the last time, got asked a question about advantage which I know many people on this call think -- or were worried was problematic and I declined to answer it on the last call. The reason I declined to answer it on the last call. Well, the reason I declined to answer it is because there were no advantage fares in the market at the time. None of the airlines had advantage fares. They have all been canceled. So I don't want to talk about it. We went for about 3 months with no advantage fares in the market. That 3-month period actually coincided with the wealthy decline in revenue expectations across most of the all airlines. So we start to wonder if our decision to cancel advantage fares was really the correct revenue decision. But before we have made a final decision on that 1 of our competitors, I presumably concluded that it was also the wrong decision and put them back. So they've been back in the market now for a couple of weeks and the combination of those 2 things means that the last couple of weeks we've actually seen strengthening posting demand, not just the absolute demand but revenue. So we actually felt better about the revenue environment that we would have say 3 to 4 weeks ago. On the domestic front, I know that some have talked advanced book yields being up. our book to yields domestically for May, June, July and August are up year-over-year for all of those months. But I don't want to mislead anyone because that's been true for the past several months. The issue has not really been about advanced book yields. We've had advanced book yields domestically up. It's been a weak to close in yields. And there's still is weakness in close-in yields although we do have a pretty strong demand environment and bookings are a up a lot year-over-year but the yield is tending to fall as we get closer to departure."

I don't didn't really care how we got here, but the fares that I'm being asked to pay, particularly close in and to your point, they strike me as stupidly low. Notwithstanding airlines recalcitrance to discuss pricing, what is potentially wrong with the structure? Is it multisegment itineraries that are pricing too low? Is it the junk fares have been popping up at markets where discounters don't even exist? Is it something about minimum stay requirements? I mean the reason I ask is not in regards to what you might do differently, it's what we might be looking for, keeping an eye out for in terms of change as opposed to just monitoring for plain vanilla fare increases?"

But the fare environment has changed over the last couple of decades, one of the big -- probably I think the biggest change has been the lack of pricing [indiscernible] So historically, airlines had 14 day advantage purchases with Saturday night stays and that is an effective way to segment demand and offer business travelers great product, high-frequency, the availability to book last minute but also to be available to offer leisure fares that could fill the empty seats on airplanes that were below the average cost of flying the airplane but could go what would have otherwise been empty seats and it would have effectively segment the demand. Really because of the growth of low-cost carriers, those pricing fences have broken down across the board and lots of zero AP fares, lots of 1 way fares and more than anything, that's what, I think, has driven lower fares for business travel and for close and traffic. Now the ways to combat that are and to drive higher fares, basic and premium economy are 2 of the really, I think big levers for American Airlines in doing that. We're not going to have that really in place until next year. But today, when we -- we wanted to be competitive with others and so we have low fares in the market that have very few restrictions on them and there's no reason for a customer to pay more. And we're going to -- you get the exact same product whether you buy a $41 walk up fare or a $900 walk up fare and we're going to change that and we're going to have different products and the more your paying, the better benefits you're going to get. That's one of the really big things that we can do. Part of that -- part and parcel of that is investing the products and having a great product that customers are actually willing to pay for and pay more for. So that -- for those customers who aren't commodity customers, we have a lot of customers were commoditized. But for those who customers who are not commoditize, we can sell them a better product and be appropriately compensated for that. You also see changes going on in the industry like this stuff about fare combinability, which for the most part has been rollback now. But those are -- the fare combinability is an artifact of history that goes back to the 1960s when GDS were first built, and has had unintended consequences as the pricing environment change. So the fact that those kinds of changes are happening even if they happen in a 1 step forward, 2 steps back kind of process, are actual the long-term encouraging to me because we're moving to a world where we're getting away from just commoditizing the price of the product and getting to we will sell commoditized product for some customers but for other customers, we will be able to decommoditize the product and that's not going to happen overnight, that's got nothing happened this year but we're on a good path to get better and that's a structural change."

[indiscernible] Industry capacity and [indiscernible] , which are to do is best for American Airlines Smith said we have always try to give you guys the best 50-50 forecast that we can on our outlook for capacity growth. And in a world where we continue to see PRASM declines even though earnings have been growing for many quarters in a row, in a world of negative PRASM, we view that as indicative of supply and demand being misbalanced. And so as a result, we cut capacity historically. Turning to those other items, they're really hard to quantify. A credit card deal, I'm not going to try to quantify. You can look to what other deals have done and make your own guess as to what the American Airlines deal will be. The American Airlines loyalty program and our partnerships with the Citi and Barclays, we have the largest and best loyalty program in the world. And we're very proud of that and we have 2 great partners today and we're looking forward to making that even better for American Airlines, for our customers and for our bank partners. On the other items, some of those things are longer term like basic economy, premium economy, those are really 2017 initiatives for next year, again, hard to quantify. In the yield management area, those are the -- that's the kind of thing when we'll ultimately get everything completed that we're working on. It's probably -- we don't -- again, it's impossible to know for sure but probably worth 2 to 3 points PRASM, which is, I think, it should be worth 2 to 3 points of PRASM. But it's also hard to know when you'll finish that. You put a new yield management system in place, your placing something that's been there for 25 years, you're going to get to a better position in the end but all the patches and the things that have been built into the system for the past 25 years to fix this problem or that problem or this that's been worked well, you wrapup all those Band-Aids. And so you do take a few steps back sometimes before you can really get the system tuned and running. And that's probably a continuous process and never finishes. But we're right in the middle of starting a conversion process so it's probably more challenging for us in the short term than it would be in the normal symptom but they did in previous yield management, ultimately should be worth 2 or 3 points for us."

But our value -- or our job is to maximize shareholder value, and we know there are things that can be done better and particularly, as Scott has noted, on the revenue environment, we think there are brighter days ahead but we're not pleased with where we are now. It's not what we expect it to be at this point. None of us were looking out a year ago and thinking we'd see these kinds of revenue declines. But I'm also happy it's no the word projected this kind of revenue declines I don't think we would have projected $1.2 billion in earnings. So I don't know . It's a long answer, I'm not sure I can tell you why you what you think, Hunter. But I can tell you what we think and what we think is the near-term is really important but so is the long-term and it seems that times that we focus that you all have to focus more in the near term than we do.

It's just built into a hardwiring of the system and when we eliminate it for good reason, we great some unintended consequences with things like multicity ticketing and others.

If you go back and look over the past really going all the way back to, I think, before the financial crisis.

A lot of times that lag, I think part of that is you wind up with less capacity which is completely rationale. You wind up with less capacity, which is completely rational. You wind up with less capacity when oil prices go up and that leads to move this by Croatia leads to higher prices. Disappointed when oil prices fell that link went to the other direction as well, it did. And when oil prices fell, probably went up and fares went down. I think that, that is going to be in place going forward and kind of going back to the earlier question, I think, the investor focus and worry about PRASM is appropriate but essentially it is a worry that link won't exist. It's easy to say oil prices -- earnings are good right now but what if oil prices go up and revenues don't go up along with it? And, I think, that's really I would characterize investor worry about PRASM and I think that it's one of the important points for investing in airlines. If you believe that, it's a pretty investment. If you don't believe that, it's a harder investment. I happen to believe it, we all here believe it pretty strongly. I mean it's only a glamor. But if you look at this quarter, oil prices have gone up. They're still at really low levels. But as they gone up across quarter essentially every airline that I read the transcript for so far, it's something that you talk about reducing capacity. Those 2 things, I think, are correlated. And if it's rational, and so I think that we will see that link if the oil prices go up, that revenues will go up as well and I think that's sort of key to the investment thesis if you're an airline investor. If you believe that it's a pretty sister in the us if you don't believe that, I get the obsession the focus on near-term PRASM and worry about near-term PRASM."

It's unusual to look at that. That 1 place has become an exception to that but we continue to reduce capacity here, it's been in South America where we could see this disaster, catastrophic numbers coming and started to get ahead or try to get ahead of the curve on reducing capacity pretty significantly. And so of a lot of competitors continue to grow double digits. No the good news is that it appears to have stopped. It's gotten better enough in Brazil in particular that everyone is deciding to shrink. But I was frankly surprised at the competitive reaction in a place where you're having RASM decline to 40% 2 years in a row to see that.

I guess just wonder how you sort of apply that logic to today, right? Because if we were to think about, for instance, the domestic environment. In the second quarter, you saw about 6.4% revenue decline domestically and I appreciate that probably playing a role but may be you still have a mid-single-digit decline in your unit revenue in Q1. And that's on an industry capacity growth number that's adjusted for leap year and a domestic market of about 5%. And so if I go back and look historically, domestic airline revenue has grown at something like U.S. nominal GDP. So if you have kind of a low to single-digit -- low to mid-single-digit underlying revenue trend as result of just general economic activity and you couple that with a 5% supply growth number then I guess I would have expected something more like low single-digit kind of RASM declined as opposed to mid-single-digit RASM declined. So I guess, sorry for the long-winded question but, I think, the worry here isn't so much that capacity decisions have decoupled from fuel. It's more that pricing seems to have decoupled from what's going on with capacity and, I think, we're all just struggling to understand that?"

But a 5% PRASM decline even a couple of points to that is coming from DPIJ, I think, [indiscernible] better. I really do think it was the first question on the call. I go back to, I think, there were 2 big things that caused the second first quarter to be worse than it would otherwise would have been. One was the temporary change in the pricing structure where advantage fares have gone and now they are back. And second was we had a drop incorporate travel demand mid-quarter that coincided with the decline in the stock market. And we see that happen before and it comes back that's the bad news. The good news is as we move into April, close-in demand as those 2 things have changed, close-in demand actually has picked up pretty well. So fingers are crossed that we are going back to a more normal trendline of the relationship between supply and demand and revenue."

At the time, we were talking about was a real concern among -- on people's part that indeed you might see declines in the 2016 versus 2015 and at least articulated by some as a concern that we had peaked as an industry. And what I was trying to point out at that time was that was up our review. Indeed, what I said was we believe what I said pretty sure was 2015 has this phenomenon of incredibly quickly falling fuel prices that fell so fast that capacity couldn't catch it. And in a sense, the 2015 results because of that were higher than one would expect them to be the long-term. So well you might see therefore the grants in 2016 and in margins, you shouldn't view that as the industry had peaked rather you should view that as kind of a 1 term, onetime spike in margins in the industry and they would normalize in '16 to a level higher than '14 which by the way it appears they're going to. And therefore, 1 shouldn't assume that they will continue to fall from '16 to '17. So I think all that is still true and that going to try to make a forecast on '17 for you because I don't know. But that's what I was trying to point out that the 2015 -- the fact that 2016 was going to be lower than 2015, which turned out to be, I certainly wouldn't if you asked some sort of cyclical issue as opposed to kind a spike that we had in '15."

As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year.

And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts in capacity, traffic and load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected.
Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com.
A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

Thanks, everyone, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items at $1.2 billion, and it's slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 20",673,"Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everyone, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items at $1.2 billion, and it's slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 2015. But of more relevance to our shareholders, on an adjusted earnings per share basis, EPS actually grew 15% versus last year's record. That, of course, is because our share count is lower due to the share repurchase program we had in place.
And indeed, absolute earnings would have been slightly higher than last year's record, it's slightly lower, except for the company's unilateral decision to institute a profit-sharing program for our employees beginning in 2016. And our investors may question that decision. It's a big decision. And the fact of the matter is, we at American had attempted to transform our industry's compensation structure consistent with our view that our industry has been transformed. 
In short, we believe the best way, as most industries do, to pay our hardworking team is to give them an industry-leading base wage instead of lower wages, and then give them a share of the profits at the end of the year. But as it became more clear over time that our competitors were not going to do the same, it became a real issue for our team and, therefore, for our shareholders. And while the team understood the logic, we couldn't get past a collective view amongst the team that the company didn't appreciate their contributions to the success of the team, and that certainly wasn't the intent nor the view. So we implemented a unilateral 5% profit-sharing program. The first accrual of which is in these results. There's -- the accrual was $73 million were achieved. We're quite pleased with that and believe the shareholders should be as well. The fact of the matter is the announcement had the impact that we had hoped. Our team is excited. They're engaged. They are intent upon returning American to be the greatest airline in the world, and we're seeing it in the results. You can see it in the great job our team is doing running our airline, taking care of our customers. So I will begin by thanking them for their continued hard work and everything they're doing to return American to greatness and take care of our customers. 
As for the share repurchase, we returned more than $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, and our board has authorized a new $2 billion repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. 
Now look, we're purchasing our shares because we're bullish on the stock and our prospects at American. We think it's a great investment for a couple of the reasons: One, we continue to believe that the market does not seem to fully appreciate the transformation that's taken place in this industry. And as a result, we believe the industry is well undervalued. 
Second, we think American Airlines has more upside than anyone else in the industry. We're not done with the integration. We have -- we are making investments at a rate that no other airline has done in the past in the product and in our people, which will turn into our product. And that gives us upside that others don't have. So we're very bullish. 
But look, because we're bullish, it doesn't mean we are totally pleased with the current performance because we're not. In particular, we're disciplined in our revenue performance, on both an absolute level and relative to some of our peers. And Scott will take some time to explain the current situation and the outlook, but just know that we don't view the current revenue trends as either acceptable or long-term. If we did, we wouldn't be as bullish as we are. So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek to give you a lot more details, and then Scott will give you some color, and I will take questions. Derek?"

In our 10-Q and earnings press release filed this morning, we reported our first quarter 2016 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share. This compares to 2015 net",1792,"Yes, thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. In our 10-Q and earnings press release filed this morning, we reported our first quarter 2016 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share. This compares to 2015 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $1.2 billion or $0.0173 per diluted share. 
As we talked about on our last call, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company concluded that realization of substantially all of the deferred tax assets, principally net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs, was more likely than that. This was the basis for the company's strong financial performance since the merger and expectations of financial substain future profitability. Accordingly, the company reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2015. Starting with its first quarter of 2016 results, the company will be recognizing a provision for income tax that has substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. 
For 2016, quarterly net profit will not be comparable to net profit of 2015. As a result, we believe pretax profit, excluding net special items, is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance and net income. 
On net basis, our first quarter pretax profit excluding net special charges, was $1.22 billion, which resulted in record first quarter pretax margin of 12.9%. This compares to our 2015 first quarter pretax profit excluding net special charges of $1.25 billion and a pretax margin of 12.7%. 
As Doug talked about, excluding the effects of our special items and the noncash tax provision, our first quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was up 15% to $1.99 per share, reflecting a 15% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the first quarter of 2016 was 65.1 billion ASMs, up 3.6% from the same period in 2015 with mainline capacity up 3.1% and regional capacity was up 8.1%. We continue to make significant investments in our fleet renewal program, which has given the company the youngest and most modern fleet of the U.S. network airlines. By the end of this year, we expect the average age of our mainline fleet to fall below 10 years, well below any of our network competitors. In the first quarter of 2016, the company took delivery of 15 new mainline aircraft while retiring 19 mainline aircraft. The company also added 13 regional aircraft and removed 3 regional aircraft. This program will continue throughout the year when we expect to take delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft, while adding that 49 regional aircraft. And to keep our capacity in check, we expect to remove 86 mainline aircraft and 23 regional aircraft from our fleet during the year.
Our first quarter 2016 revenue continue to be negatively impacted by competitive capacity increases, principally in certain domestic markets, economic softness in Latin America and the impact of a stronger dollar in foreign markets. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $9.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $8.1 billion, down 4.2%, driven by 7.1% lower yields on a 3.6% increase in system capacity. 
Cargo revenues were down 16.8% to $162 million due primarily to a 15.3% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were relatively flat at $1.2 billion. 
Total RASM in the first quarter of 2016 was $0.145, down 7.3%, driven principally by a decline in passenger RASM of 7.5%, which Scott will talk about in a minute. 
As Doug mentioned in his remarks, on March 23, we introduced an employee profit-sharing program, which will pay out 5% of pretax profit, excluding special items, starting with our full year 2016 results. This program was retroactive to January 1 and accordingly, we recognize $73 million of profit sharing expense in the first quarter. The company also accelerated a contractual marked-to-market pay rate adjustment for the company's flight attendants and reach agreement with our dispatchers on a new contract in April. Costs associated with these rate adjustments and the profit-sharing program will be included in our forward CASM guidance that I'll discuss later.
Our first quarter financial results continue to reflect the significant savings from the year-over-year decline in jet fuel prices. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the first quarter of 2016, was down 34.1% to $1.20 per gallon. Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.1 billion, down 5.9% versus the same period last year due primarily to $607 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Operating expenses, excluding net special charges for the first quarter of 2016, were $8 billion, down 3.7% year-over-year. 
First quarter mainline CASM per -- cost per ASM, excluding net special charges, was $0.1141, down 6.9% year-over-year due primarily to lower fuel costs. Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0962 in the first quarter, up 1.4% year-over-year. This increase was due primarily to contractual labor rate increases, including for our customer service and race [ph] agents and the introduction of our profit-sharing plan. These rate increases were offset in part by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses.
Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding special items and fuel, was $0.1611 for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 2.2%, and our consolidated first quarter CASM was up 1%. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.9 billion and a $2.4 billion undrawn revolver capacity. 
The company also had $691 million classified in restricted cash. During the first quarter of 2016, we generated $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations and paid $310 million scheduled debt payments. As a reminder, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we provided our view on leverage and liquidity for American going forward. And particularly, we stated that in today's earnings and interest rate environment, liquidity was the most important metric we consider. And given our relative leverage, we expect to maintain a liquidity level of at least $6.5 billion. We also provided guidance with respect to where we are with our fleet rental program, access to attractive debt in the capital markets, ongoing share repurchase programs and our belief that American will produce sustained earnings. Our liquidity of $9.4 billion for the quarter end was up 8 -- up from $8.7 billion at the end of 2015 and was well in excess of the $6.5 billion liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. 
As previously mentioned, we believe it's important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
With respect to leverage, we look to metrics, such as net debt-to-EBITDAR, and with our planned aircraft financing this year, we continue to expect that on this metric, we will peak in 2016 and then begin to see this decline each year going forward as our capital spending declines. 
In early January, the company issued $1.1 billion in enhanced equipment trust certificates at a blended rate just below 4%. The proceeds for this financing were used to finance aircraft previously delivered in 2015. The company also raised approximately $4 billion -- or $400 million in other low-cost aircraft financing during the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company returned more than $1.6 billion to its shareholders through the repayment of $61 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.56 billion of common stock or 39.3 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid 2014, the company has returned approximately $6.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $6.1 billion and dividends of $0.5 billion. 
Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity words and shares distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 23% from 756.1 million at merger close to 585.7 million shares on March 31, 2016. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $850 million remaining on its current authorization and as a result, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. On a program-to-date basis, the company's Board of Directors has authorized a total of $9 billion of share repurchases.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, we continued to value our capacity and then our IR update issued 2 weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2.5%. Full year domestic capacity growth is expected to be up approximately 2.5% and international has been reduced from 6% down to 2.5%. By quarter, the first quarter is $62.6 billion -- or second quarter, $62.6 billion, excuse me, $64.8 billion in the third, $58.9 million in the fourth. On a regional breakdown, it's $8.01 billion in the second, $8.22 billion in the third and $8.08 billion in the fourth.
On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, to be up approximately 3% to 5% with the regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. Mainline CASM in the first and second quarter will be up between 4% and  6% and in the fourth quarter, up 3% to 5%. Regional CASM will be down by approximately 4% to 6% in the second quarter and down 3% to 5% in both the third and fourth quarter.
Based on the overall fuel curve of April 18, 2016, we expect to see another year of significant year-over-year fuel savings. In our second quarter, we expect $1.30 to $1.35; third quarter, $1.36 to $1.41; fourth quarter, $1.40 to $1.45. 
On the regional side, the second quarter, we have $1.35 to $1.40; third quarter $1.43 to $1.48; and the fourth quarter, $1.47 to $1.52. And based on these prices, we expect our 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year.
Using the midpoints of guidance we provided along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect our second quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 16%. The capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion will occur in the second quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect to invest $1.2 billion for nonaircraft CapEx, which includes investment to improve our product and the operations.
So in conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, we have strong first quarter results, which make an excellent start to 2016 while we still have a lot of work to do to complete our integration and our continued financial success as it's well-positioned for the years ahead. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Scott."
168569,330447003,961988,"American Airlines Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","American Airlines Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Derek. And I'd like to start by thanking our operations team and the 100,000 people of American Airlines that continue to make great strides. And in fact, the first quarter was our best operational quarter since the merger closed. Despite the fact",1026,"Thanks, Derek. And I'd like to start by thanking our operations team and the 100,000 people of American Airlines that continue to make great strides. And in fact, the first quarter was our best operational quarter since the merger closed. Despite the fact that we're years behind our competitors and starting the merger integration process, we've already gotten to a point where we're neck and neck for first place in departures and 0s, which we view as a primary metric for core operating reliability. And our other operating metrics were showing improvement as well with mishandled baggage rates down over 20% year-over-year and significant improvements in completion factor. 
But we know we can do even better. We have many initiatives and technology projects underway to further improve all of our operating metrics and are well on the path to operating the best airline in the world. On the revenue front, the first quarter continued the challenging revenue environment with PRASM down 7.5%. Domestically, our consolidated PRASM was down 5.3%. We saw the strongest performance year-over-year in Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago. The weakest performance, once again, was in Miami, although that's still really a function of declining connecting revenues from South America. 
Internationally, the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges made up 1.7 points of total system PRASM decline. So that is a smaller impact than we saw in fourth quarter as we're beginning to overlap the dollar appreciation from last year. 
The Atlantic was our best-performing international region with PRASM down 2.1%. While we're relatively pleased with that result, we expect capacity growth across the Atlantic this summer to drive some incremental pressure in this region. 
Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 16% on 29% ASM growth, with continued weakness in both Japan and China but positive year-over-year PRASM in South Korea. 
Latin PRASM was down 17%, but as it's been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela, where PRASM was down 39% and 48%, respectively. 
Looking forward, while the comps get easier in 2Q, the revenue environment remains challenging. We expect the revenue environment to remain challenging throughout 2016, but longer term, we feel quite positive about all the initiatives we have in place to drive higher revenues, including basic and premium economy, a new revenue base frequent flyer program, $3 billion in new product investments, our continued fleet modernization program and the best people in the industry who are focused on delivering the best customer service. 
We also recognize that the market is rightly concerned about getting back to positive PRASM, and we're also focused on that as an explicit internal goal. I think that time line is unfortunately has been pushed into next year, and some of the long-term initiatives I described will make a big difference in that regard in 2017. But we'd also like to find ways to accelerate the positive trends into this year. Doing so will require a fair level of sequential improvement. But one of the areas were focused on in the near term, it include implementing a new demand forecasting system in yield management. This initiative where we're all -- we'll know will ultimately produce much better results. But as we've implemented this, in the recent past, we've had some ""one step forward, 2 steps back"" issues with the new system. 
We're cautiously optimistic that we're through some of the tipping pains and, in fact, as we look out into the summer, our PRASM forecast for June and beyond looks much better than April and May. As most of you know, we're also in the middle of negotiations for a new credit card deal. While I won't predict on this call when or even if we'll ever get a deal done, all of our large players have done new deals in the past couple of years, and we expect a similar larger tailwind for American Airlines when we do, ultimately, get a new deal done. 
Further, we also adjust capacity in a world where we see declining demand. American Airlines was the slowest-growing airline in the United States last year, and as you've seen for several quarters in a row, we can continue to reduce our capacity plan in light of declining year-over-year PRASM. 
So while we believe the long-term outlook is bright and even have some near-term opportunities that could drive out performance, I know that many people on this call are a little more focused just on 2Q revenues. So for the second quarter, total scheduled capacity remains elevated in all regions. And while capacity growth rates were down slightly from the first quarter levels, total capacity is still growing faster than the economies in all regions of the world. 
As we move into the back half of the year, however, we still expect capacity growth rates to moderate further from the first-half level. 
As we experienced throughout 2015, we continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas, and we don't expect that to moderate until September. And while the comps get easier, the economy, currencies and revenue environment in Brazil and Venezuela both continue to deteriorate on a sequential basis. Hearing all this, we expect our system PRASM to decline 6% to 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, the near-term revenue environment remains challenging. While we're delivering solid bottom line results, we know that getting back to PRASM growth is important to our near- and long-term future. To do that, we are making smart investments in our product and continuing to modernize our fleet. We have an intense focus on improving our operations, and we're starting to see the results in our operating metrics. And we're investing in our people. Our team members are responsible for delivering great service to our customers each and everyday. 
In the near term, we're focused on better day-to-day execution in revenue management and in getting our new yield management system properly tuned. When you put it all together, we feel very good about the foundation that we're building for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operation and drive higher revenues."

And given what we're trying to accomplish to pull everyone together and help them understand that, indeed, it's different, much like we're trying to, with everyone of our partners, help them understand the world is different. 
What had happened is we've lost a part of the team not because -- they understood analytically the argument we laid out, and that we've laid out for you and that we lay out all the time. And it's certainly past our, ""looking them in the eye test,"" which is important to us. We also talk about it with the team. We look our employees in the eye and tell them why we made the decisions, and we could do that extremely well. We just didn't like the look we were getting back on this one. I mean, the employees got it with their brains but they didn't get it in their hearts. And it really felt like -- again, largely because, while our other -- while our competitors kind of were moving in our direction, they weren't going to the point that we're in. And the other airlines have in place this profit-sharing programs, and we did not. And it felt to our team like we -- well, they understood, again, the logic, dealt [ph] as though we weren't appreciating their contribution to the bottom line, which is the last thing we were trying to accomplish. So what we realized is if we were going to really get our team engaged and excited, which is an imperative to accomplishing all we want to accomplish and all of the things Scott talked about that we're working on, to get -- or to compete against the other airlines, and particularly for premium travelers, we had to have our team engaged and excited, and this was holding us back. So I firmly belief it's in our shareholders' best interest to do it. We wouldn't have done it otherwise. We have indeed seen an uplift in engagement and excitement because of this. Not so much, I don't think, because of the actual dollars involved, just because it proved what our employees wanted to believe, that indeed, it is different. And that we will listen. And that we will do things even though we've made -- even though we've taken strong positions, if it gets to the point that we think it's not working, we're willing to revisit those decisions. So all those things have had a positive impact on the team. I think that's good for -- I know it's good for our shareholders. It's impossible to quantify. And it's also early. The real challenge to the team is to not build on it. This is temporary. While the profit sharing is -- will stay in place, the feeling of instituting profit sharing is not going to stay in place. It will become just, I imagine, over time, just part of everyone's compensation that they -- that -- in the way they view it. And our challenge is now to use it to go do the things that we want to go do as an airline and put in place the product with the people that do their job so well. And we want to. So just a long way of me saying, it wasn't an easy decision, but I know it's the right decision for our shareholders."

We hit a little bit of a rough patch in February and March, where corporate demand, in particular, seemed a little weak, and I think a lot of airlines -- well, every airline tended to see that. I think, actually, I think, there's 2 reasons for that as near as I can hypothesize, both of which have gotten better now, so that's the good news. The first one is, we had a stock market that dropped, whatever it dropped, 10% or 12% [indiscernible]. As we said before, on a headline basis, whether it should or not, that does affect travel demand, particularly corporate travel demand, which it's easy to go when you start to get worried when you're in your travel and entertainment budget. 
As I do think that was one of the factors, it appears that the market has come back. That close-in booking demand has gotten stronger. 
Another thing that happened, which got talked about a little bit on our earnings call the last time, I got asked a question about advantage fares, which I know many people on this call think -- or were worried was problematic, and I declined to answer it on the last call. The reason I declined to answer it is because there were no advantage fares on the market at the time. None of the airlines had advantage fares. They've been -- all have been canceled. And so I didn't want to talk about it. 
We went for about 3 months with no advantage fares in the market. That 3-month period actually coincided with the wealthy decline in revenue expectations across most of the all airlines. So we were starting to wonder if our decision to cancel advantage fares was really a correct revenue decision. But before we have made a final decision on that, one of our competitors, I presumably concluded, that it was also the wrong decision and put them back. So they've been back in the market now for a couple of weeks. And the combination of those 2 things means that in the last couple of weeks, we've actually seen strengthening close-in demand, not just absolute demand, but revenue. So we actually felt better about the revenue environment than we would have, say, 3 to 4 weeks ago. 
On the domestic front, I know that some have talked advanced book yields being up. This is true for us, too. Our booked yields domestically for May, June, July and August are up year-over-year for all of those months. But I don't want to mislead anyone because that's been true for the past several months. The issue has not really been about advanced book yields. We've had advanced book yields domestically up. It's been about weak close-in yields. And there still is weakness in close-in yields, although we do have a pretty strong demand environment. And bookings are a up a lot year-over-year, but the yield is tending to fall as we get closer to departure."

I don't really care how we got here, but the fares that I'm being asked to pay, particularly close-in, and to your point, they strike me as stupidly low. Notwithstanding airlines recalcitrance to discuss pricing, what is potentially wrong with the structure? Is it multi-segment itineraries that are pricing too low? Is it the junk fares have been popping up in markets where discounters don't even exist? Is it something about minimum stay requirements? I mean, the reason I ask is not in regards to what you might do differently, it's what we might be looking for, keeping an eye out for in terms of change as opposed to just monitoring for plain vanilla fare increases?"

One of the big -- probably, I think the biggest change has been the lack of pricing fences. So historically, airlines had a 14-day advance purchases with Saturday night stays, and that was an effective way to segment demand and offer business travelers great product, high-frequency, the availability to book last minute, but also to be available to offer leisure fares that could fill the empty seats on airplanes that were below the average cost of flying the airplanes but could go fill what would have otherwise been empty seats, and it would have effectively segment the demand. Really, because of the growth of low-cost carriers, those pricing fences have broken down across-the-board, and lots of 0 AP fares, lots of one-way fares and more than anything, that's what, I think, has driven lower fares for business travel and for close-in and traffic. 
Now the ways to combat that are -- and to drive higher fares, basic and premium economy are 2 of the really, I think, big levers for American Airlines in doing that. We're not going to have that really in place until next year. But today, when we -- we wind up having to be competitive with others, and so we have low fares in the market that have very few restrictions on them, and there's no reason for a customer to pay more. And we're going to -- you get the exact same product, whether you buy a $41 walk-up fare or a $900 walk up fare. And we're going to change that. And we're going to have different products. And the more you're paying, the better benefits you're going to get. That's one of the really big things that we can do. Part of that -- part and parcel of that is investing in the products and having a great product that customers are actually willing to pay for and pay more for. So that for those customers who aren't commodity customers, we have a lot of our customers who are commoditized. But for those who customers who are not commoditized, we can sell them a better product and be appropriately compensated for that. 
You also see changes going on in the industry like this stuff about fare combinability, which, for the most part, has been rolled back now. But those are -- the fare combinability is an artifact of history that goes back to the 1960s when GDS were first built and has had unintended consequences as the pricing environment change. So the fact that those kinds of changes are happening, even if they happen in a step -- ""one step forward, two steps back"" kind of process are actually long-term encouraging to me because we're moving to a world where we're getting away from just commoditizing the price of the product and getting to we will sell a commoditized product for some customers, but for other customers, we will be able to decommoditize the product, and that's not going to happen overnight. That's got nothing happened this year, but we're on a good path to get there. And that's a structural change."

Our industry capacity, for instance, and just say that, look, we tried to do what's best for American Airlines, as we said. We always try to give you guys the best 50-50 forecast that we can on our outlook for capacity growth. And in a world where we continue to see PRASM declines, even though earnings have been growing for many quarters in a row, in a world of negative PRASM, we view that as indicative of supply and demand being misbalanced. And so as a result, we've cut capacity historically. 
Turning to those other items, they're really hard to quantify. A credit card deal, I'm not going to try to quantify. You can look to what other deals we have done and make your own guess as to what the American Airlines deal will be. The American Airlines loyalty program and our partnerships with the Citi and Barclays, we have the largest and best loyalty program in the world, and we're very proud of that. And we have 2 great partners today, and we're looking forward to making that even better for American Airlines, for our customers and for our bank partners. 
On the other items, some of those things are longer-term, like basic economy, premium economy. Those are really 2017 initiatives for next year, again, hard to quantify. In the yield management area, those are the -- that's the kind of thing that when we'll ultimately get everything completed that we're working on. It's probably -- we don't -- it's, again, impossible to know for sure but probably worth 2 to 3 points of PRASM, which I think, it should be worth 2 to 3 points of PRASM. But it's also hard to know when you will finish that. Yes, you put a new yield management system in place. You're replacing something that's been there for 25 years. You're going to get to a better position in the end, but all the patches and things that have been built into the system for the past 25 years to fix this problem or that problem or this place that didn't work worked well, year, you wrap up all those Band-Aids, and so you do take a few steps back sometimes before you can really get the system tuned and running. And that's, frankly, a continuous process. It never finishes. But we're right in the middle of starting a conversion process, so it's probably more challenging for us in the short term than it would be in the normal, say, time. But I think, in previous yield management, ultimately, it should be worth 2 to 3 points for us."

But look, if I was an investor who had a short-term horizon on trading, I would care about what next -- what tomorrow's revenue look like. And that's a lot of who you have to deal with, and those are our shareholders we care about them as well. But our job is to maximize long-term shareholder value, and that doesn't mean at all that we ignore the near term, and I'm not -- none of us would suggest that we are. But this is what I try to say in my comments. Just because we're bullish about the future don't take that to mean that we're entirely pleased with the current environment because we're not. We just -- I just -- we just happen to believe that the long-term prospects for the stock don't -- are not reflected in the current price.

Our job is to run the airline for the long term. We are very excited about the long term. We are not pleased with the current term. Again, I shouldn't say we're not pleased. We're actually making $1.2 billion in the quarter is not something we're unhappy about. But our value -- or our job is to maximize shareholder value, and we know there are things that we -- that can be done better. And particularly, as Scott has noted, on the revenue environment, we think there are brighter days ahead, but we're not pleased with where we are now. It's not what we expect it to be at this point. None of us were looking out a year ago and thinking we'd see these kinds of revenue declines. But I'm also happy to report that if we -- if someone would have projected this kind of revenue declines, I don't think they would have projected $1.2 billion in earnings. So I don't know. It's a long answer, and I'm not sure I can tell you why you what you think, Hunter. But what I -- I can tell you what we think, and what we think is the near term is really important but so is the long term. And it seems at times that we focus that you all have to focus more in the near term than we do. And so I don't think that's inconsistent. I don't think that's a disconnect. I just think it's a different perspective of time horizon."

So this industry, Scott, has a track record of making really good transformational changes when things are really painful and bad. So I'm wondering why we're using a pricing system that dates back to the '80s based on algorithms that might not even apply anymore when the industry structure has completely overhauled. So is it time to start thinking transformational stuff here in terms of how you price your ticket? Maybe it's a 5-year initiative, I don't know.

I think we are doing things that maybe they're not big enough to be called transformational but they're certainly evolutionary.

Even things like getting rid of fare -- changing fare combinability and trying to get a better pricing structures through eliminating fare combinability has the potential to be transformational. We're stuck to some degree with we still sell a huge percentage of our ticket through GDSs and through even our own reservation systems, systems that were built and architected in the 1960s. And this fare combinability is one of those things. It's just built into a hardwiring of the system. And when we eliminate it for good reason, we create some unintended consequences with things like multicity ticketing and others. We're all -- we're running hard, we're not the only one. Other airlines, too, are running hard to change the way we price and to be able to do things to, in particular, I think, decommoditize the product and change the way airline pricing has worked historically. But we're working with these old mainframe systems, and it takes us time to get that done. It's not just us, it takes our partners' time, it takes SABRE time, it takes AmEx GlobalTravel time, all the changes because we're working in these old systems. And it's frustrating to us that we can't get these things done quicker because of great ideas about how to sell the product more effectively, about how to be able to, at the same airplane, compete with Spirit Airlines and at the same time, sell tickets to our premium customers who want a better product than they could ever possibly get on an airline like Spirit.

Look, you can go back and look over the past really going all the way back to, I think, before the financial crisis and you've seen oil prices go up, you've seen fares go up with a lag, with a 3- to 6-month lag. A lot of times that lag, I mean, I think part of that is that you wind up with less capacity, which is completely rational. You wind up with less capacity when oil prices go up and that leads to a move in the supply curve, which leads to higher prices. I was disappointed when oil prices fell, but that link went  the other direction as well, it did. And when oil prices fell, supply went up and fares went down. I think that, that is going to be in place going forward. And kind of going back to the earlier question, I think, the investor focus and worry about PRASM is appropriate, but essentially it is a worry that, that link won't exist. It's easy to say oil prices -- earnings are good right now, but what if oil prices go up and revenues don't go up along with it? And I think, that's really, I would characterize investor worry about PRASM. And I think it's one of the important points for investing in airlines. If you believe that, it's a pretty easy investment. If you don't believe that, it's a harder investment. I happen to believe it. We all here believe it pretty strongly. I mean, it's only a glimmer, but even if you look at this quarter, oil prices have gone up. They're still at really low levels. But as they've gone up across quarter essentially every airline that I read the transcript for so far, it's something they talk about reducing capacity. Those 2 things, I think, are correlated. And if it's rational, and so I think that we will see that link. And if oil prices go up, that revenues will go up as well. And I think that's sort of key to the investment thesis if you're an airline investor. If you believe that, it's a pretty easy story to say yes. And if you don't believe that, I get the focus on near-term PRASM and worry about near-term PRASM."

We're here to be the most profitable and the best."" So if indeed that's the case, that we were unprofitable and when we -- and we therefore reduced service to a market, and it was later replaced by someone else, that's what's supposed to happen. We couldn't be profitable there. And someone else wants to give it a shot. That's what competition is. So I wouldn't be particularly concerned by that, but I'm also not certain we agree with the premise as much as stated. Scott, anything to add?"

And therefore, our capacity decisions are just about what is going to happen with our profitability, and we're not looking at somebody is going to try to backfill it or market share changes. It's unusual to look at that. If there's one place that's become an exception to that, that we continue to reduce capacity here, it's been in South America, where we could see this disaster, catastrophic numbers coming and started to get ahead or try to get ahead of the curve on reducing capacity pretty significantly. And so a lot of competitors continue to grow double digits. Now the good news is that appears to have stopped. It's gotten bad enough in Brazil, in particular, that everyone is deciding to shrink. But I was frankly surprised at the competitive reaction in a place where you're having RASM decline to 40% 2 years in a row to see that. But almost everywhere else, we look at the world and just say, here's -- whatever is best for American Airlines is going to be the same no matter what the competitive response is."

I guess, I just wonder how you sort of apply that logic to today, right? Because I mean, if we just were to think about, for instance, the domestic environment, in the second quarter, you saw about a 6.5% revenue decline domestically, and I appreciate that DPIJ is probably playing a role. But maybe you still have a mid-single-digit decline in your unit revenue in Q1. And that's on an industry capacity growth number that's adjusted for leap year and the domestic market of about 5%. And so if I to go back and look historically, domestic airline revenue has grown at something like U.S. nominal GDP. So if you have kind of a low to single digit -- low to mid-single-digit underlying revenue trend as a result of just general economic activity and you couple that with a 5% supply growth number, then I guess I would have expected something more like a low single-digit kind of RASM decline as opposed to a mid-single-digit RASM decline. So just, I guess, sorry for the long-winded question, but the -- I think, the worry here isn't so much that capacity decisions have decoupled from fuel. It's more that pricing seems to have decoupled from what's going on with capacity, and I think, we're all just struggling to understand that."

The first quarter, sort of, I guess, across the industry domestically was weaker than, I think, you would have thought fundamentals would suggest. For us, RASM -- consolidated domestic RASM was down 5.3%. I think you referred to the mainline number. But a 5% PRASM decline, even a couple of points to that is coming from DPIJ, I thought it was better. I really do think -- I think it was the first question on the call. I'd go back to, I think, there were 2 big things that caused the first quarter to be worse than it otherwise would have been. One was the temporary change in the pricing structure where advantage fares were gone and now they're back. And second was we had a drop in corporate travel demand mid-quarter that coincided with the decline in the stock market. And we see that happened before, and it comes back. That's the bad news. The good news is as we move into April, close-in demand -- as those 2 things have changed, close-in demand actually has picked up pretty well. So our fingers are crossed that we're going to be back to a more normal trend line of the relationship between supply and demand and revenue."

At the time, we were talking about was a real concern among -- on people's part that indeed you might see declines in 2016 versus 2015, and at least articulated by some as a concern that we had peaked as an industry. And what I was trying to point out at that time was that's not -- that wasn't our view. Indeed, what I said -- we believe it when I said it I'm pretty sure was 2015 had this phenomenon of incredibly quickly falling fuel prices that fell so fast, that capacity couldn't catch it. And in a sense, the 2015 results, because of that, were higher than one would expect them to be in the long term. So while you might see therefore declines into 2016 and margins, you shouldn't view that as the industry had peaked rather you should view that as kind of a 1 term, onetime spike in margins in the industry and they would normalize in '16 to a level higher than '14, which by the way it appears they're going to. And therefore, one shouldn't assume that they would continue to fall from '16 into '17. So I think all of that is still true, but I'm not going to try and make a forecast on '17 for you because I don't know. But that's what I was trying to point out that 2015 -- the fact that 2016 was going to be lower than 2015, which it's turned out to be, I certainly wouldn't view as some sort of cyclical issue as opposed to rather than this kind of spike that we had in '15."

As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts in capacity, traffic and load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected.
Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com.
A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

168569,330447003,962083,"American Airlines Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","American Airlines Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items, of $1.2 billion. That is slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 2",676,"Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items, of $1.2 billion. That is slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 2015. But of more relevance to our shareholders, on an adjusted earnings per share basis, EPS actually grew 15% versus last year's record. That, of course, is because our share count is lower due to the share repurchase program we've had in place.
And indeed, absolute earnings would have been slightly higher than last year's record, instead of slightly lower, except for the company's unilateral decision to institute a profit-sharing program for our employees beginning in 2016. I know investors may question that decision. It's a big decision. And the fact of the matter is we, at American, had attempted to transform our industry's compensation structure consistent with our view that our industry had been transformed. 
In short, we believe the best way, as most industries do, to pay our hardworking team is to give them an industry-leading base wage instead of lower wages, and then give them a share of the profits at the end of the year. But as it became more clear over time that our competitors were not going to do the same, it became a real issue for our team and, therefore, for our shareholders. And while the team understood the logic, we just couldn't get past a collective view amongst the team that the company didn't appreciate their contributions to the success of the team, and that certainly wasn't the intent, nor the view. So we implemented a unilateral 5% profit-sharing program. The first accrual of which is in these results. There's -- the accrual was $73 million for our team. We're quite pleased with that and believe you, as shareholders, should be as well. The fact of the matter is the announcement had the impact that we had hoped. Our team is excited. They're engaged. They are intent upon returning American to be the greatest airline in the world, and we're seeing it in the results. You can see it in the great job our team is doing of running our airline, taking care of our customers. So I will begin by thanking them for their continued hard work and everything they're doing to return American to greatness and take care of our customers. 
As for the share repurchase, we returned more than $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, and our board has authorized a new $2 billion repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. 
Now look, we're purchasing our shares because we're bullish on the stock and our prospects at American. We think it's a great investment for a couple reasons: One, we continue to believe that the market does not seem to fully appreciate the transformation that's taken place in this industry. And as a result, we believe the industry is well undervalued. 
Second, we think American Airlines has more upside than anyone else in the industry. We're not done with the integration. We have -- we are making investments at a rate that no other airline has done in the past in the product and in our people, which will turn into our product. And that gives us upside that others don't have. So we're very bullish. 
But look, because we're bullish, that doesn't mean we are totally pleased with the current performance because we're not. In particular, we're disappointed in our revenue performance, on both an absolute level and relative to some of our peers. And Scott will take some time to explain the current situation and the outlook, but just know that we don't view the current revenue trends as either acceptable or long-term. If we did, we wouldn't be as bullish as we are. So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek to give you a lot more details, and then Scott will give you some color, and then we'll take questions. Derek?"

This compares to 2015 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $1.2 billion or $0.0173 (sic) [ $1.73 ] per diluted share. 
As we talked about on our last call, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company concluded that realization of substantially all of the deferred tax assets, principally net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs, was more likely than that. This was the basis for the company's strong financial performance since the merger and expectations of financial substained (sic) [sustained] future profitability. Accordingly, the company reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2015. Starting with its first quarter of 2016 results, the company will be recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. 
For 2016, quarterly net profit will not be comparable to net profit of 2015. As a result, we believe pretax profit, excluding net special items, is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance and net income. 
On that basis, our first quarter pretax profit, excluding net special charges, was $1.22 billion, which resulted in record first quarter pretax margin of 12.9%. This compares to our 2015 first quarter pretax profit, excluding net special charges, of $1.25 billion and a pretax margin of 12.7%. 
As Doug talked about, excluding the effects of our special items and the noncash tax provision, our first quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was up 15% to $1.99 per share, reflecting a 15% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the first quarter of 2016 was 65.1 billion ASMs, up 3.6% from the same period in 2015 with mainline capacity up 3.1% and regional capacity was up 8.1%. We continue to make significant investment in our fleet renewal program, which has given the company the youngest and most modern fleet of the U.S. network airlines. By the end of this year, we expect the average age of our mainline fleet to fall below 10 years, well below any of our network competitors. In the first quarter of 2016, the company took delivery of 15 new mainline aircraft while retiring 19 mainline aircraft. The company also added 13 regional aircraft and removed 3 regional aircraft. This program will continue throughout the year when we expect to take delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft, while adding that 49 regional aircraft. And to keep our capacity in check, we expect to remove 86 mainline aircraft and 23 regional aircraft from our fleet during the year.
Our first quarter 2016 revenue continued to be negatively impacted by competitive capacity increases, principally in certain domestic markets, economic softness in Latin America and the impact of a stronger dollar in foreign markets. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $9.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $8.1 billion, down 4.2%, driven by 7.1% lower yields on a 3.6% increase in system capacity. 
Cargo revenues were down 16.8% to $162 million due primarily to a 15.3% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were relatively flat at $1.2 billion. 
Total RASM in the first quarter of 2016 was $0.145, down 7.3%, driven principally by a decline in passenger RASM of 7.5%, which Scott will talk about in a minute. 
As Doug mentioned in his remarks, on March 23, we introduced an employee profit-sharing program, which will pay out 5% of pretax profit, excluding special items, starting with our full year 2016 results. This program was retroactive to January 1 and accordingly, we recognized $73 million of profit sharing expense in the first quarter. The company also accelerated a contractual marked-to-market pay rate adjustment for the company's flight attendants and reached agreement with our dispatchers on a new contract in April. Costs associated with these rate adjustments and the profit-sharing program will be included in our forward CASM guidance that I'll discuss later.
Our first quarter financial results continue to reflect the significant savings from the year-over-year decline in jet fuel prices. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the first quarter of 2016, was down 34.1% to $1.20 per gallon. Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.1 billion, down 5.9% versus the same period last year due primarily to $607 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Operating expenses, excluding net special charges for the first quarter of 2016, were $8 billion, down 3.7% year-over-year. 
First quarter mainline CASM per -- cost per ASM, excluding net special charges, was $0.1141, down 6.9% year-over-year due primarily to lower fuel costs. Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0962 in the first quarter, up 1.4% year-over-year. This increase was due primarily to contractual labor rate increases, including for our customer service and res agents and the introduction of our profit-sharing plan. These rate increases were offset in part by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses.
Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding special items and fuel, was $0.1611 for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 2.2%, and our consolidated first quarter CASM was up 1%. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.9 billion and a $2.4 billion undrawn revolver capacity. 
The company also had $691 million classified in restricted cash. During the first quarter of 2016, we generated $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations and paid $310 million in scheduled debt payments. As a reminder, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we provided our view on leverage and liquidity for American going forward. And particularly, we stated that in today's earnings and interest rate environment, liquidity was the most important metric we consider. And given our relative leverage, we expect to maintain a liquidity level of at least $6.5 billion. We also provided guidance with respect to where we are with our fleet rental program, access to attractive debt in the capital markets, ongoing share repurchase programs and our belief that American will produce sustained earnings. Our liquidity of $9.4 billion for the quarter end was up 8 -- up from $8.7 billion at the end of 2015 and was well in excess of the $6.5 billion liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. 
As previously mentioned, we believe it's important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage in that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
With respect to leverage, we look to metrics, such as net debt-to-EBITDAR, and with our planned aircraft financing this year, we continue to expect that on this metric, we will peak in 2016 and then begin to see this decline each year going forward as our capital spending declines. 
In early January, the company issued $1.1 billion in enhanced equipment trust certificates at a blended rate just below 4%. The proceeds for this financing were used to finance aircraft previously delivered in 2015. The company also raised approximately $4 billion -- or $400 million in other low-cost aircraft financing during the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company returned more than $1.6 billion to its shareholders through the repayment of $61 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.56 billion of common stock or 39.3 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $6.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $6.1 billion and dividends of $0.5 billion. 
Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and shares distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 23% from 756.1 million at merger close to 585.7 million shares on March 31, 2016. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $850 million remaining on its current authorization and as a result, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. On a program-to-date basis, the company's Board of Directors has authorized a total of $9 billion of share repurchases.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, we continue to value our capacity and in our IR update, issued 2 weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2.5%. Full year domestic capacity growth is expected to be up approximately 2.5% and international has been reduced from 6% down to 2.5%. By quarter, the first quarter is $62.6 billion -- or second quarter, $62.6 billion, excuse me, $64.8 billion in the third, $58.9 million in the fourth. On a regional breakdown, it's $8.01 billion in the second, $8.22 billion in the third and $8.08 billion in the fourth.
On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, to be up approximately 3% to 5% with the regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. Mainline CASM in the first and second quarter will be up between 4% and 6% and in the fourth quarter, up 3% to 5%. Regional CASM will be down by approximately 4% to 6% in the second quarter and down 3% to 5% in both the third and fourth quarter.
Based on the overall fuel curve of April 18, 2016, we expect to see another year of significant year-over-year fuel savings. In the second quarter, we expect $1.30 to $1.35; third quarter, $1.36 to $1.41; fourth quarter, $1.40 to $1.45. 
On the regional side, the second quarter, we have $1.35 to $1.40; third quarter $1.43 to $1.48; and the fourth quarter, $1.47 to $1.52. And based on these prices, we expect our 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year.
Using the midpoints of guidance we provided along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect our second quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 16%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion will occur in the second quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect to invest $1.2 billion for nonaircraft CapEx, which includes investment to improve our product and the operations.
So in conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, we have strong first quarter results, which make an excellent start to 2016. While we still have a lot of work to do to complete our integration and our continued financial success has us well-positioned for the years ahead. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Scott."
168569,330447003,962083,"American Airlines Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","American Airlines Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Derek. And I'd like to start by thanking our operations team and the 100,000 people of American Airlines that continue to make great strides. And in fact, the first quarter was our best operational quarter since the merger closed. Despite the fact",1025,"Thanks, Derek. And I'd like to start by thanking our operations team and the 100,000 people of American Airlines that continue to make great strides. And in fact, the first quarter was our best operational quarter since the merger closed. Despite the fact that we're years behind our competitors and starting the merger integration process, we've already gotten to the point where we're neck-and-neck for first place in departures and zeros, which we view as a primary metric for core operating reliability. And our other operating metrics are showing improvement as well with mishandled baggage rates down over 20% year-over-year and significant improvements in completion factor. 
But we know we can do even better. We have many initiatives and technology projects underway to further improve all of our operating metrics and are well on the path to operating the best airline in the world.
On the revenue front, the first quarter continued the challenging revenue environment with PRASM down 7.5%. Domestically, our consolidated PRASM was down 5.3%. We saw the strongest performance year-over-year in Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago. The weakest performance, once again, was in Miami, although that's still really a function of declining connecting revenues from South America. 
Internationally, the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges made up 1.7 points of total system PRASM decline. So that is a smaller impact than we saw in fourth quarter as we're beginning to overlap the dollar appreciation from last year. 
The Atlantic was our best-performing international region with PRASM down 2.1%. While we're relatively pleased with that result, we expect capacity growth across the Atlantic this summer to drive some incremental pressure in this region. 
Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 16% on 29% ASM growth, with continued weakness in both Japan and China but positive year-over-year PRASM in South Korea. 
Latin PRASM was down 17%, but as it's been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela, where PRASM was down 39% and 48%, respectively. 
Looking forward, while the comps get easier in 2Q, the revenue environment remains challenging. We expect the revenue environment to remain challenging throughout 2016, but longer term, we feel quite positive about all the initiatives we have in place to drive higher revenues, including basic and premium economy, a new revenue base frequent flyer program, $3 billion in new product investments, our continued fleet modernization program and the best people in the industry who are focused on delivering the best customer service. 
We also recognize that the market is rightly concerned about getting back to positive PRASM, and we're also focused on that as an explicit internal goal. I think that time line has unfortunately been pushed into next year, and some of the long-term initiatives I describe will make a big difference in that regard in 2017. But we'd also like to find ways to accelerate the positive PRASM trends into this year. Doing so will require a fair level of sequential improvement. But one of the areas that we're focused on in the near term, include implementing a new demand forecasting system in yield management. This initiative where we're all -- we'll know will ultimately produce much better results. But as we've implemented this, in the recent past, we've had some ""1 step forward, 2 steps back"" issues with the new system. 
We're cautiously optimistic that we're through some of the teething pains and, in fact, as we look out into the summer, our PRASM forecast for June and beyond looks much better than April and May. As most of you know, we're also in the middle of negotiations for a new credit card deal. While I won't predict on this call when or even if we'll ever get a deal done, all of our large competitors have done new deals in the past couple of years, and we expect a similar large tailwind for American Airlines when we do, ultimately, get a new deal done. 
Further, we also adjust capacity in a world where we see declining demand. American Airlines was the slowest-growing airline in the United States last year, and as you've seen for several quarters in a row, we can continue to reduce our capacity plan in light of declining year-over-year PRASM. 
So while we believe the long-term outlook is bright and even have some near-term opportunities that could drive out performance, I know that many people on this call are a little more focused just on 2Q revenues. So for the second quarter, total scheduled capacity remains elevated in all regions. And while capacity growth rates were down slightly from the first quarter levels, total capacity is still growing faster than the economies in all regions of the world. 
As we move into the back half of the year, however, we still expect capacity growth rates to moderate further from the first-half level. 
As we experienced throughout 2015, we continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas, and we don't expect that to moderate until September. And while the comps get easier, the economy, currencies and revenue environment in Brazil and Venezuela both continue to deteriorate on a sequential basis. Given all this, we expect our system PRASM to decline 6% to 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, the near-term revenue environment remains challenging. While we're delivering solid bottom line results, we know that getting back to PRASM growth is important to our near- and long-term future. To do that, we are making smart investments in our product and continuing to modernize our fleet. We have an intense focus on improving our operations, and we're starting to see the results in our operating metrics. And we're investing in our people. Our team members are responsible for delivering great service to our customers each and every day. 
In the near term, we're focused on better day-to-day execution in revenue management and in getting our new yield management system properly tuned. When you put it all together, we feel very good about the foundation that we're building for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operation and drive higher revenues."

We're not in a world where we're saying, keep capacity in place, just taking a near-term perspective on cash flow or anything else. We are focused on getting to cash flow or PRASM-positive.

What I can tell you is this, we'd lost part of the team, and it's really important, particularly at this airline, given the future -- given the history that the team had gone through. And given what we're trying to accomplish to pull everyone together and help them understand that, indeed, it's different, much like we're trying to, with every one of our partners, help them understand that the world is different. What had happened is we'd lost a part of the team not because -- they understood analytically the argument we laid out, and that we've laid out for you and that we lay out all the time. And it certainly passed our, ""look them in the eye test"" which was important to us. We all talk about it with the team. We need to look our employees in the eye and tell them why we made the decisions, and we could do that extremely well. We just didn't like the look we were getting back on this one. I mean, the employees got it with their brains but they didn't get it in their hearts. And it really felt like -- again, largely because, while our other -- while our competitors kind of were moving in our direction, they weren't going to the point that we had. And other airlines had in place these profit-sharing programs, and we did not. And it felt to our team like we -- well, they understood, again, the logic -- felt as though we weren't appreciating their contribution to the bottom line, which is the last thing we were trying to accomplish. So what we realized is, if we were going to really get our team engaged and excited, which is an imperative to accomplishing all we want to accomplish and all the things Scott talked about that we're working on, to get -- or to compete against the other airlines, and particularly for premium travelers, we have to have our team engaged and excited, and this was holding us back. So I firmly believe it's in our shareholders' best interest to do it. We wouldn't have done it otherwise. We have indeed seen an uplift in engagement and excitement because of this. Not so much, I don't think, because of the actual dollars involved, just because it proved what our employees wanted to believe, that indeed, it is different. And that we will listen. And that we will do things even though we've made -- even though we've taken strong positions, if it gets to the point that we think it's not working, we're willing to revisit those decisions. So all those things have had a positive impact on the team. I think that's good for -- I know it's good for our shareholders. It's impossible to quantify. And it's also early. The real challenge to the team is to not -- is to now build on it. This is temporary. While the profit sharing is -- will stay in place, the feeling of instituting profit sharing is not going to stay in place. It will become just, I imagine, over time, just part of everyone's compensation that they -- that -- in the way they view it. And our challenge is now to use it to go do the things that we want to go do as an airline and put in place the product with the people that do their job so well. And we want to. So just a long way of me saying, it wasn't an easy decision, but I know it's the right decision for our shareholders."

I think, actually",501,"Yes, we hit a -- I'll go back a little bit. We hit a little bit of a rough patch in February and March, where corporate demand, in particular, seemed a little weak, and I think a lot of airlines -- well, every airline tended to see that. I think, actually, I think, there's 2 reasons for that as near as I can hypothesize, both of which have gotten better now, so that's the good news. The first one is, we had a stock market that dropped, whatever it dropped, 10% or 12% and, as we've said before, on a headline basis, whether it should or not, that does affect travel demand, particularly corporate travel demand, which it's easy to go when you start to get worried, rein in your travel and entertainment budget. 
And so I do think that was one of the factors, it appears that the market has come back. That close-in booking demand has gotten stronger. 
Another thing that happened, which got talked about a little bit on our earnings call the last time, I got asked a question about Advantage fares, which I know many people on this call think -- or were worried was problematic, and I declined to answer it on the last call. The reason I declined to answer it is because there were no Advantage fares on the market at the time. None of the airlines had Advantage fares. They'd all been canceled. And so I didn't want to talk about it. 
We went for about 3 months with no Advantage fares in the market. That 3-month period actually coincided with the relative decline in revenue expectations across mostly all airlines. So we were starting to wonder if our decision to cancel Advantage fares was really the correct revenue decision. But before we had made a final decision on that, one of our competitors, I presumably concluded, that it was also the wrong decision and put them back. So they've been back in the market now for a couple of weeks. And the combination of those 2 things means that in the last couple of weeks, we've actually seen strengthening close-in demand, not just absolute demand, but booked revenue. So we actually feel better about the revenue environment than we would have, say, 3 to 4 weeks ago. 
On the domestic front, I know that some have talked advanced book yields being up. That's true for us, too. Our booked yields domestically for May, June, July and August are up year-over-year for all of those months. But I don't want to mislead anyone because that's been true for the past several months. The issue has not really been about advanced book yields. We've had advanced book yields domestically up. It's been about weak close-in yields. And there still is weakness in close-in yields, although we do have a pretty strong demand environment. And bookings are up a lot year-over-year, but the yield is tending to fall as we get closer to departure."

I don't really care how we got here, but the fares that I'm being asked to pay, particularly close-in, and to your point, they strike me as stupidly low.

Is it the junk fares have been popping up in markets where discounters don't even exist? Is it something about minimum stay requirements? I mean, the reason I ask is not in regards to what you might do differently, it's what we might be looking for, keeping an eye out for in terms of change as opposed to just monitoring for plain vanilla fare increases?"

But the fare environment has changed over the last couple of decades. One of the big -- probably, I think the biggest change has been the lack of pricing fences. So historically, airli",541,"Well, I won't use the term wrong because of the connotations that has. But the fare environment has changed over the last couple of decades. One of the big -- probably, I think the biggest change has been the lack of pricing fences. So historically, airlines had a 14-day advance purchases with Saturday night stays, and that was an effective way to segment demand and offer business travelers great product, high-frequency, the availability to book last minute, but also to be able to offer leisure fares that could fill the empty seats on airplanes that were below the average cost of flying the airplanes, but could fill what would have otherwise been empty seats, and it would effectively have segmented demand. Really, because of the growth of low-cost carriers, those pricing fences have broken down across-the-board, and you have lots of 0 AP [ph] fares, lots of one-way fares and more than anything, that's what, I think, has driven lower fares for business travel and for close-in traffic. 
Now the ways to combat that are -- and to drive higher fares, basic and premium economy are 2 of the really, I think, big levers for American Airlines in doing that. We're not going to have that really in place until next year. But today, when we -- we wind up having to be competitive with others, and so we have low fares in the market that have very few restrictions on them, and there's no reason for a customer to pay more. And we're going to -- you get the exact same product, whether you buy a $41 walk-up fare or a $900 walk-up fare. And we're going to change that. And we're going to have different products. And the more you're paying, the better benefits you're going to get. That's one of the really big things that we can do. Part of that -- part and parcel of that is investing in the products and having a great product that customers are actually willing to pay for and pay more for. So that for those customers who aren't commodity customers, we have a lot of our customers who are commoditized. But for those customers who are not commoditized, we can sell them a better product and be appropriately compensated for that. 
You also see changes going on in the industry like this stuff about fare combinability which, for the most part, has been rolled back now. But those are -- the fare combinability is an artifact of history that goes back to the 1960s when GDSs were first built and has had unintended consequences as the pricing environment changed. So the fact that those kinds of changes are happening, even if they happen in fitful ""one step forward, two steps back"" kind of process are actually long-term encouraging to me because we're moving to a world where we're getting away from just commoditizing the price of the product and getting to we will sell a commoditized product for some customers, but for other customers, we will be able to decommoditize the product, and that's not going to happen overnight. That's not going to happen this year, but we're on a good path to get there. And that's a structural change."

We always try to give you guys the best 50-50 forecast that we can on our outlook for capacity growth. And in a world where we continue to see PRASM declines, even though our earnings have been growing for many quarters in a row, in a world of negative PRASM, we view that as indicative of supply and demand being misbalanced. And so as a result, we've cut capacity historically. 
Turning to those other items, they're really hard to quantify. A credit card deal, I'm not going to try to quantify. You can look to what other deals have done and make your own guess as to what the American Airlines deal will be. The American Airlines loyalty program and our partnerships with Citi and Barclays, we have the largest and best loyalty program in the world, and we're very proud of that. And we have 2 great partners today, and we're looking forward to making that even better for American Airlines, for our customers and for our bank partners. 
On the other items, some of those things are longer-term, like basic economy, premium economy. Those are really 2017 initiatives for next year, again, hard to quantify. In the yield management area, those are the -- that's the kind of thing that when we'll ultimately get everything completed that we're working on. It's probably -- we don't -- it's, again, impossible to know for sure but probably worth 2 to 3 points of PRASM, at least I think it should be worth 2 to 3 points of PRASM. But it's also hard to know when you will finish that. Yes, you put a new yield management system in place. You're replacing something that's been there for 25 years. You're going to get to a better position in the end, but all the patches and things that have been built into the system for the past 25 years to fix this problem or that problem or this place that didn't work worked well -- you rip off all those Band-Aids, and so you do take a few steps back sometimes before you can really get the system tuned and running. And that's, frankly, a continuous process. It never finishes. But we're right in the middle of starting a conversion process, so it's probably more challenging for us in the short term than it would be in a normal state of time. But I think, improvements to yield management, ultimately, should be worth 2 to 3 points for us."

But look, if I was an investor who had a short-term horizon on trading, I would care about what next -- what tomorrow's revenues look like. And that's a lot of who you have to deal with, and those are our shareholders we care about them as well. But our job is to maximize long-term shareholder value, and that doesn't mean at all that we ignore the near term, and I'm not -- none of us would suggest that we are. But this is what I tried to say in my comments. Just because we're bullish about the future don't take that to mean that we're entirely pleased with the current environment because we're not. We just -- I just -- we just happen to believe that the long-term prospects for the stock don't -- are not reflected in the current price. And maybe that's because there's too much focus on the near term or maybe it's just because we're wrong. I don't know. So look, that's for you all to decide. Our job is to run the airline for the long term. We are very excited about the long term. We are not pleased with the current term. Again, I shouldn't say we're not pleased. We're actually making $1.2 billion in the quarter is not something we're unhappy about. But our value -- or our job is to maximize shareholder value, and we know there are things that we -- that can be done better. And particularly, as Scott has noted, on the revenue environment, we think there are brighter days ahead, but we're not pleased with where we are now. It's not where we expected to be at this point. None of us were looking out a year ago and thinking we'd see these kinds of revenue declines. But I'm also happy to report that if we -- if someone were to have projected these kinds of revenue declines, I don't think they would have projected $1.2 billion in earnings. So I don't know. It's a long answer, and I'm not sure I can tell you why you what you think, Hunter. But what I -- I can tell you what we think, and what we think is the near term is really important but so is the long term. And it seems at times that we focus -- that you all have to focus more on the near term than we do. And so I don't think that's inconsistent. I don't think that's a disconnect. I just think it's a different perspective of time horizon."

So this industry, Scott, has a track record of making really good transformational changes when things are really painful and bad. So I'm wondering why we're using a pricing system that dates back to the '80s based on algorithms that might not even apply anymore when the industry structure has completely overhauled. So is it time to start thinking transformational stuff here in terms of how you price your ticket? Maybe it's a 5-year initiative, I don't know.

I think we are doing things that maybe they're not big enough to be called transformational but they're certainly evolutionary. Things like basic economy, premium economy, I'll put in the transformational bucket. Even things like getting rid of fare -- changing fare combinability and trying to get a better pricing structure through eliminating fare combinability -- has the potential to be transformational. We're stuck to some degree with -- we still sell a huge percentage of our tickets through GDSs and through even our own reservation systems, systems that were built and architected in the 1960s. And this fare combinability is one of those things. It's just built into the hardwiring of the system. And when we eliminate it for good reason, we create some unintended consequences with things like multicity ticketing and others. We're all -- we're running hard, we're not the only one. Other airlines, too, are running hard to change the way we price and to be able to do things to, in particular, I think, decommoditize the product and change the way airline pricing has worked historically. But we're working with these old mainframe systems, and it takes us time to get that done. It's not just us, it takes our partners' time, it takes SABRE time, it takes AmEx GlobalTravel time, all the changes because we're working in these old systems. And it's frustrating to us that we can't get these things done quicker because of great ideas about how to sell the product more effectively, about how to be able to, at the same airplane, compete with Spirit Airlines and at the same time, sell tickets to our premium customers who want a better product than they could ever possibly get on an airline like Spirit.

Look, you go back and look over the past really going all the way back to, I think, before the financial crisis and you've seen oil prices go up, you've seen fares go up with a lag, with a 3- to 6-month lag. A lot of times that lag, I mean, I think part of that is that you wind up with less capacity, which is completely rational. You wind up with less capacity when oil prices go up and that leads to a move in the supply curve, which leads to higher prices. I was disappointed when oil prices fell, but that link went the other direction as well, it did. And when oil prices fell, supply went up and fares went down. I think that, that is going to be in place going forward. And kind of going back to the earlier question, I think, the investor focus and worry about PRASM is appropriate, but essentially it is a worry that, that link won't exist. It's easy to say oil prices -- earnings are good right now, but what if oil prices go up and revenues don't go up along with it? And I think, that's really, I would characterize investor worry about PRASM. And I think it's one of the important points for investing in airlines. If you believe that, it's a pretty easy investment. If you don't believe that, it's a harder investment. I happen to believe it. We all here believe it pretty strongly. I mean, it's only a glimmer, but even if you look at this quarter, oil prices have gone up. They're still at really low levels. But as they've gone up across this quarter, essentially every airline that I've read the transcript for, so far, it's something they talk about reducing capacity. Those 2 things, I think, are correlated. And if it's rational, and so I think that we will see that link. And if oil prices go up, that revenues will go up as well. And I think that's sort of key to the investment thesis if you're an airline investor. If you believe that, it's a pretty easy story to say yes.

We're here to be the most profitable and the best."" So if indeed that's the case, that we were unprofitable and when we -- and we therefore reduced service to a market, and it was later replaced by someone else, that's what's supposed to happen. We couldn't be profitable there. And someone else wants to give it a shot. That's what competition is.

It's unusual to look at that. If there's one place that's become an exception to that, that we continue to reduce capacity here, it's been in South America, where we could see this disaster, catastrophic numbers coming and started to get ahead or tried to get ahead of the curve on reducing capacity pretty significantly. And saw a lot of competitors continue to grow double digits. Now the good news is that appears to have stopped. It's gotten bad enough in Brazil, in particular, that everyone is deciding to shrink. But I was frankly surprised at the competitive reaction in a place where you're having RASM decline to 40% 2 years in a row to see that.

I guess, I just wonder how you sort of apply that logic to today, right? Because I mean, if we just were to think about, for instance, the domestic environment, in the second quarter, you saw about a 6.5% revenue decline domestically, and I appreciate that DPIJ is probably playing a role. But maybe you still have a mid-single-digit decline in your unit revenue in Q1. And that's on an industry capacity growth number that's adjusted for leap year and the domestic market of about 5%. And so if I to go back and look historically, domestic airline revenue has grown at something like U.S. nominal GDP. So if you have kind of a low to single digit -- low to mid-single-digit underlying revenue trend as a result of just general economic activity and you couple that with a 5% supply growth number, then I guess I would have expected something more like a low single-digit kind of RASM decline as opposed to a mid-single-digit RASM decline. So just, I guess, sorry for the long-winded question, but the -- I think, the worry here isn't so much that capacity decisions have decoupled from fuel. It's more that pricing seems to have decoupled from what's going on with capacity, and I think, we're all just struggling to understand that."

The first quarter, sort of, I guess, across the industry domestically was weaker than, I think, you would have thought fundamentals would suggest. For us, RASM -- consolidated domestic RASM was down 5.3%. I think you referred to the mainline number. But a 5% PRASM decline, even a couple of points of that is coming from DPIJ. I thought it was better. I really do think -- I think it was the first question on the call. I'd go back to, I think, there were 2 big things that caused the first quarter to be worse than it otherwise would have been. One was the temporary change in the pricing structure where Advantage Fares were gone and now they're back. And second was we had a drop in corporate travel demand mid-quarter that coincided with the decline in the stock market. And we've seen that happened before, and it comes back. That's the bad news. The good news is as we've moved into April, close-in demand -- as those 2 things have changed, close-in demand actually has picked up pretty well.

At the time, what we were talking about was a real concern among -- on people's part that indeed you might see declines in 2016 versus 2015, and at least articulated by some as a concern that we had peaked as an industry. And what I was trying to point out at that time was that's not -- that wasn't our view. Indeed, what I said -- what we believed and what I said, I'm pretty sure, was 2015 had this phenomenon of incredibly quickly falling fuel prices that fell so fast, that capacity couldn't catch it. And in a sense, the 2015 results, because of that, were higher than one would expect them to be in the long term. So while you might see, therefore, declines into 2016 and margins, you shouldn't view that as the industry had peaked rather you should view that as kind of a 1 term, onetime spike in margins in the industry and that they would normalize in '16 to a level higher than '14 which, by the way, it appears they're going to. And therefore, one shouldn't assume that they would continue to fall from '16 into '17. So I think all that's still true, but I'm not going to try and make a forecast on '17 for you because I don't know. But that's what I was trying to point out that 2015 -- the fact that 2016 was going to be lower than 2015, which it's turned out to be, I certainly wouldn't view as some sort of cyclical issue as opposed to rather than this kind of spike that we had in '15."

The rationale being that an inferior product from a customer's perspective. A customer would rather fly nonstop. And so offering a lower price, that's something that US Airways uniquely did. We brought that to American Airlines after the merger. And when we did that, our large competitors copied us. So now it is -- you called it a generic thing, but it is really systematic and exists virtually everywhere that there's nonstop service in the U.S."

As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts in capacity, traffic and load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected.
Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at aa.com.
A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

168569,330447003,962391,"American Airlines Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","American Airlines Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items, of $1.2 billion. That is slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 2",676,"Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. This morning we announced 2016 pretax earnings for the first quarter, excluding special items, of $1.2 billion. That is slightly down from our all-time record first quarter earnings that were set in 2015. But of more relevance to our shareholders, on an adjusted earnings per share basis, EPS actually grew 15% versus last year's record. That, of course, is because our share count is lower due to the share repurchase program we've had in place.
And indeed, absolute earnings would have been slightly higher than last year's record, instead of slightly lower, except for the company's unilateral decision to institute a profit-sharing program for our employees beginning in 2016. I know investors may question that decision. It's a big decision. And the fact of the matter is we, at American, had attempted to transform our industry's compensation structure consistent with our view that our industry had been transformed. 
In short, we believe the best way, as most industries do, to pay our hardworking team is to give them an industry-leading base wage instead of lower wages, and then give them a share of the profits at the end of the year. But as it became more clear over time that our competitors were not going to do the same, it became a real issue for our team and, therefore, for our shareholders. And while the team understood the logic, we just couldn't get past a collective view amongst the team that the company didn't appreciate their contributions to the success of the team, and that certainly wasn't the intent, nor the view. So we implemented a unilateral 5% profit-sharing program. The first accrual of which is in these results. There's -- the accrual was $73 million for our team. We're quite pleased with that and believe you, as shareholders, should be as well. The fact of the matter is the announcement had the impact that we had hoped. Our team is excited. They're engaged. They are intent upon returning American to be the greatest airline in the world, and we're seeing it in the results. You can see it in the great job our team is doing of running our airline, taking care of our customers. So I will begin by thanking them for their continued hard work and everything they're doing to return American to greatness and take care of our customers. 
As for the share repurchase, we returned more than $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, and our board has authorized a new $2 billion repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. 
Now look, we're purchasing our shares because we're bullish on the stock and our prospects at American. We think it's a great investment for a couple reasons: One, we continue to believe that the market does not seem to fully appreciate the transformation that's taken place in this industry. And as a result, we believe the industry is well undervalued. 
Second, we think American Airlines has more upside than anyone else in the industry. We're not done with the integration. We have -- we are making investments at a rate that no other airline has done in the past in the product and in our people, which will turn into our product. And that gives us upside that others don't have. So we're very bullish. 
But look, because we're bullish, that doesn't mean we are totally pleased with the current performance because we're not. In particular, we're disappointed in our revenue performance, on both an absolute level and relative to some of our peers. And Scott will take some time to explain the current situation and the outlook, but just know that we don't view the current revenue trends as either acceptable or long-term. If we did, we wouldn't be as bullish as we are. So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek to give you a lot more details, and then Scott will give you some color, and then we'll take questions. Derek?"

In our 10-Q and earnings press release filed this morning, we reported our first quarter 2016 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share. This compares to 2015 net profit, excluding net special charges, of $1.2 billion or $0.0173 (sic) [ $1.73 ] per diluted share. 
As we talked about on our last call, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company concluded that realization of substantially all of the deferred tax assets, principally net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs, was more likely than that. This was the basis for the company's strong financial performance since the merger and expectations of financial substained (sic) [sustained] future profitability. Accordingly, the company reversed the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2015. Starting with its first quarter of 2016 results, the company will be recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. 
For 2016, quarterly net profit will not be comparable to net profit of 2015. As a result, we believe pretax profit, excluding net special items, is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance and net income. 
On that basis, our first quarter pretax profit, excluding net special charges, was $1.22 billion, which resulted in record first quarter pretax margin of 12.9%. This compares to our 2015 first quarter pretax profit, excluding net special charges, of $1.25 billion and a pretax margin of 12.7%. 
As Doug talked about, excluding the effects of our special items and the noncash tax provision, our first quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was up 15% to $1.99 per share, reflecting a 15% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the first quarter of 2016 was 65.1 billion ASMs, up 3.6% from the same period in 2015 with mainline capacity up 3.1% and regional capacity was up 8.1%. We continue to make significant investment in our fleet renewal program, which has given the company the youngest and most modern fleet of the U.S. network airlines. By the end of this year, we expect the average age of our mainline fleet to fall below 10 years, well below any of our network competitors. In the first quarter of 2016, the company took delivery of 15 new mainline aircraft while retiring 19 mainline aircraft. The company also added 13 regional aircraft and removed 3 regional aircraft. This program will continue throughout the year when we expect to take delivery of 55 new mainline aircraft, while adding that 49 regional aircraft. And to keep our capacity in check, we expect to remove 86 mainline aircraft and 23 regional aircraft from our fleet during the year.
Our first quarter 2016 revenue continued to be negatively impacted by competitive capacity increases, principally in certain domestic markets, economic softness in Latin America and the impact of a stronger dollar in foreign markets. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $9.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $8.1 billion, down 4.2%, driven by 7.1% lower yields on a 3.6% increase in system capacity. 
Cargo revenues were down 16.8% to $162 million due primarily to a 15.3% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were relatively flat at $1.2 billion. 
Total RASM in the first quarter of 2016 was $0.145, down 7.3%, driven principally by a decline in passenger RASM of 7.5%, which Scott will talk about in a minute. 
As Doug mentioned in his remarks, on March 23, we introduced an employee profit-sharing program, which will pay out 5% of pretax profit, excluding special items, starting with our full year 2016 results. This program was retroactive to January 1 and accordingly, we recognized $73 million of profit sharing expense in the first quarter. The company also accelerated a contractual marked-to-market pay rate adjustment for the company's flight attendants and reached agreement with our dispatchers on a new contract in April. Costs associated with these rate adjustments and the profit-sharing program will be included in our forward CASM guidance that I'll discuss later.
Our first quarter financial results continue to reflect the significant savings from the year-over-year decline in jet fuel prices. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the first quarter of 2016, was down 34.1% to $1.20 per gallon. Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.1 billion, down 5.9% versus the same period last year due primarily to $607 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Operating expenses, excluding net special charges for the first quarter of 2016, were $8 billion, down 3.7% year-over-year. 
First quarter mainline CASM per -- cost per ASM, excluding net special charges, was $0.1141, down 6.9% year-over-year due primarily to lower fuel costs. Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0962 in the first quarter, up 1.4% year-over-year. This increase was due primarily to contractual labor rate increases, including for our customer service and res agents and the introduction of our profit-sharing plan. These rate increases were offset in part by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses.
Regional operating cost per ASM, excluding special items and fuel, was $0.1611 for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 2.2%, and our consolidated first quarter CASM was up 1%. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $9.4 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.9 billion and a $2.4 billion undrawn revolver capacity. 
The company also had $691 million classified in restricted cash. During the first quarter of 2016, we generated $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations and paid $310 million in scheduled debt payments. As a reminder, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we provided our view on leverage and liquidity for American going forward. And particularly, we stated that in today's earnings and interest rate environment, liquidity was the most important metric we consider. And given our relative leverage, we expect to maintain a liquidity level of at least $6.5 billion. We also provided guidance with respect to where we are with our fleet rental program, access to attractive debt in the capital markets, ongoing share repurchase programs and our belief that American will produce sustained earnings. Our liquidity of $9.4 billion for the quarter end was up 8 -- up from $8.7 billion at the end of 2015 and was well in excess of the $6.5 billion liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. 
As previously mentioned, we believe it's important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage in that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
With respect to leverage, we look to metrics, such as net debt-to-EBITDAR, and with our planned aircraft financing this year, we continue to expect that on this metric, we will peak in 2016 and then begin to see this decline each year going forward as our capital spending declines. 
In early January, the company issued $1.1 billion in enhanced equipment trust certificates at a blended rate just below 4%. The proceeds for this financing were used to finance aircraft previously delivered in 2015. The company also raised approximately $4 billion -- or $400 million in other low-cost aircraft financing during the quarter. 
For the first quarter, the company returned more than $1.6 billion to its shareholders through the repayment of $61 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.56 billion of common stock or 39.3 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $6.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $6.1 billion and dividends of $0.5 billion. 
Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and shares distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 23% from 756.1 million at merger close to 585.7 million shares on March 31, 2016. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $850 million remaining on its current authorization and as a result, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will expire at the end of 2017. On a program-to-date basis, the company's Board of Directors has authorized a total of $9 billion of share repurchases.
Turning now to our 2016 guidance, we continue to value our capacity and in our IR update, issued 2 weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2.5%. Full year domestic capacity growth is expected to be up approximately 2.5% and international has been reduced from 6% down to 2.5%. By quarter, the first quarter is $62.6 billion -- or second quarter, $62.6 billion, excuse me, $64.8 billion in the third, $58.9 million in the fourth. On a regional breakdown, it's $8.01 billion in the second, $8.22 billion in the third and $8.08 billion in the fourth.
On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, to be up approximately 3% to 5% with the regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. Mainline CASM in the first and second quarter will be up between 4% and 6% and in the fourth quarter, up 3% to 5%. Regional CASM will be down by approximately 4% to 6% in the second quarter and down 3% to 5% in both the third and fourth quarter.
Based on the overall fuel curve of April 18, 2016, we expect to see another year of significant year-over-year fuel savings. In the second quarter, we expect $1.30 to $1.35; third quarter, $1.36 to $1.41; fourth quarter, $1.40 to $1.45. 
On the regional side, the second quarter, we have $1.35 to $1.40; third quarter $1.43 to $1.48; and the fourth quarter, $1.47 to $1.52. And based on these prices, we expect our 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year.
Using the midpoints of guidance we provided along with the PRASM guidance that Scott will give, we expect our second quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 16%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion will occur in the second quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect to invest $1.2 billion for nonaircraft CapEx, which includes investment to improve our product and the operations.
So in conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, we have strong first quarter results, which make an excellent start to 2016. While we still have a lot of work to do to complete our integration and our continued financial success has us well-positioned for the years ahead. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Scott."

And I'd like to start by thanking our operations team and the 100,000 people of American Airlines that continue to make great strides. And in fact, the first quarter was our best operational quarter since the merger closed. Despite the fact",1025,"Thanks, Derek. And I'd like to start by thanking our operations team and the 100,000 people of American Airlines that continue to make great strides. And in fact, the first quarter was our best operational quarter since the merger closed. Despite the fact that we're years behind our competitors and starting the merger integration process, we've already gotten to the point where we're neck-and-neck for first place in departures and 0s, which we view as a primary metric for core operating reliability. And our other operating metrics are showing improvement as well with mishandled baggage rates down over 20% year-over-year and significant improvements in completion factor. 
But we know we can do even better. We have many initiatives and technology projects underway to further improve all of our operating metrics and are well on the path to operating the best airline in the world.
On the revenue front, the first quarter continued the challenging revenue environment with PRASM down 7.5%. Domestically, our consolidated PRASM was down 5.3%. We saw the strongest performance year-over-year in Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago. The weakest performance, once again, was in Miami, although that's still really a function of declining connecting revenues from South America. 
Internationally, the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges made up 1.7 points of total system PRASM decline. So that is a smaller impact than we saw in fourth quarter as we're beginning to overlap the dollar appreciation from last year. 
The Atlantic was our best-performing international region with PRASM down 2.1%. While we're relatively pleased with that result, we expect capacity growth across the Atlantic this summer to drive some incremental pressure in this region. 
Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 16% on 29% ASM growth, with continued weakness in both Japan and China but positive year-over-year PRASM in South Korea. 
Latin PRASM was down 17%, but as it's been for a while now, that weakness is concentrated in Brazil and Venezuela, where PRASM was down 39% and 48%, respectively. 
Looking forward, while the comps get easier in 2Q, the revenue environment remains challenging. We expect the revenue environment to remain challenging throughout 2016, but longer term, we feel quite positive about all the initiatives we have in place to drive higher revenues, including basic and premium economy, a new revenue base frequent flyer program, $3 billion in new product investments, our continued fleet modernization program and the best people in the industry who are focused on delivering the best customer service. 
We also recognize that the market is rightly concerned about getting back to positive PRASM, and we're also focused on that as an explicit internal goal. I think that time line has unfortunately been pushed into next year, and some of the long-term initiatives I describe will make a big difference in that regard in 2017. But we'd also like to find ways to accelerate the positive PRASM trends into this year. Doing so will require a fair level of sequential improvement. But one of the areas that we're focused on in the near term, include implementing a new demand forecasting system in yield management. This initiative where we're all -- we'll know will ultimately produce much better results. But as we've implemented this, in the recent past, we've had some ""1 step forward, 2 steps back"" issues with the new system. 
We're cautiously optimistic that we're through some of the teething pains and, in fact, as we look out into the summer, our PRASM forecast for June and beyond looks much better than April and May. As most of you know, we're also in the middle of negotiations for a new credit card deal. While I won't predict on this call when or even if we'll ever get a deal done, all of our large competitors have done new deals in the past couple of years, and we expect a similar large tailwind for American Airlines when we do, ultimately, get a new deal done. 
Further, we also adjust capacity in a world where we see declining demand. American Airlines was the slowest-growing airline in the United States last year, and as you've seen for several quarters in a row, we can continue to reduce our capacity plan in light of declining year-over-year PRASM. 
So while we believe the long-term outlook is bright and even have some near-term opportunities that could drive out performance, I know that many people on this call are a little more focused just on 2Q revenues. So for the second quarter, total scheduled capacity remains elevated in all regions. And while capacity growth rates were down slightly from the first quarter levels, total capacity is still growing faster than the economies in all regions of the world. 
As we move into the back half of the year, however, we still expect capacity growth rates to moderate further from the first-half level. 
As we experienced throughout 2015, we continue to see significant year-over-year competitive growth in Dallas, and we don't expect that to moderate until September. And while the comps get easier, the economy, currencies and revenue environment in Brazil and Venezuela both continue to deteriorate on a sequential basis. Given all this, we expect our system PRASM to decline 6% to 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. 
In conclusion, the near-term revenue environment remains challenging. While we're delivering solid bottom line results, we know that getting back to PRASM growth is important to our near- and long-term future. To do that, we are making smart investments in our product and continuing to modernize our fleet. We have an intense focus on improving our operations, and we're starting to see the results in our operating metrics. And we're investing in our people. Our team members are responsible for delivering great service to our customers each and every day. 
In the near term, we're focused on better day-to-day execution in revenue management and in getting our new yield management system properly tuned. When you put it all together, we feel very good about the foundation that we're building for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operation and drive higher revenues."

We're not in a world where we're saying, keep capacity in place, just taking a near-term perspective on cash flow or anything else. We are focused on getting to cash flow or PRASM-positive.

What I can tell you is this, we'd lost part of the team, and it's really important, particularly at this airline, given the future -- given the history that the team had gone through. And given what we're trying to accomplish to pull everyone together and help them understand that, indeed, it's different, much like we're trying to, with every one of our partners, help them understand that the world is different. What had happened is we'd lost a part of the team not because -- they understood analytically the argument we laid out, and that we've laid out for you and that we lay out all the time. And it certainly passed our, ""look them in the eye test"" which was important to us. We all talk about it with the team. We need to look our employees in the eye and tell them why we made the decisions, and we could do that extremely well. We just didn't like the look we were getting back on this one. I mean, the employees got it with their brains but they didn't get it in their hearts. And it really felt like -- again, largely because, while our other -- while our competitors kind of were moving in our direction, they weren't going to the point that we had. And other airlines had in place these profit-sharing programs, and we did not. And it felt to our team like we -- well, they understood, again, the logic -- felt as though we weren't appreciating their contribution to the bottom line, which is the last thing we were trying to accomplish. So what we realized is, if we were going to really get our team engaged and excited, which is an imperative to accomplishing all we want to accomplish and all the things Scott talked about that we're working on, to get -- or to compete against the other airlines, and particularly for premium travelers, we have to have our team engaged and excited, and this was holding us back. So I firmly believe it's in our shareholders' best interest to do it. We wouldn't have done it otherwise. We have indeed seen an uplift in engagement and excitement because of this. Not so much, I don't think, because of the actual dollars involved, just because it proved what our employees wanted to believe, that indeed, it is different. And that we will listen. And that we will do things even though we've made -- even though we've taken strong positions, if it gets to the point that we think it's not working, we're willing to revisit those decisions. So all those things have had a positive impact on the team. I think that's good for -- I know it's good for our shareholders. It's impossible to quantify. And it's also early. The real challenge to the team is to not -- is to now build on it. This is temporary. While the profit sharing is -- will stay in place, the feeling of instituting profit sharing is not going to stay in place. It will become just, I imagine, over time, just part of everyone's compensation that they -- that -- in the way they view it. And our challenge is now to use it to go do the things that we want to go do as an airline and put in place the product with the people that do their job so well. And we want to. So just a long way of me saying, it wasn't an easy decision, but I know it's the right decision for our shareholders."

We hit a little bit of a rough patch in February and March, where corporate demand, in particular, seemed a little weak, and I think a lot of airlines -- well, every airline tended to see that. I think, actually",501,"Yes, we hit a -- I'll go back a little bit. We hit a little bit of a rough patch in February and March, where corporate demand, in particular, seemed a little weak, and I think a lot of airlines -- well, every airline tended to see that. I think, actually, I think, there's 2 reasons for that as near as I can hypothesize, both of which have gotten better now, so that's the good news. The first one is, we had a stock market that dropped, whatever it dropped, 10% or 12% and, as we've said before, on a headline basis, whether it should or not, that does affect travel demand, particularly corporate travel demand, which it's easy to go when you start to get worried, rein in your travel and entertainment budget. 
And so I do think that was one of the factors, it appears that the market has come back. That close-in booking demand has gotten stronger. 
Another thing that happened, which got talked about a little bit on our earnings call the last time, I got asked a question about Advantage fares, which I know many people on this call think -- or were worried was problematic, and I declined to answer it on the last call. The reason I declined to answer it is because there were no Advantage fares on the market at the time. None of the airlines had Advantage fares. They'd all been canceled. And so I didn't want to talk about it. 
We went for about 3 months with no Advantage fares in the market. That 3-month period actually coincided with the relative decline in revenue expectations across mostly all airlines. So we were starting to wonder if our decision to cancel Advantage fares was really the correct revenue decision. But before we had made a final decision on that, one of our competitors, I presumably concluded, that it was also the wrong decision and put them back. So they've been back in the market now for a couple of weeks. And the combination of those 2 things means that in the last couple of weeks, we've actually seen strengthening close-in demand, not just absolute demand, but booked revenue. So we actually feel better about the revenue environment than we would have, say, 3 to 4 weeks ago. 
On the domestic front, I know that some have talked advanced book yields being up. That's true for us, too. Our booked yields domestically for May, June, July and August are up year-over-year for all of those months. But I don't want to mislead anyone because that's been true for the past several months. The issue has not really been about advanced book yields. We've had advanced book yields domestically up. It's been about weak close-in yields. And there still is weakness in close-in yields, although we do have a pretty strong demand environment.

I don't really care how we got here, but the fares that I'm being asked to pay, particularly close-in, and to your point, they strike me as stupidly low. Notwithstanding airlines recalcitrance to discuss pricing, what is potentially wrong with the structure? Is it multi-segment itineraries that are pricing too low? Is it the junk fares have been popping up in markets where discounters don't even exist? Is it something about minimum stay requirements? I mean, the reason I ask is not in regards to what you might do differently, it's what we might be looking for, keeping an eye out for in terms of change as opposed to just monitoring for plain vanilla fare increases?"

So historically, airli",541,"Well, I won't use the term wrong because of the connotations that has. But the fare environment has changed over the last couple of decades. One of the big -- probably, I think the biggest change has been the lack of pricing fences. So historically, airlines had a 14-day advance purchases with Saturday night stays, and that was an effective way to segment demand and offer business travelers great product, high-frequency, the availability to book last minute, but also to be able to offer leisure fares that could fill the empty seats on airplanes that were below the average cost of flying the airplanes, but could fill what would have otherwise been empty seats, and it would effectively have segmented demand. Really, because of the growth of low-cost carriers, those pricing fences have broken down across-the-board, and you have lots of 0 AP [ph] fares, lots of one-way fares and more than anything, that's what, I think, has driven lower fares for business travel and for close-in traffic. 
Now the ways to combat that are -- and to drive higher fares, basic and premium economy are 2 of the really, I think, big levers for American Airlines in doing that. We're not going to have that really in place until next year. But today, when we -- we wind up having to be competitive with others, and so we have low fares in the market that have very few restrictions on them, and there's no reason for a customer to pay more. And we're going to -- you get the exact same product, whether you buy a $41 walk-up fare or a $900 walk-up fare. And we're going to change that. And we're going to have different products. And the more you're paying, the better benefits you're going to get. That's one of the really big things that we can do. Part of that -- part and parcel of that is investing in the products and having a great product that customers are actually willing to pay for and pay more for. So that for those customers who aren't commodity customers, we have a lot of our customers who are commoditized. But for those customers who are not commoditized, we can sell them a better product and be appropriately compensated for that. 
You also see changes going on in the industry like this stuff about fare combinability which, for the most part, has been rolled back now. But those are -- the fare combinability is an artifact of history that goes back to the 1960s when GDSs were first built and has had unintended consequences as the pricing environment changed. So the fact that those kinds of changes are happening, even if they happen in fitful ""one step forward, two steps back"" kind of process are actually long-term encouraging to me because we're moving to a world where we're getting away from just commoditizing the price of the product and getting to we will sell a commoditized product for some customers, but for other customers, we will be able to decommoditize the product, and that's not going to happen overnight. That's not going to happen this year, but we're on a good path to get there. And that's a structural change."

We always try to give you guys the best 50-50 forecast that we can on our outlook for capacity growth. And in a world where we continue to see PRASM declines, even though our earnings have been growing for many quarters in a row, in a world of negative PRASM, we view that as indicative of supply and demand being misbalanced. And so as a result, we've cut capacity historically. 
Turning to those other items, they're really hard to quantify. A credit card deal, I'm not going to try to quantify. You can look to what other deals have done and make your own guess as to what the American Airlines deal will be. The American Airlines loyalty program and our partnerships with Citi and Barclays, we have the largest and best loyalty program in the world, and we're very proud of that. And we have 2 great partners today, and we're looking forward to making that even better for American Airlines, for our customers and for our bank partners. 
On the other items, some of those things are longer-term, like basic economy, premium economy. Those are really 2017 initiatives for next year, again, hard to quantify. In the yield management area, those are the -- that's the kind of thing that when we'll ultimately get everything completed that we're working on. It's probably -- we don't -- it's, again, impossible to know for sure but probably worth 2 to 3 points of PRASM, at least I think it should be worth 2 to 3 points of PRASM. But it's also hard to know when you will finish that. Yes, you put a new yield management system in place. You're replacing something that's been there for 25 years. You're going to get to a better position in the end, but all the patches and things that have been built into the system for the past 25 years to fix this problem or that problem or this place that didn't work worked well -- you rip off all those Band-Aids, and so you do take a few steps back sometimes before you can really get the system tuned and running. And that's, frankly, a continuous process. It never finishes. But we're right in the middle of starting a conversion process, so it's probably more challenging for us in the short term than it would be in a normal state of time. But I think, improvements to yield management, ultimately, should be worth 2 to 3 points for us."

But our job is to maximize long-term shareholder value, and that doesn't mean at all that we ignore the near term, and I'm not -- none of us would suggest that we are.

We're actually making $1.2 billion in the quarter is not something we're unhappy about. But our value -- or our job is to maximize shareholder value, and we know there are things that we -- that can be done better. And particularly, as Scott has noted, on the revenue environment, we think there are brighter days ahead, but we're not pleased with where we are now. It's not where we expected to be at this point. None of us were looking out a year ago and thinking we'd see these kinds of revenue declines. But I'm also happy to report that if we -- if someone were to have projected these kinds of revenue declines, I don't think they would have projected $1.2 billion in earnings. So I don't know. It's a long answer, and I'm not sure I can tell you why you what you think, Hunter. But what I -- I can tell you what we think, and what we think is the near term is really important but so is the long term. And it seems at times that we focus -- that you all have to focus more on the near term than we do. And so I don't think that's inconsistent. I don't think that's a disconnect.

So is it time to start thinking transformational stuff here in terms of how you price your ticket? Maybe it's a 5-year initiative, I don't know.

I think we are doing things that maybe they're not big enough to be called transformational but they're certainly evolutionary. Things like basic economy, premium economy, I'll put in the transformational bucket. Even things like getting rid of fare -- changing fare combinability and trying to get a better pricing structure through eliminating fare combinability -- has the potential to be transformational. We're stuck to some degree with -- we still sell a huge percentage of our tickets through GDSs and through even our own reservation systems, systems that were built and architected in the 1960s. And this fare combinability is one of those things. It's just built into the hardwiring of the system. And when we eliminate it for good reason, we create some unintended consequences with things like multicity ticketing and others. We're all -- we're running hard, we're not the only one. Other airlines, too, are running hard to change the way we price and to be able to do things to, in particular, I think, decommoditize the product and change the way airline pricing has worked historically. But we're working with these old mainframe systems, and it takes us time to get that done. It's not just us, it takes our partners' time, it takes SABRE time, it takes AmEx GlobalTravel time, all the changes because we're working in these old systems. And it's frustrating to us that we can't get these things done quicker because of great ideas about how to sell the product more effectively, about how to be able to, at the same airplane, compete with Spirit Airlines and at the same time, sell tickets to our premium customers who want a better product than they could ever possibly get on an airline like Spirit.

Look, you go back and look over the past really going all the way back to, I think, before the financial crisis and you've seen oil prices go up, you've seen fares go up with a lag, with a 3- to 6-month lag. A lot of times that lag, I mean, I think part of that is that you wind up with less capacity, which is completely rational. You wind up with less capacity when oil prices go up and that leads to a move in the supply curve, which leads to higher prices. I was disappointed when oil prices fell, but that link went the other direction as well, it did. And when oil prices fell, supply went up and fares went down. I think that, that is going to be in place going forward. And kind of going back to the earlier question, I think, the investor focus and worry about PRASM is appropriate, but essentially it is a worry that, that link won't exist. It's easy to say oil prices -- earnings are good right now, but what if oil prices go up and revenues don't go up along with it? And I think, that's really, I would characterize investor worry about PRASM. And I think it's one of the important points for investing in airlines. If you believe that, it's a pretty easy investment. If you don't believe that, it's a harder investment. I happen to believe it. We all here believe it pretty strongly. I mean, it's only a glimmer, but even if you look at this quarter, oil prices have gone up. They're still at really low levels. But as they've gone up across this quarter, essentially every airline that I've read the transcript for, so far, it's something they talk about reducing capacity. Those 2 things, I think, are correlated. And if it's rational, and so I think that we will see that link. And if oil prices go up, that revenues will go up as well. And I think that's sort of key to the investment thesis if you're an airline investor. If you believe that, it's a pretty easy story to say yes. And if you don't believe that, I get the focus on near-term PRASM and worry about near-term PRASM."

We're here to be the most profitable and the best."" So if indeed that's the case, that we were unprofitable and when we -- and we therefore reduced service to a market, and it was later replaced by someone else, that's what's supposed to happen. We couldn't be profitable there. And someone else wants to give it a shot. That's what competition is.

It's unusual to look at that. If there's one place that's become an exception to that, that we continue to reduce capacity here, it's been in South America, where we could see this disaster, catastrophic numbers coming and started to get ahead or tried to get ahead of the curve on reducing capacity pretty significantly. And saw a lot of competitors continue to grow double digits. Now the good news is that appears to have stopped. It's gotten bad enough in Brazil, in particular, that everyone is deciding to shrink. But I was frankly surprised at the competitive reaction in a place where you're having RASM decline to 40% 2 years in a row to see that. But almost everywhere else, we look at the world and just say, here's -- whatever is best for American Airlines is going to be the same no matter what the competitive response is."

I guess, I just wonder how you sort of apply that logic to today, right? Because I mean, if we just were to think about, for instance, the domestic environment, in the second quarter, you saw about a 6.5% revenue decline domestically, and I appreciate that DPIJ is probably playing a role. But maybe you still have a mid-single-digit decline in your unit revenue in Q1. And that's on an industry capacity growth number that's adjusted for leap year and the domestic market of about 5%. And so if I to go back and look historically, domestic airline revenue has grown at something like U.S. nominal GDP. So if you have kind of a low to single digit -- low to mid-single-digit underlying revenue trend as a result of just general economic activity and you couple that with a 5% supply growth number, then I guess I would have expected something more like a low single-digit kind of RASM decline as opposed to a mid-single-digit RASM decline. So just, I guess, sorry for the long-winded question, but the -- I think, the worry here isn't so much that capacity decisions have decoupled from fuel. It's more that pricing seems to have decoupled from what's going on with capacity, and I think, we're all just struggling to understand that."

The first quarter, sort of, I guess, across the industry domestically was weaker than, I think, you would have thought fundamentals would suggest. For us, RASM -- consolidated domestic RASM was down 5.3%. I think you referred to the mainline number. But a 5% PRASM decline, even a couple of points of that is coming from DPIJ. I thought it was better. I really do think -- I think it was the first question on the call. I'd go back to, I think, there were 2 big things that caused the first quarter to be worse than it otherwise would have been. One was the temporary change in the pricing structure where Advantage Fares were gone and now they're back. And second was we had a drop in corporate travel demand mid-quarter that coincided with the decline in the stock market. And we've seen that happened before, and it comes back. That's the bad news. The good news is as we've moved into April, close-in demand -- as those 2 things have changed, close-in demand actually has picked up pretty well.

At the time, what we were talking about was a real concern among -- on people's part that indeed you might see declines in 2016 versus 2015, and at least articulated by some as a concern that we had peaked as an industry. And what I was trying to point out at that time was that's not -- that wasn't our view. Indeed, what I said -- what we believed and what I said, I'm pretty sure, was 2015 had this phenomenon of incredibly quickly falling fuel prices that fell so fast, that capacity couldn't catch it. And in a sense, the 2015 results, because of that, were higher than one would expect them to be in the long term. So while you might see, therefore, declines into 2016 and margins, you shouldn't view that as the industry had peaked rather you should view that as kind of a 1 term, onetime spike in margins in the industry and that they would normalize in '16 to a level higher than '14 which, by the way, it appears they're going to. And therefore, one shouldn't assume that they would continue to fall from '16 into '17. So I think all that's still true, but I'm not going to try and make a forecast on '17 for you because I don't know. But that's what I was trying to point out that 2015 -- the fact that 2016 was going to be lower than 2015, which it's turned out to be, I certainly wouldn't view as some sort of cyclical issue as opposed to rather than this kind of spike that we had in '15."

As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he'll provide an overview of our second quarter 2016 financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts' questions and, lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts in capacity, traffic and load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website.
A webcast of this call will also be archived on the website, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

As is our normal practice we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 gap net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to our 2015 gap net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.41 per diluted share. Excluding special charges, we reported a net profit of $1 billion or $1.77 per diluted share versus the second quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.9 billion or $2.62 per diluted share. As we talked about on our last 2 earnings calls, the company did reverse the allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As a result, in 2016, the company is recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly net profit in 2016 will not be comparable to net profit in 2015. Accordingly, we believe pretax profit and pretax profit excluding net special items is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance the net income. 
On that basis, our second quarter net tax or pretax profit was $1.5 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 14.4% on a GAAP basis. Excluding special charges, our pretax profit was $1.6 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 15.4%. And as Doug said, both of these measures are the second best,second quarter pretax margin in company history, 
Excluding the effect of special items and the noncash tax position of $541 million, our second quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.81 per share, up 7.3% as compared to second quarter 2015, reflecting a 20% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the second quarter of 2016 was 70.8 [ph] billion ASMs, up 1.9% from the second quarter with mainline up [ph] 1.2% and regional capacity up 8%. Our second quarter 2016 revenue is impacted by a competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.4 billion, down 4.3% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9 billion, down 4.4% driven by 5.3% yield -- lower yields. Cargo revenues were down 10.4% to $174 million due primarily to a 12.7% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, down 2.1% versus the same period last year. 
On July 12, we did announce a new credit card agreement with Barclays card U.S., Citi and MasterCard. This agreement extends and deepens American's relationship with its existing credit card providers and is expected to generate $200 million in pretax income, incremental pretax income in the second half of 2016. It's about $100 million each quarter; $550 million in 2017; and $800 million in 2018 with modest increases in later years of the agreement. Most of the increases will be reflected in other revenue. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 3.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to a $530 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the second quarter of 2016, was down 25.5% year-over-year to $1.41 per gallon. Second quarter mainline CASM was 11.32 [ph] cents, down 4.6% year-over-year due primarily due to the lower fuel costs. Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was 9.12 cents, up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to contractual labor rate increases for our customer service and red agents and the introduction of our profit-sharing plan. This rate increases were offset in part mainly by maintenance, timing and lower selling expenses. 
Regional operating cost per ASM in the second quarter was 18.78 cents, down 9.8% from 2015. Excluding special items and fuel, regional CASM has decreased by 4.6%. We ended the second quarter with approximately $9.5 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investment of $7.1 billion and $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had $460 [ph] million classified as restricted cash. This is a reduction of $51 million since the last quarter. And during the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations and paid $1.9 billion in debt. 
During the quarter, the company completed several efficient financing transactions, including the issuance of a new $1 billion 7-year term loan secured by the company's mainline spare parts and $844 million in JFK special facility bonds. In addition, the company issued $829 million, 2016-2 [ph] AA TC consisting of AA and A tranches, which was then augmented in early July with an additional $227 million B tranche, resulted in a total deal of $1.06 billion with a blended rate of 3.5%. 
In the second quarter, the company returned more than $1.7 billion to it shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $58 million and a repurchase of $1.7 billion of common stock or 50.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $8.4 through to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee pre-awards and share distributions and the cash [indiscernible]  of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 29% from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013, to 537.1 million shares on June 30, 2015. At the end of the second quarter, the company had approximately 1.2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
Our liquidity of $9.5 billion at the end of the second quarter was up slightly as compared to $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter and remains well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimum liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. As we discussed in our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels, higher than our network peers, given our overall leverage from the fact we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
In regard to our fleet renewal program, when we merged in 2013, both airlines had widebody fleet replacement plans that overlapped in 2017 and '18. As referenced in our earnings release, in order to spread out the wide-body replacement orders and our future aircraft CapEx requirements, we announced today that on July 18, we modified our purchase agreement with Airbus for 22 A350 XWB aircraft. Under this amended agreement, we will now receive our first A350 in late 2018. The deliveries are as follows: 2 in late '18 and 5 each from 2019 to 2022. This change reduces aircraft CapEx and PDPs by approximately $500 million in '17 and approximately $700 million in '18 and provides us with capacity flexibility. 
As we discussed in our last earnings call, in evaluating our leverage, we look at metrics such as net debt-to-EBITDAR as our fleet replacement program begins to normalize and with it, the deferral of our A350 aircraft deliveries. Going forward, our peak capital spending for aircraft will occur in 2016 and decline going forward. As we see today, we expect total net debt to follow the same path, peaking in 2016 and improving each year thereafter. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We continue to monitor our capacity plans, and in our IR update issued 2 weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by a half point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2%, both from domestic and international capacity, they'll both be up around 2%. So mainline capacity [indiscernible] $64.1 billion in the third and $58 billion in the fourth; and regional capacity, $8.19 billion in the third and $7.9 billion in the fourth. 
Year-over-year CASM excluding special items and fuel will be up approximately 4% to 6%, and regional capacity is expected to be up approximately -- or down, excuse me, approximately 3% to 5%. While fuel prices have risen since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect to see significant savings in year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curves as of yesterday, we expect to pay between $1.39 and $1.44 per gallon in 2016. In the third quarter, we expect $1.45 to $1.50; fourth quarter, $1.48 to $1.53. Regional, we expect third quarter $1.51 to $1.56; and in the fourth quarter, $1.54 to $1.59. Based on these prices, we expect 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Scott will give, we expect the third quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 12% and 14%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft to be approximately $4.4 billion in '16 with reader approximately $803 million occurring in the third quarter, and we still expect nonaircraft CapEx to be $1.2 billion for the year. 
In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, they again delivered strong quarterly results. While we still have a lot of work to do to fully complete our integration, we're excited about the commercial initiatives our team has implemented as well as those they're working on and look forward to reporting on our continued success in future calls. 
Thanks again for your time this morning, and I'll turn it over to Scott will talk about the revenue line."

Let's start but talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis for the first half of",683,"Thanks, Derek. Let's start but talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis for the first half of the year, all performance metrics improved for both mainline and regional operations, especially D-zero, which is up 3.3 points for mainline and 10.3 points for regional, and our mishandled bag rate which has been reduced by 24%. Of course, summer thunderstorms and high load factors bring incremental challenges for our team, but the people of American Airlines are continuing to do a great job taking care of our customers and improving the operation month in and month out. 
On the revenue front, 2Q PRASM came in at the high end of our forecast. And while it's still a challenging revenue environment, 2Q is better or less bad than 1Q, so we have at least started to see some second derivative improvement in PRASM. Domestically, concentrated PRASM was down 5%. We saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Phoenix, followed by DFW as our second best performing year-over-year hub. 
Internationally, as we're beginning to overlap the dollar strengthening last year, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges getting smaller and drove a 0.6% decline in PRASM. The Atlantic was once again our best-performing international region despite the high levels of capacity growth, with PRASM down 6%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 15% on 21% ASM growth with continued weakness in both Japan and China, but good PRASM results in Hong Kong and Korea. Latin PRASM was down 10%, but we saw a particular strength in Mexico and Argentina and on improving trend in Brazil. Looking forward, we expect the third quarter to continue showing modest second derivative improvement in year-over-year PRASM. Regionally, we expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. But domestically and in Latin America, we expect to continue the improvement relative to the second quarter, which will result in low-single-digits PRASM declines in both entities. We see particular strength in Mexico and it appears that capacity [indiscernible] are finally, starting to catch up in a declining demand in Brazil. Also, we will begin benefiting from the new credit card deals that most of that revenue will show up in other revenue. With that, we expect our total RASM -- not passenger, but also RASM to be down 3.5% to 5% year-over-year with about 1 point of that coming from the new credit card deal. And going forward, we plan to continue guiding to revenue -- to total RASM. 
While we don't really have enough bookings or data to have a forecast that's any more reliable than the analyst community, as we look to 4Q and beyond, we expect to see continued second derivative improvement in the year-over-year total RASM performance and we're looking forward to getting back to growing RASM. We're also excited with our plans to introduce basic economy towards the end of this year and premium economy at some point in 2017. We believe that product segmentation is a transformative change in how we segment the product to give all of our customers choice in what they prefer, whether it's more inclusive product bundle or just the bare bones, low price. Also, as Derek mentioned, we also lowered our capacity guidance for the back half of the year, which is really just a normal and natural reaction to a decline in year-over-year PRASM and higher fuel environment. 
In conclusion, we still dislike negative RASM, but we feel good about the path that we're on to get back to RASM growth. We continue making gradual improvements in our core results. Our new credit card deal will add significantly to revenues over the next few years, and we have big opportunities ahead of us with product segmentation. When you put it altogether, we feel very good about the foundation that we're building for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operation and drive higher revenues."

Actually, I would have said [indiscernible] things look marginally [indiscernible] for us on closing yields. But some of that is probably because we do, I think, have a little bit of a different competitive environment on a year-over-year basis. We've had some huge headwinds from a competitive perspective. Dallas Love Field is one of those big headwinds domestically that drove a lot of, like, capacity growth in our market. And now we're starting to overlap that, and so we have what would be a more normal comparison with the rest of the industry looking forward. And so that probably means that we are seeing something perhaps just a little different than our competitors in a year-over-year basis. Secondly, we've had, on a year-over-year basis, while still probably have the most exposure to ultra low-cost carriers of any airline, they aren't going in our markets anymore, at least to a large degree. And so we have less of that incremental pressure and they're adding capacity in other places. And when they do, that causes closing yields to decline in those markets. But we've already have that and we are overlapping now on a year-over-year basis, where they're effectively flat in our markets. And then third, we've been less involved in some of the pricing, I think, is the right word. Pricing issues going on between airlines. We've been involved in the periphery, but some others have been more involved in lowering fares in each of these markets that we have been. As we probably benefited from not being quite as involved in that."

I still think we'll get there, and I think we're on a good path. We took a step back from, well, a few big things that disproportionately impacted American these kind of things that are cyclical and elements come back. But if you look at Venezuela first, which had RASM that was 4 times our system average and country fell apart. And you had Brazil, which was 80-something percent above system average and the country fell apart. Those were massive, massive headwinds that drove 3 to 4 points. Just those 2 issues, 3 to 4 of points of system PRASM and 3 to 4 points of margin decline. So the hell we had to overcome to get back on those themes was bigger because those things, macro exogenous events disproportionately impacted American. That said, it feels like we are -- those things are about to be in the rearview mirror. Brazil is no longer a negative. Venezuela is still a big negative. It's still -- RASM is still going to be down 35% this coming quarter again, but it's coming off a much smaller base. And so now [indiscernible] people out of the system at one time, which is coming off a smaller base. So we had some really big headwinds between that Dallas Love Field growth. And those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror, and have a more normalized, at least on a year-over-year basis comparison to the rest of the industry. And I think, you are starting to already see our -- as we look out RASM results start to reflect that. We've also been at least 1 hand tied behind our backs in the last few years as you get through integration, you have all your resources, you have systems locked down and you didn't know you want to make changes, you can't because during the middle of converting the systems. And our hands are getting untied now, we still have some of that work left to do but there is more -- we don't have basic economy or premium economy, which I've said, I think, I'll be disappointed if they're not $1 billion a year. We have those done by now if we haven't been in the middle of an integration. But we have been in the middle of an integration and we've had to get through that. So I think we're going to continue to knock those kinds of  and many other smaller projects out along the way, and that we're on a good path we get our credit card deal done. Others get theirs done ahead of time, we get ours done. So I feel really good about the path that we're on and ultimately, our goal is to have the highest pretax margins amongst the network peers."

But listen, Scott, you avoided fuel hedging in the past, believing that fuel prices and passenger demand would broadly move in conjunction with one another. If you look at current revenue and GDP trends now, that time held relationship had decoupled for the first time since the financial crisis or the advent of the Internet. And, by the way, fuel and capacity have been volatile in the past, yet the revenue to GDP relationship was broadly unaffected. So I have 2 questions. First, what explains the disconnect? Is it secular or self-inflicted? And, two, if the relationship is decoupling and continues to do so, then your primary argument against fuel hedging is no longer valid. Thoughts?"

It does come with a lag, and I think, revenu",618,"Okay, so I'll try both of those. First, I think, there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with the lag. I've historically said 4 to 6 months, one of our competitors said 9 months. It does come with a lag, and I think, revenues will be higher in the fourth quarter than it otherwise would have been if fuel was lower. Now fuel prices, whatever it was yesterday, $47 a barrel, while it took a very brief spike down to $35 a barrel, I doubt capacity ever adjusted all the way down to $35 a barrel and you saw earnings improved dramatically as a result. So I am not sure what the right comparison is if it was $35 a barrel or $47 a barrel where people were planning capacity from, but I think there still is a link. Second is I think there has been another structural change in the industry. And that has been in particular the growth of ultra low-cost carriers. That structural change, a structural change that required a structural response. The structural response is twofold. It's, one, to compete with them, which we're doing. And the second one is product segmentation. It has been a structural change in the industry, where 20 years ago, we segmented customer demand based on fare rules. And if you are a business traveler, you're -- the higher the fares, the low fares, which were designed for leisure customers, required a Saturday night stay, you had to buy 21 days in advance and that didn't work for business travelers. That kind of segmentation doesn't work in today's world anymore, and so we have to change the model. And changing the model is going to product segmentation, which is what basic economy and premium economy are all about. Now I wish we could have done that by snapping our fingers like we could make a change in the fare filing and these ultra low-cost carriers grew that we could have immediately affected that change, but we couldn't. And so we had to compete first and then we'll get to segmentation starting with basic economy later this year and premium economy next year and, I think, that's going to address the secular change from ultra low-cost carriers. But we have  taken a lag down because of that and I think we'll recover it once we get those things in effect. As to the fuel hedging question, there's 2 reasons that hedged fuel and ex out I said the tied to revenues is maybe the second one. The biggest reason it's not hedged fuel is because it's rigged the game that's impossible to be. Fuel prices, most of the time, are trading at contango. So while fuel is $47 a barrel today, if we try to buy fuel for a year from now, it's well north of that. In addition, we all realize the risk that you take if you just do coccus caller. And so most people do, the prudent view is that you should buy the options. So if you want to buy option for a fuel a year from now, you're going to pay an $8 to $10 option premium. So fuel prices have to go up various times depending on how big the contango is and how high volatility is, but in the 30% to 50% range just to break even. And when you are playing a game that you have to have oil go up 30% to 50% to breakeven, it's impossible to win in the long-term. You can be days that you win or it could be months that you win, but it is impossible to win in the long-term."

So 2-plus years, depending on when they trigger Article 50. There is sort of, I think of it as 3 effects. One is the currency effect, which is a pretty clear negative. Actually, when we look at currency by currency, what has been the biggest year-over-year impact it's been the Brazilian real for a long time, it's now the U.K. pound because of a decline in currency. And by the way, we generated about 4% of our revenues are sold in British pounds. So currency decline is negative. The second point is that it will happen over the near to medium term, the indirect direct impact, I actually think will be positive. And when I say direct impact, I mean, the number of people having to fly back and forth across the North Atlantic, particularly business customers, as there's a lot more consultants, lawyers, bankers that are likely to be flying back and forth, figuring out what the heck this means what are we going to do. The third and most concerning thing that will be -- that has the potential to be negative is, in the near to medium term, is if it creates business confidence problems. We have seen historically, that when t here's business confidence, one of the first things businesses do is cut travel and entertainment budget. That's not something that would uniquely affect the U.K. or the EU, it will be a more broader impacts. I was gratified to see that while the market fall for 2 days after the Brexit vote, it has bounced back and that's usually a pretty good indicator of confidence or highly correlated with confidence. And so I think it's unlikely that we're going to see a big change of confidence. So all of which means, I think or the few years at least, there's going to be much impact from Brexit when you sort of do those 3 items. Don't have tons of data, we have a much worth of data so far and our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened, at least relative to where they were before. So hard to see any evidence that it's a big problem. Longer term, the issue is going to be obviously what happens with the U.K. economy, what happens with the banking industry in particular because that is a big component of revenue across the transatlantic, and what happens from a regulatory framework. But near term, I don't anticipate an awful lot of issues."

We do expect Europe to get worse, although it's really core in Europe more than it is the U.K. Europe has several almost, I guess, 3 strikes against it looking forward. It's, one, there is more economic uncertainty. If not just from Brexit, there's more economic uncertainty and it's a challenging economic environment in Europe so the macro is not good. You got accelerating capacity growth across the Atlantic, so it's a second strike for Europe. And third is currency. So the one impact of Brexit that actually is identifiable negative is currency weakness.

It's going to come down even more in the third and fourth quarter. And as a result, Brazil, which was running down kind of 35% in the second quarter RASM, was down 13%. In the third quarter, we expect it to be positive. Now we're getting a boost in the third quarter from the Olympics, so I wouldn't necessarily expect the fourth quarter to remain positive. Although our guess is right now that the fourth quarter will remain positive.

We are fully funded now higher than our competitors and will be funded at a rate higher than them when we do this, but we don't think -- none of us think it's in the best interest of the company to go fund it in advance or to be overfunded on something that doesn't have a return. So we'll keep doing until that, but we are well aware that it's not an issue whatsoever and it's fully manageable, it can be funded now."

Also in the room for our Q&A session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Bev Goulet, our Chief Information -- Integration Officer; and Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; as well as Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.
As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts' Q&A and, lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website.
A webcast of this call will be -- also will be archived on the website. And the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

168569,372896520,1010895,"American Airlines Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","American Airlines Group Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This co",1540,"All right. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to our 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.41 per diluted share. Excluding special charges, we reported a net profit of $1 billion or $1.77 per diluted share versus the second quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.9 billion or $2.62 per diluted share. 
As we talked about on our last 2 earnings calls, the company did reverse the val allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As a result, in 2016, the company is recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly net profit in 2016 will not be comparable to net profit in 2015. Accordingly, we believe pretax profit and pretax profit excluding net special items is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance than net income. 
On that basis, our second quarter net tax or pretax profit was $1.5 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 14.4% on a GAAP basis. Excluding special charges, our pretax profit was $1.6 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 15.4%. And as Doug said, both of these measures are the second best second quarter pretax margin in company history, 
Excluding the effect of special items and the noncash tax provision of $541 million, our second quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.81 per share, up 7.3% as compared to second quarter 2015, reflecting a 20% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the second quarter of 2016 was 70.8 billion ASMs, up 1.9% from the second quarter, with mainline up 1.2% and regional capacity up 8%. Our second quarter 2016 revenue was impacted by competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.4 billion, down 4.3% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9 billion, down 4.4% driven by 5.3% yield -- lower yields. Cargo revenues were down 10.4% to $174 million due primarily to a 12.7% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, down 2.1% versus the same period last year. 
On July 12, we did announce a new credit card agreement with Barclaycard US, Citi and MasterCard. This agreement extends and deepens American's relationship with its existing credit card providers and is expected to generate $200 million in pretax income, incremental pretax income in the second half of 2016. It's about $100 million each quarter, $550 million in 2017 and $800 million in 2018, with modest increases in later years of the agreement. Most of the increases will be reflected in other revenue. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 3.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to a $530 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Our average mainline fuel price including taxes for the second quarter of 2016 was down 25.5% year-over-year to $1.41 per gallon. Second quarter mainline CASM was $0.1132, down 4.6% year-over-year due primarily to the lower fuel costs. 
Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0912, up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to contractual labor rate increases for our customer service and res agents and the introduction of our profit-sharing plan. These rate increases were offset in part mainly by maintenance, timing and lower selling expenses. 
Regional operating cost per ASM in the second quarter was $0.1878, down 9.8% from 2015. Excluding special items and fuel, regional CASM has decreased by 4.6%. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $9.5 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investment of $7.1 billion and $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had $460 million classified as restricted cash. This is a reduction of $51 million since the last quarter. And during the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations and paid $1.9 billion in debt. 
During the quarter, the company completed several efficient financing transactions, including the issuance of a new $1 billion 7-year term loan secured by the company's mainline spare parts and $844 million in JFK special facility bonds. In addition, the company issued the $829 million 2016-2 EETC, consisting of AA and A tranches, which was then augmented in early July with an additional $227 million B tranche, resulted in a total deal of $1.06 billion with a blended rate of 3.5%. 
In the second quarter, the company returned more than $1.7 billion to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $58 million and a repurchase of $1.7 billion of common stock or 50.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $8.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 29% from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 537.1 million shares on June 30, 2016. At the end of the second quarter, the company had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
Our liquidity of $9.5 billion at the end of second quarter was up slightly as compared to $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter and remains well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimum liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. As we discussed on our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
In regard to our fleet renewal program, when we merged in 2013, both airlines had wide-body fleet replacement plans that overlapped in 2017 and '18. As referenced in our earnings release, in order to spread out the wide-body replacement orders and our future aircraft CapEx requirements, we announced today that on July 18, we modified our purchase agreement with Airbus for 22 A350 XWB aircraft. Under this amended agreement, we will now receive our first A350 in late 2018. The deliveries are as follows: 2 in late '18 and 5 each from 2019 to 2022. This change reduces aircraft CapEx and PDPs by approximately $500 million in '17 and approximately $700 million in '18 and provides us with capacity flexibility. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, in evaluating our leverage, we look at metrics such as net debt to EBITDAR. As our fleet replacement program begins to normalize and with the deferral of our A350 aircraft deliveries, going forward, our peak capital spending for aircraft will occur in 2016 and decline going forward. As we see it today, we expect our total net debt to follow the same path, peaking in 2016 and improving each year thereafter. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We continue to monitor our capacity plans. And in our IR update issued 2 weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2%. Both from domestic and international capacity, they'll both be up around 2%. So mainline capacity will be 64.1 billion in the third and 58 billion in the fourth; and regional capacity, 8.19 billion in the third and 7.9 billion in the fourth. 
Year-over-year CASM, excluding special items and fuel, will be up approximately 4% to 6%. And regional capacity is expected to be up approximately -- or down, excuse me, approximately 3% to 5%. While fuel prices have risen since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect to see significant savings in year-over-year -- on a year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curves as of yesterday, we expect to pay between $1.39 and $1.44 per gallon in 2016. In the third quarter, we expect $1.45 to $1.50; fourth quarter, $1.48 to $1.53. Regional, we expect third quarter, $1.51 to $1.56; and in the fourth quarter, $1.54 to $1.59. Based on these prices, we expect 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Scott will give, we expect the third quarter pretax margin excluding special items to be between 12% and 14%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in '16 with approximately $803 million occurring in the third quarter, and we still expect non-aircraft CapEx to be $1.2 billion for the year. 
In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, they again delivered strong quarterly results. While we still have a lot of work to do to fully complete our integration, we're excited about the commercial initiatives our team has implemented as well as those they are working on and look forward to reporting on our continued success on future calls. 
Thanks again for your time this morning, and I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the revenue environment."

I'll start by talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis, for the first half of",686,"Thanks, Derek. I'll start by talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. 
American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis, for the first half of the year, all performance metrics improved for both mainline and regional operations, especially D-zero, which is up 3.3 points for mainline and 10.3 points for regional; and our mishandled bag rate, which has been reduced by 24%. Of course, summer thunderstorms and high load factors bring incremental challenges for our team, but the people of American Airlines are continuing to do a great job taking care of our customers and improving the operation month in and month out. 
On the revenue front, 2Q PRASM came in at the high end of our forecast. And while it's still a challenging revenue environment, 2Q is better or less bad than 1Q. So we have at least started to see some second derivative improvement in PRASM. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 5%. We saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Phoenix, followed by DFW as our second best-performing year-over-year hub. 
Internationally, as we're beginning to overlap the dollar strengthening last year, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges is getting smaller and drove a 0.6% decline in PRASM. The Atlantic was once again our best-performing international region despite the high levels of capacity growth, with PRASM down 6%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 15% on 21% ASM growth, with continued weakness in both Japan and China but good PRASM results in Hong Kong and Korea. Latin PRASM was down 10%, but we saw a particular strength in Mexico and Argentina and an improving trend in Brazil. 
Looking forward, we expect the third quarter to continue showing modest second derivative improvement in year-over-year PRASM. Regionally, we expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. But domestically and in Latin America, we expect to continue the improvement relative to the second quarter, which will result in low single-digits PRASM declines in both entities. We see particular strength in Mexico, and it appears that capacity cuts are finally starting to catch up to the declining demand in Brazil. Also, we will begin benefiting from the new credit card deals though most of that revenue will show up in other revenue. 
With that, we expect our total RASM, not passenger but total RASM, to be down 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year, with about 1 point of that coming from the new credit card deals. And going forward, we plan to continue guiding to total revenue -- to total RASM. 
While we don't really have enough bookings or data to have a forecast that's any more reliable than the analyst community, as we look to 4Q and beyond, we expect to see continued second derivative improvement in the year-over-year total RASM performance, and we're looking forward to getting back to growing RASM. 
We're also excited with our plans to introduce basic economy towards the end of this year and premium economy at some point in 2017. We believe that product segmentation is a transformative change in how we segment the product to give all of our customers choice in what they prefer, whether it's a more inclusive product bundle or just a barebone low price. Also, as Derek mentioned, we also lowered our capacity guidance for the back half of the year, which is really just a normal and natural reaction to a decline in year-over-year PRASM and higher fuel environment. 
In conclusion, we still dislike negative RASM, but we feel good about the path that we're on to get back to RASM growth. We continue making gradual improvements in our core results. Our new credit card deal will add significantly to revenues over the next few years, and we have some big opportunities ahead of us with product segmentation. 
When you put it all together, we feel very good about the foundation that we're building for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operation and drive higher revenues."

The one place, internationally at least, where we've finally started to see capacity start to rightsize to -- well, I don't know if rightsize is the right term -- start to at least adjust to the demand environment is South America, where Brazil actually saw declining capacity, and we continue to see declining capacity going forward. Domestically, I mean, it's mostly across the board. We still see higher growth in Dallas out of Love Field. The good news for us is that growth, as we get to September, we will overlap the last phase of Southwest growth. And so at least the head-to-head competitive environment for us relative to where it has been will improve in September. But really, there's been a lot of growth everywhere. Los Angeles has been a high-growth market. But I don't think, other than Dallas, I would single out any particular market for high growth. It's been across the board."

So I guess we're seeing something a little different, and all of our competitors said it. Closing yields are still down year-over-year, they're still negative, but we certainly haven't seen another leg down. Actually, I would have said it's probably quite the opposite, that things look marginally less that for us on closing yields. But some of that is probably because we do, I think, have a little bit different competitive environment on a year-over-year basis. We've had some huge headwinds from a competitive perspective. Dallas Love Field is one of those big headwinds domestically that drove a lot of, like, capacity growth in our market. And now we're starting to overlap that. And so we have what would be a more normal comparison with the rest of the industry looking forward. And so that probably means that we're looking -- we're seeing something perhaps that's a little different than our competitors on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, we've had, on a year-over-year basis, while we still probably have the most exposure to ultra low-cost carriers of any airline, they aren't going in our markets anymore, at least to a large degree. And so we have less of that incremental pressure, and they're adding capacity in other places. And when they do, that causes closing yields to decline in those markets. But we've already had that, and we're overlapping now on a year-over-year basis where they're effectively flat in our markets. And then third, we've been less involved in some of the pricing -- I don't think is the right word -- pricing issues going on between airlines. We've been involved on the periphery, but some others have been more involved in lowering fares in each of these markets than we have. As we've probably benefited from not being quite as involved in that."

We took a step back from, well, a few big things that disproportionately impacted American. And these kind of things are cyclical, and they'll eventually come back. But you look at Venezuela first, which had RASM that was 4x our system average, and the country fell apart. And you had Brazil, which was 80-something percent above system average, and the country fell apart. Those were massive, massive headwinds that drove 3 to 4 points -- just those 2 issues, 3 to 4 of points of system PRASM and 3 to 4 points of margin decline. So the hell we had to overcome to get back on those things was bigger because those big macro exogenous events disproportionately impacted American. That said, it feels like we're -- those things are about to be in the rearview mirror. Brazil is no longer a negative. Venezuela is still a big negative. It's still -- RASM is going to be down 35% this coming quarter again, but it's coming off a much smaller base. And so now you have something to call out as a system-level impact because it's coming off a smaller base. So we've had some really big headwinds between that and Dallas Love Field growth. And those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror, and we have a more normalized, at least on a year-over-year basis, comparison to the rest of the industry. And I think you're starting to already see our -- as we look out, our RASM results start to reflect that. We've also been -- had at least one hand tied behind our backs in the last few years as you get through integration and you have all your resources, you have systems locked down that even when you know you want to make changes, you can't because you're in the middle of converting the systems. And our hands are getting untied now. We still have some of that work left to do, but there's more coming. We'd have had basic economy and premium economy, which I've said, I think, are worth -- I'll be disappointed if they're not $1 billion a year. We'd have those done by now if we hadn't been in the middle of an integration. But we have been in the middle of an integration, and we've had to get through that. So I think we're going to continue to knock those kinds of and many other smaller projects out along the way and that we're on a good path. We got our credit card deal done. Others get theirs done ahead of time. We get ours done.

Listen, Scott, you've avoided fuel hedging in the past, believing that fuel prices and passenger demand would broadly move in conjunction with one another.

And by the way, fuel and capacity have been volatile in the past, yet the revenue-to-GDP relationship was broadly unaffected. So I have 2 questions. First, what explains the disconnect? Is it secular or self-inflicted? And two, if the relationship is decoupling and continues to do so, then your primary argument against fuel hedging is no longer valid. Thoughts?"

Second, I think there has been another structural change in the industry, and that has been in particular the growth of ultra low-cost carriers. That is a structural change, a structural change that required a structural response. The structural response is twofold. It's, one, to compete with them, which we're doing, and the second one is product segmentation. It has been a structural change in the industry, where 20 years ago, we segmented customer demand based on fare rules. And if you're a business traveler, you're -- the higher the fares, the low fares, which were designed for leisure customers, required a Saturday night stay, you had to buy 21 days in advance. And that didn't work for business travelers. That kind of segmentation doesn't work in today's world anymore, and so we have to change the model. And changing the model is going to product segmentation, which is what basic economy and premium economy are all about. Now I wish we could have done that by snapping our fingers like we could make a change in the fare filing in this ultra low-cost carriers group that we could have immediately effected that change, but we couldn't. And so we had to compete first, and then we'll get to segmentation, starting with basic economy later this year and premium economy next year. And I think that's going to address the secular change from ultra low-cost carriers. But we probably -- we have taken a leg down because of that, and I think we'll recover it once we get those things in effect. As to the fuel hedging question, there's 2 reasons to not hedge fuel, and [indiscernible] tied to revenue is maybe the second one. The biggest reason to not hedge fuel is because it's rigged the game that's impossible to beat. Fuel prices most of the time are trading at contango. So while fuel is $47 a barrel today, if we try to buy fuel for -- a year from now, it's well north of that. In addition, we all realize the risk that you take if you just do countless callers. And so what most people do and the prudent view is that you should buy options. So if you want to buy an option for fuel a year from now, you're going to pay an $8 to $10 option premium. So fuel prices have to go up -- varies from time to time depending on how big a contango is and how high volatility is, but in the 30% to 50% range just to break even. And when you're playing a game that you have to have oil go up 30% to 50% to break even, it's impossible to win in the long term. It can be days that you win or it can be months that you win, but it is impossible to win in the long term."

So 2-plus years, depending on when they trigger Article 50. There's sort of I think of it as 3 effects. One is the currency effect, which is a pretty clear negative. Actually, when we look by currency-by-currency, what has the biggest year-over-year impact, it's been the Brazilian real for a long time. It's now the U.K. pound because of the decline in currency. And by the way, we generated -- about 4% of our revenues are sold in British pounds. So currency decline is negative. The second point is that it will happen over the near to medium term. The indirect direct impact I actually think will be positive. And when I say direct impact, I mean the number of people having to fly back and forth across the North Atlantic, particularly business customers as there's a lot more consultants, lawyers, bankers that are likely to be flying back and forth, figuring out what the heck this means and what are we going to do. The third and most concerning thing that will be -- that has the potential to be negative is, in the near to medium term, is if it creates business confidence problems. We have seen historically that when there's business confidence, one of the thirst -- first things businesses do is cut the travel and entertainment budget. That's not something that would uniquely affect the U.K. or the EU, it will be a broader impact. I was gratified to see that while the market fell for 2 days after the Brexit vote, it has bounced back, and that's usually a pretty good indicator of confidence or highly correlated with confidence. And so I think it's unlikely that we're going to see a big change of confidence. So all of which means, I think, for the few years at least, there's not going to be much impact from Brexit when you sort of do those 3 items. Don't have tons of data. We have a month's worth of data so far, and our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened at least relative to the way they were before. So hard to see any evidence that it's a big problem. Longer term, the issue is going to be obviously what happens with the U.K. economy, what happens with the banking industry in particular because that is a big component of revenue across the North Atlantic and what happens from a regulatory framework. But near term, I don't anticipate an awful lot of issues."

It's going to come down even more in the third and fourth quarter. And as a result, Brazil, which was running down kind of 35% in the second quarter RASM, was down 13%. In the third quarter, we expect it to be positive. Now we're getting a boost in the third quarter from the Olympics, so I wouldn't necessarily expect the fourth quarter to remain positive.

And so we've done it, but all of our competitors have as well. And at least, as with regard to RASM, that we typically think of those extra seats as coming in at 50% of system RASM. And so when we put another 12 seats on the 737-800, that 12 seats, a 6% of capacity, means that all those flights come in, RASM is 3% lower than it otherwise would have been, the profit-positive. But I think that is -- that is probably a change that has driven lower RASM, at least across the industry. It's had a corresponding benefit on the cost side, of course, that would drive lower RASM. But we still have high-quality schedules for business travelers. And I don't think business travelers are flying less because maybe you have 14 flights today in the market instead of 15 flights a day. I don't think you're really losing any business. But people are resigned to stay home because of that."

Also in the room for our Q&A session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Bev Goulet, our Chief Information -- Integration Officer; and Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; as well as Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.
As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts' Q&A and, lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website.
A webcast of this call will be -- also will be archived on the website. And the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This co",1540,"All right. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to our 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.41 per diluted share. Excluding special charges, we reported a net profit of $1 billion or $1.77 per diluted share versus the second quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.9 billion or $2.62 per diluted share. 
As we talked about on our last 2 earnings calls, the company did reverse the val allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As a result, in 2016, the company is recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly net profit in 2016 will not be comparable to net profit in 2015. Accordingly, we believe pretax profit and pretax profit excluding net special items is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance than net income. 
On that basis, our second quarter net tax or pretax profit was $1.5 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 14.4% on a GAAP basis. Excluding special charges, our pretax profit was $1.6 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 15.4%. And as Doug said, both of these measures are the second best second quarter pretax margin in company history, 
Excluding the effect of special items and the noncash tax provision of $541 million, our second quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.81 per share, up 7.3% as compared to second quarter 2015, reflecting a 20% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the second quarter of 2016 was 70.8 billion ASMs, up 1.9% from the second quarter, with mainline up 1.2% and regional capacity up 8%. Our second quarter 2016 revenue was impacted by competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.4 billion, down 4.3% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9 billion, down 4.4% driven by 5.3% yield -- lower yields. Cargo revenues were down 10.4% to $174 million due primarily to a 12.7% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, down 2.1% versus the same period last year. 
On July 12, we did announce a new credit card agreement with Barclaycard US, Citi and MasterCard. This agreement extends and deepens American's relationship with its existing credit card providers and is expected to generate $200 million in pretax income, incremental pretax income in the second half of 2016. It's about $100 million each quarter, $550 million in 2017 and $800 million in 2018, with modest increases in later years of the agreement. Most of the increases will be reflected in other revenue. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 3.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to a $530 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Our average mainline fuel price including taxes for the second quarter of 2016 was down 25.5% year-over-year to $1.41 per gallon. Second quarter mainline CASM was $0.1132, down 4.6% year-over-year due primarily to the lower fuel costs. 
Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0912, up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to contractual labor rate increases for our customer service and res agents and the introduction of our profit-sharing plan. These rate increases were offset in part mainly by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses. 
Regional operating cost per ASM in the second quarter was $0.1878, down 9.8% from 2015. Excluding special items and fuel, regional CASM has decreased by 4.6%. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $9.5 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investment of $7.1 billion and $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had $460 million classified as restricted cash. This is a reduction of $51 million since the last quarter. And during the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations and paid $1.9 billion in debt. 
During the quarter, the company completed several efficient financing transactions, including the issuance of a new $1 billion 7-year term loan secured by the company's mainline spare parts and $844 million in JFK special facility bonds. In addition, the company issued the $829 million 2016-2 EETC, consisting of AA and A tranches, which was then augmented in early July with an additional $227 million B tranche, resulted in a total deal of $1.06 billion with a blended rate of 3.5%. 
In the second quarter, the company returned more than $1.7 billion to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $58 million and a repurchase of $1.7 billion of common stock or 50.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $8.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 29% from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 537.1 million shares on June 30, 2016. At the end of the second quarter, the company had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
Our liquidity of $9.5 billion at the end of second quarter was up slightly as compared to $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter and remains well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimum liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. As we discussed on our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
In regard to our fleet renewal program, when we merged in 2013, both airlines had wide-body fleet replacement plans that overlapped in 2017 and '18. As referenced in our earnings release, in order to spread out the wide-body replacement orders and our future aircraft CapEx requirements, we announced today that on July 18, we modified our purchase agreement with Airbus for 22 A350 XWB aircraft. Under this amended agreement, we will now receive our first A350 in late 2018. The deliveries are as follows: 2 in late '18 and 5 each from 2019 to 2022. This change reduces aircraft CapEx and PDPs by approximately $500 million in '17 and approximately $700 million in '18 and provides us with capacity flexibility. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, in evaluating our leverage, we look at metrics such as net debt to EBITDAR. As our fleet replacement program begins to normalize and with the deferral of our A350 aircraft deliveries, going forward, our peak capital spending for aircraft will occur in 2016 and decline going forward. As we see it today, we expect our total net debt to follow the same path, peaking in 2016 and improving each year thereafter. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We continue to monitor our capacity plans. And in our IR update issued 2 weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2%. Both from domestic and international capacity, they'll both be up around 2%. So mainline capacity will be 64.1 billion in the third and 58 billion in the fourth; and regional capacity, 8.19 billion in the third and 7.9 billion in the fourth. 
Year-over-year CASM, excluding special items and fuel, will be up approximately 4% to 6%. And regional capacity is expected to be up approximately -- or down, excuse me, approximately 3% to 5%. While fuel prices have risen since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect to see significant savings in year-over-year -- on a year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curves as of yesterday, we expect to pay between $1.39 and $1.44 per gallon in 2016. In the third quarter, we expect $1.45 to $1.50; fourth quarter, $1.48 to $1.53. Regional, we expect third quarter, $1.51 to $1.56; and in the fourth quarter, $1.54 to $1.59. Based on these prices, we expect 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Scott will give, we expect the third quarter pretax margin excluding special items to be between 12% and 14%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in '16 with approximately $803 million occurring in the third quarter, and we still expect non-aircraft CapEx to be $1.2 billion for the year. 
In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, they again delivered strong quarterly results. While we still have a lot of work to do to fully complete our integration, we're excited about the commercial initiatives our team has implemented as well as those they are working on and look forward to reporting on our continued success on future calls. 
Thanks again for your time this morning, and I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the revenue environment."

I'll start by talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis, for the first half of",685,"Thanks, Derek. I'll start by talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. 
American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis, for the first half of the year, all performance metrics improved for both mainline and regional operations, especially D-zero, which is up 3.3 points for mainline and 10.3 points for regional; and our mishandled bag rate, which has been reduced by 24%. Of course, summer thunderstorms and high load factors bring incremental challenges for our team, but the people of American Airlines are continuing to do a great job taking care of our customers and improving the operation month in and month out. 
On the revenue front, 2Q PRASM came in at the high end of our forecast. And while it's still a challenging revenue environment, 2Q is better or less bad than 1Q. So we have at least started to see some second derivative improvement in PRASM. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 5%. We saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Phoenix, followed by DFW as our second best-performing year-over-year hub. 
Internationally, as we're beginning to overlap the dollar strengthening last year, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges is getting smaller and drove a 0.6% decline in PRASM. The Atlantic was once again our best-performing international region despite the high levels of capacity growth, with PRASM down 6%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 15% on 21% ASM growth, with continued weakness in both Japan and China but good PRASM results in Hong Kong and Korea. Latin PRASM was down 10%, but we saw a particular strength in Mexico and Argentina and an improving trend in Brazil. 
Looking forward, we expect the third quarter to continue showing modest second derivative improvement in year-over-year PRASM. Regionally, we expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. But domestically and in Latin America, we expect to continue the improvement relative to the second quarter, which will result in low single-digits PRASM declines in both entities. We see particular strength in Mexico, and it appears that capacity cuts are finally starting to catch up to the declining demand in Brazil. Also, we will begin benefiting from the new credit card deals though most of that revenue will show up in other revenue. 
With that, we expect our total RASM, not passenger but total RASM, to be down 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year, with about 1 point of that coming from the new credit card deals. And going forward, we plan to continue guiding to total revenue -- to total RASM. 
While we don't really have enough bookings or data to have a forecast that's any more reliable than the analyst community, as we look to 4Q and beyond, we expect to see continued second derivative improvement in the year-over-year total RASM performance, and we're looking forward to getting back to growing RASM. 
We're also excited with our plans to introduce basic economy towards the end of this year and premium economy at some point in 2017. We believe that product segmentation is a transformative change in how we segment the product to give all of our customers choice in what they prefer, whether it's a more inclusive product bundle or just a barebone low price. Also, as Derek mentioned, we also lowered our capacity guidance for the back half of the year, which is really just a normal and natural reaction to a declining year-over-year PRASM and higher fuel environment. 
In conclusion, we still dislike negative RASM, but we feel good about the path that we're on to get back to RASM growth. We continue making gradual improvements in our core results. Our new credit card deal will add significantly to revenues over the next few years, and we have some big opportunities ahead of us with product segmentation. 
When you put it all together, we feel very good about the foundation that we're building for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operation and drive higher revenues."

The one place, internationally at least, where we've finally started to see capacity start to rightsize to -- well, I don't know if rightsize is the right term -- start to at least adjust to the demand environment is South America, where Brazil actually saw declining capacity, and we continue to see declining capacity going forward. Domestically, I mean, it's mostly across the board. We still see higher growth in Dallas out of Love Field. The good news for us is that growth, as we get to September, we will overlap the last phase of Southwest growth. And so at least the head-to-head competitive environment for us relative to where it has been will improve in September. But really, there's been a lot of growth everywhere. Los Angeles has been a high-growth market. But I don't think, other than Dallas, I would single out any particular market for high growth. It's been across the board."

Closing yields are still down year-over-year, they're still negative, but we certainly haven't seen another leg down. Actually, I would have said it's probably quite the opposite, that things look marginally less bad for us on closing yields. But some of that is probably because we do, I think, have a little bit different competitive environment on a year-over-year basis. We've had some huge headwinds from a competitive perspective. Dallas Love Field is one of those big headwinds domestically that drove a lot of, like, capacity growth in our market. And now we're starting to overlap that. And so we have what would be a more normal comparison with the rest of the industry looking forward. And so that probably means that we're looking -- we're seeing something perhaps that's a little different than our competitors on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, we've had, on a year-over-year basis, while we still probably have the most exposure to ultra low-cost carriers of any airline, they aren't growing in our markets anymore, at least to a large degree. And so we have less of that incremental pressure, and they're adding capacity in other places. And when they do, that causes closing yields to decline in those markets. But we've already had that, and we're overlapping now on a year-over-year basis where they're effectively flat in our markets. And then third, we've been less involved in some of the pricing -- I don't think is the right word -- pricing issues going on between airlines. We've been involved on the periphery, but some others have been more involved in lowering fares in each of these markets than we have. As we've probably benefited from not being quite as involved in that."

We took a step back from, well, a few big things that disproportionately impacted American. And these kind of things are cyclical, and they'll eventually come back. But you look at Venezuela first, which had RASM that was 4x our system average, and the country fell apart. And you had Brazil, which was 80-something percent above system average, and the country fell apart. Those were massive, massive headwinds that drove 3 to 4 points -- just those 2 issues, 3 to 4 of points of system PRASM and 3 to 4 points of margin decline. So the h*** we had to overcome to get back on those things was bigger because those big macro exogenous events disproportionately impacted American. That said, it feels like we're -- those things are about to be in the rearview mirror. Brazil is no longer a negative. Venezuela is still a big negative. It's still -- RASM is going to be down 35% this coming quarter again, but it's coming off a much smaller base. And so now you have something to call out as a system-level impact because it's coming off a smaller base. So we've had some really big headwinds between that and Dallas Love Field growth. And those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror, and we have a more normalized, at least on a year-over-year basis, comparison to the rest of the industry. And I think you're starting to already see our -- as we look out, our RASM results start to reflect that. We've also been -- had at least one hand tied behind our backs in the last few years as you get through integration and you have all your resources, you have systems locked down that even when you know you want to make changes, you can't because you're in the middle of converting the systems. And our hands are getting untied now. We still have some of that work left to do, but there's more coming. We'd have had basic economy and premium economy, which I've said, I think, are worth -- I'll be disappointed if they're not $1 billion a year. We'd have those done by now if we hadn't been in the middle of an integration. But we have been in the middle of an integration, and we've had to get through that. So I think we're going to continue to knock those kinds of and many other smaller projects out along the way and that we're on a good path. We got our credit card deal done. Others get theirs done ahead of time. We get ours done.

Listen, Scott, you've avoided fuel hedging in the past, believing that fuel prices and passenger demand would broadly move in conjunction with one another. If you look at current revenue and GDP trends now, that time-held relationship has decoupled for the first time since the financial crisis or the advent of the Internet. And by the way, fuel and capacity have been volatile in the past, yet the revenue-to-GDP relationship was broadly unaffected. So I have 2 questions. First, what explains the disconnect? Is it secular or self-inflicted? And two, if the relationship is decoupling and continues to do so, then your primary argument against fuel hedging is no longer valid. Thoughts?"

First, I think there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with a lag. I've historically said 4 to 6 months, one of our competitors said 9 months. It does come with a lag. And I think revenue",629,"Okay, so I'll try on both of those. First, I think there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with a lag. I've historically said 4 to 6 months, one of our competitors said 9 months. It does come with a lag. And I think revenues will be higher in the fourth quarter than they otherwise would have been if fuel was lower. Now fuel prices at whatever it was yesterday, $47 a barrel, while it took a very brief spike down to $35 a barrel, I doubt capacity ever adjusted all the way down to $35 a barrel, and you saw earnings improve dramatically as a result. So I'm not sure what the right comparison is, if it was $35 a barrel or $47 a barrel where people were planning capacity from, but I think there still is a link. Second, I think there has been another structural change in the industry, and that has been in particular the growth of ultra-low-cost carriers. That is a structural change, a structural change that required a structural response. The structural response is twofold. It's, one, to compete with them, which we're doing, and the second one is product segmentation. It has been a structural change in the industry, where 20 years ago, we segmented customer demand based on fare rules. And if you're a business traveler, you're -- the higher the fares, the low fares, which were designed for leisure customers, required a Saturday night stay, you had to buy 21 days in advance. And that didn't work for business travelers. That kind of segmentation doesn't work in today's world anymore. And so we have to change the model. And changing the model is going to product segmentation, which is what basic economy and premium economy are all about. Now I wish we could have done that by snapping our fingers like we could make a change in the fare filing in this ultra-low-cost carriers group that we could have immediately effected that change, but we couldn't. And so we had to compete first, and then we'll get to segmentation, starting with basic economy later this year and premium economy next year. And I think that's going to address the secular change from ultra-low-cost carriers. But we probably -- we have taken a leg down because of that, and I think we'll recover it once we get those things in effect. As to the fuel hedging question, there's 2 reasons to not hedge fuel, and actually I would have said the ""tied to revenue"" is maybe the second one. The biggest reason to not hedge fuel is because it's a rigged game that's impossible to beat. Fuel prices most of the time are trading at contango. So while fuel is $47 a barrel today, if we try to buy fuel for -- a year from now, it's well north of that. In addition, we all realize the risk that you take if you just do costless collars. And so what most people do and the prudent view is that you should buy options. So if you want to buy an option for fuel a year from now, you're going to pay an $8 to $10 option premium. So fuel prices have to go up -- varies from time to time depending on how big a contango is and how high volatility is, but in the 30% to 50% range just to break even.

So 2-plus years, depending on when they trigger Article 50. There's sort of I think of it as 3 effects. One is the currency effect, which is a pretty clear negative. Actually, when we look by currency-by-currency, what has the biggest year-over-year impact, it's been the Brazilian real for a long time. It's now the U.K. pound because of the decline in currency. And by the way, we generated -- about 4% of our revenues are sold in British pounds. So currency decline is negative. The second point is that it will happen over the near to medium term. The direct impact I actually think will be positive. And when I say direct impact, I mean the number of people having to fly back and forth across the North Atlantic, particularly business customers as there's a lot more consultants, lawyers, bankers that are likely to be flying back and forth, figuring out what the heck this means and what are we going to do. The third and most concerning thing that will be -- that has the potential to be negative is, in the near to medium term, is if it creates business confidence problems. We have seen historically that when there's business confidence, one of the thirst -- first things businesses do is cut the travel and entertainment budget. That's not something that would uniquely affect the U.K. or the EU, it will be a broader impact. I was gratified to see that while the market fell for 2 days after the Brexit vote, it has bounced back, and that's usually a pretty good indicator of confidence or highly correlated with confidence. And so I think it's unlikely that we're going to see a big change of confidence. So all of which means, I think, for the few years at least, there's not going to be much impact from Brexit when you sort of do those 3 items. Don't have tons of data. We have a month's worth of data so far, and our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened at least relative to where they were before. So hard to see any evidence that it's a big problem. Longer term, the issue is going to be obviously what happens with the U.K. economy, what happens with the banking industry in particular because that is a big component of revenue across the North Atlantic and what happens from a regulatory framework. But near term, I don't anticipate an awful lot of issues."

It's one, there is more economic uncertainty. It's not just around Brexit, there's more economic uncertainty, and it's a challenging economic environment in Europe, so the macro is not good. You've got accelerating capacity growth across the Atlantic, so it's a second strike for Europe. And third is currency.

It's going to come down even more in the third and fourth quarter. And as a result, Brazil, which was running down kind of 35% in the second quarter RASM, was down 13%.

In this case, Brazil is so bad that there is no business traffic or close to no business traffic. And so this year, I think that will be a positive just because Brazil had fallen so much before. Two years ago I would have thought the Olympics would be a negative, and it would have been 2 years ago. But today, because things have fallen so much, they're going to actually be a positive."

Also in the room for our Q&A session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Bev Goulet, our Chief Information -- Integration Officer; and Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; as well as Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs.
As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts' Q&A and, lastly, questions from the media.
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website.
A webcast of this call will be -- also will be archived on the website. And the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This co",1540,"All right. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to our 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.41 per diluted share. Excluding special charges, we reported a net profit of $1 billion or $1.77 per diluted share versus the second quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.9 billion or $2.62 per diluted share. 
As we talked about on our last 2 earnings calls, the company did reverse the val allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As a result, in 2016, the company is recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially noncash due to its utilization of NOLs. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly net profit in 2016 will not be comparable to net profit in 2015. Accordingly, we believe pretax profit and pretax profit excluding net special items is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance than net income. 
On that basis, our second quarter net tax or pretax profit was $1.5 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 14.4% on a GAAP basis. Excluding special charges, our pretax profit was $1.6 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 15.4%. And as Doug said, both of these measures are the second best second quarter pretax margin in company history, 
Excluding the effect of special items and the noncash tax provision of $541 million, our second quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.81 per share, up 7.3% as compared to second quarter 2015, reflecting a 20% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. 
Total capacity for the second quarter of 2016 was 70.8 billion ASMs, up 1.9% from the second quarter, with mainline up 1.2% and regional capacity up 8%. Our second quarter 2016 revenue was impacted by competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.4 billion, down 4.3% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9 billion, down 4.4% driven by 5.3% yield -- lower yields. Cargo revenues were down 10.4% to $174 million due primarily to a 12.7% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, down 2.1% versus the same period last year. 
On July 12, we did announce a new credit card agreement with Barclaycard US, Citi and MasterCard. This agreement extends and deepens American's relationship with its existing credit card providers and is expected to generate $200 million in pretax income, incremental pretax income in the second half of 2016. It's about $100 million each quarter, $550 million in 2017 and $800 million in 2018, with modest increases in later years of the agreement. Most of the increases will be reflected in other revenue. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 3.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to a $530 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Our average mainline fuel price including taxes for the second quarter of 2016 was down 25.5% year-over-year to $1.41 per gallon. Second quarter mainline CASM was $0.1132, down 4.6% year-over-year due primarily to the lower fuel costs. 
Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was $0.0912, up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to contractual labor rate increases for our customer service and res agents and the introduction of our profit-sharing plan. These rate increases were offset in part mainly by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses. 
Regional operating cost per ASM in the second quarter was $0.1878, down 9.8% from 2015. Excluding special items and fuel, regional CASM has decreased by 4.6%. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $9.5 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investment of $7.1 billion and $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had $460 million classified as restricted cash. This is a reduction of $51 million since the last quarter. And during the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations and paid $1.9 billion in debt. 
During the quarter, the company completed several efficient financing transactions, including the issuance of a new $1 billion 7-year term loan secured by the company's mainline spare parts and $844 million in JFK special facility bonds. In addition, the company issued the $829 million 2016-2 EETC, consisting of AA and A tranches, which was then augmented in early July with an additional $227 million B tranche, resulted in a total deal of $1.06 billion with a blended rate of 3.5%. 
In the second quarter, the company returned more than $1.7 billion to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $58 million and a repurchase of $1.7 billion of common stock or 50.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $8.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 29% from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 537.1 million shares on June 30, 2016. At the end of the second quarter, the company had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
Our liquidity of $9.5 billion at the end of second quarter was up slightly as compared to $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter and remains well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimum liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. As we discussed on our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. 
In regard to our fleet renewal program, when we merged in 2013, both airlines had wide-body fleet replacement plans that overlapped in 2017 and '18. As referenced in our earnings release, in order to spread out the wide-body replacement orders and our future aircraft CapEx requirements, we announced today that on July 18, we modified our purchase agreement with Airbus for 22 A350 XWB aircraft. Under this amended agreement, we will now receive our first A350 in late 2018. The deliveries are as follows: 2 in late '18 and 5 each from 2019 to 2022. This change reduces aircraft CapEx and PDPs by approximately $500 million in '17 and approximately $700 million in '18 and provides us with capacity flexibility. 
As we discussed on our last earnings call, in evaluating our leverage, we look at metrics such as net debt to EBITDAR. As our fleet replacement program begins to normalize and with the deferral of our A350 aircraft deliveries, going forward, our peak capital spending for aircraft will occur in 2016 and decline going forward. As we see it today, we expect our total net debt to follow the same path, peaking in 2016 and improving each year thereafter. 
Turning to our 2016 guidance. We continue to monitor our capacity plans. And in our IR update issued 2 weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2%. Both from domestic and international capacity, they'll both be up around 2%. So mainline capacity will be 64.1 billion in the third and 58 billion in the fourth; and regional capacity, 8.19 billion in the third and 7.9 billion in the fourth. 
Year-over-year CASM, excluding special items and fuel, will be up approximately 4% to 6%. And regional capacity is expected to be up approximately -- or down, excuse me, approximately 3% to 5%. While fuel prices have risen since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect to see significant savings in year-over-year -- on a year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curves as of yesterday, we expect to pay between $1.39 and $1.44 per gallon in 2016. In the third quarter, we expect $1.45 to $1.50; fourth quarter, $1.48 to $1.53. Regional, we expect third quarter, $1.51 to $1.56; and in the fourth quarter, $1.54 to $1.59. Based on these prices, we expect 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Scott will give, we expect the third quarter pretax margin excluding special items to be between 12% and 14%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in '16 with approximately $803 million occurring in the third quarter, and we still expect non-aircraft CapEx to be $1.2 billion for the year. 
In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, they again delivered strong quarterly results. While we still have a lot of work to do to fully complete our integration, we're excited about the commercial initiatives our team has implemented as well as those they are working on and look forward to reporting on our continued success on future calls. 
Thanks again for your time this morning, and I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the revenue environment."

I'll start by talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis, for the first half of",685,"Thanks, Derek. I'll start by talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. 
American's operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis, for the first half of the year, all performance metrics improved for both mainline and regional operations, especially D-zero, which is up 3.3 points for mainline and 10.3 points for regional; and our mishandled bag rate, which has been reduced by 24%. Of course, summer thunderstorms and high load factors bring incremental challenges for our team, but the people of American Airlines are continuing to do a great job taking care of our customers and improving the operation month in and month out. 
On the revenue front, 2Q PRASM came in at the high end of our forecast. And while it's still a challenging revenue environment, 2Q is better or less bad than 1Q. So we have at least started to see some second derivative improvement in PRASM. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 5%. We saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Phoenix, followed by DFW as our second best-performing year-over-year hub. 
Internationally, as we're beginning to overlap the dollar strengthening last year, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges is getting smaller and drove a 0.6% decline in PRASM. The Atlantic was once again our best-performing international region despite the high levels of capacity growth, with PRASM down 6%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 15% on 21% ASM growth, with continued weakness in both Japan and China but good PRASM results in Hong Kong and Korea. Latin PRASM was down 10%, but we saw a particular strength in Mexico and Argentina and an improving trend in Brazil. 
Looking forward, we expect the third quarter to continue showing modest second derivative improvement in year-over-year PRASM. Regionally, we expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. But domestically and in Latin America, we expect to continue the improvement relative to the second quarter, which will result in low single-digits PRASM declines in both entities. We see particular strength in Mexico, and it appears that capacity cuts are finally starting to catch up to the declining demand in Brazil. Also, we will begin benefiting from the new credit card deals though most of that revenue will show up in other revenue. 
With that, we expect our total RASM, not passenger but total RASM, to be down 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year, with about 1 point of that coming from the new credit card deals. And going forward, we plan to continue guiding to total revenue -- to total RASM. 
While we don't really have enough bookings or data to have a forecast that's any more reliable than the analyst community, as we look to 4Q and beyond, we expect to see continued second derivative improvement in the year-over-year total RASM performance, and we're looking forward to getting back to growing RASM. 
We're also excited with our plans to introduce basic economy towards the end of this year and premium economy at some point in 2017. We believe that product segmentation is a transformative change in how we segment the product to give all of our customers’ choice in what they prefer, whether it's a more inclusive product bundle or just a barebone low price. Also, as Derek mentioned, we also lowered our capacity guidance for the back half of the year, which is really just a normal and natural reaction to a declining year-over-year PRASM and higher fuel environment. 
In conclusion, we still dislike negative RASM, but we feel good about the path that we're on to get back to RASM growth. We continue making gradual improvements in our core results. Our new credit card deal will add significantly to revenues over the next few years, and we have some big opportunities ahead of us with product segmentation. 
When you put it all together, we feel very good about the foundation that we're building for the long term, which will enable us to run the world's best operation and drive higher revenues."

Domestically, I mean, it's mostly across the board. We still see higher growth in Dallas out of Love Field. The good news for us is that growth, as we get to September, we will overlap the last phase of Southwest growth. And so at least the head-to-head competitive environment for us relative to where it has been will improve in September. But really, there's been a lot of growth everywhere.

Closing yields are still down year-over-year, they're still negative, but we certainly haven't seen another leg down. Actually, I would have said it's probably quite the opposite, that things look marginally less bad for us on closing yields. But some of that is probably because we do, I think, have a little bit different competitive environment on a year-over-year basis. We've had some huge headwinds from a competitive perspective. Dallas Love Field is one of those big headwinds domestically that drove a lot of, like, capacity growth in our market. And now we're starting to overlap that. And so we have what would be a more normal comparison with the rest of the industry looking forward. And so that probably means that we're looking -- we're seeing something perhaps that's a little different than our competitors on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, we've had, on a year-over-year basis, while we still probably have the most exposure to ultra low-cost carriers of any airline, they aren't growing in our markets anymore, at least to a large degree. And so we have less of that incremental pressure, and they're adding capacity in other places. And when they do, that causes closing yields to decline in those markets. But we've already had that, and we're overlapping now on a year-over-year basis where they're effectively flat in our markets. And then third, we've been less involved in some of the pricing -- I don't think is the right word -- pricing issues going on between airlines. We've been involved on the periphery, but some others have been more involved in lowering fares in each of these markets than we have. As we've probably benefited from not being quite as involved in that."

We took a step back from, well, a few big things that disproportionately impacted American. And these kind of things are cyclical, and they'll eventually come back. But you look at Venezuela first, which had RASM that was 4x our system average, and the country fell apart. And you had Brazil, which was 80-something percent above system average, and the country fell apart. Those were massive, massive headwinds that drove 3 to 4 points -- just those 2 issues, 3 to 4 of points of system PRASM and 3 to 4 points of margin decline. So the h*** we had to overcome to get back on those things was bigger because those big macro exogenous events disproportionately impacted American. That said, it feels like we're -- those things are about to be in the rearview mirror. Brazil is no longer a negative. Venezuela is still a big negative. It's still -- RASM is going to be down 35% this coming quarter again, but it's coming off a much smaller base. And so now you have something to call out as a system-level impact because it's coming off a smaller base. So we've had some really big headwinds between that and Dallas Love Field growth. And those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror, and we have a more normalized, at least on a year-over-year basis, comparison to the rest of the industry. And I think you're starting to already see our -- as we look out, our RASM results start to reflect that. We've also been -- had at least one hand tied behind our backs in the last few years as you get through integration and you have all your resources, you have systems locked down that even when you know you want to make changes, you can't because you're in the middle of converting the systems. And our hands are getting untied now. We still have some of that work left to do, but there's more coming. We'd have had basic economy and premium economy, which I've said, I think, are worth -- I'll be disappointed if they're not $1 billion a year. We'd have those done by now if we hadn't been in the middle of an integration. But we have been in the middle of an integration, and we've had to get through that. So I think we're going to continue to knock those kinds of and many other smaller projects out along the way and that we're on a good path. We got our credit card deal done. Others get theirs done ahead of time. We get ours done.

Listen, Scott, you've avoided fuel hedging in the past, believing that fuel prices and passenger demand would broadly move in conjunction with one another. If you look at current revenue and GDP trends now, that time-held relationship has decoupled for the first time since the financial crisis or the advent of the Internet. And by the way, fuel and capacity have been volatile in the past, yet the revenue-to-GDP relationship was broadly unaffected. So I have 2 questions. First, what explains the disconnect? Is it secular or self-inflicted? And two, if the relationship is decoupling and continues to do so, then your primary argument against fuel hedging is no longer valid. Thoughts?"

First, I think there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with a lag. I've historically said 4 to 6 months, one of our competitors said 9 months. It does come with a lag. And I think revenue",629,"Okay, so I'll try on both of those. First, I think there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with a lag. I've historically said 4 to 6 months, one of our competitors said 9 months. It does come with a lag. And I think revenues will be higher in the fourth quarter than they otherwise would have been if fuel was lower. Now fuel prices at whatever it was yesterday, $47 a barrel, while it took a very brief spike down to $35 a barrel, I doubt capacity ever adjusted all the way down to $35 a barrel, and you saw earnings improve dramatically as a result. So I'm not sure what the right comparison is, if it was $35 a barrel or $47 a barrel where people were planning capacity from, but I think there still is a link. Second, I think there has been another structural change in the industry, and that has been in particular the growth of ultra-low-cost carriers. That is a structural change, a structural change that required a structural response. The structural response is twofold. It's, one, to compete with them, which we're doing, and the second one is product segmentation. It has been a structural change in the industry, where 20 years ago, we segmented customer demand based on fare rules. And if you're a business traveler, you're -- the higher the fares, the low fares, which were designed for leisure customers, required a Saturday night stay, you had to buy 21 days in advance. And that didn't work for business travelers. That kind of segmentation doesn't work in today's world anymore. And so we have to change the model. And changing the model is going to product segmentation, which is what basic economy and premium economy are all about. Now I wish we could have done that by snapping our fingers like we could make a change in the fare filing in this ultra-low-cost carriers group that we could have immediately effected that change, but we couldn't. And so we had to compete first, and then we'll get to segmentation, starting with basic economy later this year and premium economy next year. And I think that's going to address the secular change from ultra-low-cost carriers. But we probably -- we have taken a leg down because of that, and I think we'll recover it once we get those things in effect. As to the fuel hedging question, there's 2 reasons to not hedge fuel, and actually I would have said the ""tied to revenue"" is maybe the second one. The biggest reason to not hedge fuel is because it's a rigged game that's impossible to beat. Fuel prices most of the time are trading at contango. So while fuel is $47 a barrel today, if we try to buy fuel for -- a year from now, it's well north of that. In addition, we all realize the risk that you take if you just do costless collars. And so what most people do and the prudent view is that you should buy options. So if you want to buy an option for fuel a year from now, you're going to pay an $8 to $10 option premium. So fuel prices have to go up -- varies from time to time depending on how big a contango is and how high volatility is, but in the 30% to 50% range just to break even. And when you're playing a game that you have to have oil go up 30% to 50% to break even, it's impossible to win in the long term. It can be days that you win or it can be months that you win, but it is impossible to win in the long term."

The third and most concerning thing that will be -- that has the potential to be negative is, in the near to medium term, is if it creates business confidence problems. We have seen historically that when there's business confidence, one of the thirst -- first things businesses do is cut the travel and entertainment budget. That's not something that would uniquely affect the U.K. or the EU, it will be a broader impact. I was gratified to see that while the market fell for 2 days after the Brexit vote, it has bounced back, and that's usually a pretty good indicator of confidence or highly correlated with confidence. And so I think it's unlikely that we're going to see a big change of confidence. So all of which means, I think, for the few years at least, there's not going to be much impact from Brexit when you sort of do those 3 items. Don't have tons of data. We have a month's worth of data so far, and our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened at least relative to where they were before. So hard to see any evidence that it's a big problem. Longer term, the issue is going to be obviously what happens with the U.K. economy, what happens with the banking industry in particular because that is a big component of revenue across the North Atlantic and what happens from a regulatory framework. But near term, I don't anticipate an awful lot of issues."

It's one, there is more economic uncertainty. It's not just around Brexit, there's more economic uncertainty, and it's a challenging economic environment in Europe, so the macro is not good. You've got accelerating capacity growth across the Atlantic, so it's a second strike for Europe. And third is currency. So the one impact of Brexit that actually isn't an identifiable negative is currency weakness.

And it's taking us time to get that done, but that's really the right structural response. So look, we feel pretty good about where we are.

Joining us on the call today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer 
Also in the room for Q&A session is Elise, our EVP of People and Communications; Dave, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs. And Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue management. 
As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call with Doug, and he will provide an overview of the third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder -- for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media. 
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast or capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can the fund in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, that can be found on our website. The webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. 
So thanks, again, for joining us this morning. And at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker."

Our pretax earnings, excluding special items of $1.5 billion. It's down from last year's $1.9 billion. That's due both by declining unit revenues, our total -- our PRASM was down 2.2% versus last year. And increasing year cost, driven primarily by investments in our team. 
But while they're down, their still second best third quarter in history in American Airlines behind only the third quarter 2015. 
Also because of our share repurchase activity, our adjusted EPS was actually up, even the earnings were down from $2.77 up to $2.80 in the quarter. 
So the results are doing fantastic team at American, done amazing job for our customers, they were extremely grateful for that they do. 
On the revenue front, Robert will provide a lot more detail, but we're encouraged by the trends. Our PRASM, as I said, was down 2.2% in the third quarter. That's better than we've seen in terms of the decline in recent quarters. It's better than our competitors are experiencing. 
In fact, the month of September PRASM was actually improved year-over-year, which was the first month of year-over-year PRASM improvement for American Airlines since November of 2014. Now, of course, September was helped by the calendar on a year-over-year basis, which is we at American would like to focus much on monthly unit revenue numbers, but the trend is good, and it appears to be continuing as Robert will discuss. 
Our unit costs grew in the quarter and Derek will provide more detail on that, but the primary driver of the unit cost increase is our decision to invest in seats. We have paid increases in profit sharing that are, by far, the largest drivers of the cost increase, and we're pleased to be able to provide those improvements to our team members. We now reached new agreements with all of our work groups, so the large increases are behind us. 
Furthermore, as we complete more of our integration in 2017, we'll be able to give eliminating some of the redundancies that still exist because of the 2 airlines, and that will help us reduce expenses in 2018 and beyond. 
As integration, we have enormous success early this month with the fall integration of our flight operating system across. This is extremely complicated system integration that's what operational disruptions in the airlines as they've gone through mergers and our team executed without a hitch. While we're doing all that, we continue to invest in our products, improve the product. We have 12 new aircraft-s as part of our unprecedented fleet renewal program report. Americans fleet is now more than 40% younger in our large network peers and that gap is widening. 
We had 10 new destinations to our network, including 5 in Cuba, a new service from LAX to Hong Kong and next month, we'll begin daily flights to Havana, strengthening our position as the largest carrier to Cuba. 
We continue to make enormous improvements to our clubs, including this quarter, the reopening of renovated Admirals Club in Rio de Janeiro and the refurbishment of our London Heathrow Arrivals Club, which now has 29 shower rooms in the business group. 
So in summary, this U.S. airline industry have been transformed and American Airlines is well positioned for success in the New World. We're producing record profits, near record profits. Despite a soft economic environment, and we're using those profits to improve customer service to important investments in both our products and our team. 
And we're returning the excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. 
While there's much work ahead, the American team continues to improve their challenge. We're extremely pleased with where we are and very bullish on the future of American Airlines. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Derek who provide more details on the financial results. And then to our recently appointed President, Robert Isom, who will discuss operating performance and revenue environment. Derek?"

Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning and then that released our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $737 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This compares to our third quarter 20",1341,"All right. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning and then that released our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $737 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This compares to our third quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.49 for diluted share and if we exclude special charges, we reported net profit of $933 million in the third quarter of 2016 or $1.76 per diluted share versus the third quarter net profit of $1.9 billion in 2015 or $2.77 per diluted share. 
Our GAAP third quarter pretax profit was $1.2 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 11.2%, excluding special charges, our third quarter pretax profit was $1.5 billion which resulted in a pretax margin of 14%. 
Excluding the effects of special charges and the noncash tax provision of $449 million, our third quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.80 per share compared to $2.77 in the third quarter of 2015, reflecting a 22% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the quarter. 
We continue to see sequential improvement in the revenue environment during the quarter, which Robert will talk more about. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.6 billion, down 1.1% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9.1 billion, down 2.2%, driven by our 0.6% decline in yields. 
Cargo revenues were down 5.1% to $171 million due primarily to a decline in international and domestic yields. 
Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 8.5% versus the same period last year due to the impact of the new credit card deals signed with Barclays U.S., Citi and MasterCard on July 12, 2016. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $9.2 billion, up 5.2% versus the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in our people through contractual increases and the introduction of profit sharing plan, investments in our product, investments which includes our fleet, as Doug talked about, and investments in our operation. These investments were offset in part by lower fuel costs. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the third quarter of 2016 was down 12.4% year-over-year to $1.46 per gallon. 
Third quarter mainline cost per ASM was $0.1196, up 5.6% year-over-year. Excluding special charges and fuel, our mainline CASM was $0.0932, up 8.9% year-over-year. Regional operating cost per ASM in the third quarter was $0.1885, which was down 5.2% from the same quarter in 2015. 
Excluding special charges in fuel, regional CASM was $0.1508, a decrease of 4.4% due to continued shift to more efficient large regional jets. 
We entered the third quarter of 2016 with approximately $9.2 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.8 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity well in the excess -- well in excess of $6.5 billion minimal liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. 
The company also had $635 million classified as restricted cash during the quarter. 
We did generate $1.1 billion during the quarter of cash flow from operations and made $372 million in debt payments. We continue to believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program, which will be substantially complete in 2017. 
During the quarter, the company took advantage of favorable market conditions, and completed several financing transactions, including a repricing of the company's 2014 term loan, collateralized by our London Heathrow slots, which reduced interest by 25 basis points and the issuance of $814 million EETC -- consisting of
[Audio Gap]
Shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share of distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 31%, from 756 million at merger close in December 2013 to 519.2 million shares on September 30, 2016. 
At the end of the third quarter 2016, the company had approximately $565 million remaining on it current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. We continue to monitor our capacity plans and in our IR update issued last week, we lowered full year 2016 system capacity guidance by 0.5 points and are forecasting it to be up approximately 1.5%. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline capacity to be 57.5 billion ASMs and our regional capacity to be 7.84 billion ASMs, so our consolidated capacity will be flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to be up approximately 5% to 7% while regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. 
For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline CASM excluding fuel and special items to be up between 8% and 10%. This year-over-year increase is driven primarily by investment in our people of about 6 points, maintenance timing of 2 points and D&A from new aircraft and increased CapEx of 1 point. 
Regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is expected to be down by approximately 3% to 5% in the same period. 
As we look forward for the first time since mid-2014, year-over-year fuel prices are expected to be higher through the remainder of the year. Based on the forward curve as of October 17, our mainline fuel price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2016 is $1.59 to $1.64 per gallon while our regional fuel forecast for the fourth quarter is $1.65 to $1.70.  Despite these higher fuel prices, we expect the full year 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decreased by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give, we expect our fourth quarter pretax margin excluding special items to be between 4% and 6%. 
For our capital expenditures, we still expect total gross CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in 2016. We have 20 deliveries with approximately $1.1 billion, which will occur in the fourth quarter, and we expect to invest $300 million in non-aircraft CapEx in the quarter, which is $1.2 billion for the full year, which includes continued integration work and investments to improve our product and operations, some that Doug referred to his comments. 
Looking now to 2017, we are taking a disciplined approach to matching our plant capacity levels with anticipated levels of command. We're still in the process of developing our operating plan so our formal capacity guidance will come out when we report fourth quarter earnings. But we currently expect our year-over-year system capacity to be up approximately 1% in 2017. 
We expect full year 2017 domestic capacity to be flat while our international capacity is expected to be up approximately 3.5%. 
Our international growth is driven primarily by our Pacific entity as we annualized the new routes added in 2016. 
We'll also know more about 2017 unit cost projections after we complete our operating plan, but as Doug noted, we now have the bulk of our cost increases behind us. As we look to 2017, we expect the fully impact of our labor agreements with add approximately 2 points of CASM. But otherwise our core CASM growth should be around 2% on a very modest 1% growth in ASMs. 
And as Doug also noted with the integration nearing completion, we will be able to begin the process of eliminating some redundancies in 2017, which will help our unit cost in 2018 and beyond. 
So in conclusion, we couldn't be more proud of more than 100,000 team members who continue to deliver outstanding results. We continue to make great progress integrating our airlines most recently with our flight operating system cut over, and we've already seen some positive results. 
We're are also excited about the commercial initiatives our team is working on and looking forward to reporting on their continued success of future calls. 
Thanks, again, for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert."

I'd like to start out by thanking our 100,000 team members for their outstanding work during the quarter. And I'd characterized this quarter as being one of operational and commercial challenges. But I would like to underscore positively that we have executed integration items exceptionally well. 
Now despite all these challenges, our team's commitment to taking care for customers and each other has never wavered. 
Some of our performance was challenging for both our employees and customers. The primary driver was inclement weather that seem to settle over a number of our hubs thought the summer most notably Dallas or DFW. 
In addition, we struggled operate our expanded Los Angeles schedule reliably, primarily due to airport and facility constraints. 
We're working with Wawa so that we will be better able to meet our customers demand to fly American from Los Angeles going forward. 
I'm happy to report that our reliability has rebounded to near record levels across our system in September as a result of a number of factors and those trends have continued well into October and we expect that they will continue. 
Again, I appreciate the efforts of our frontline think team to take care for customers throughout the summer and especially and most recently during Hurricane Matthew. 
We have successfully completed some major integration milestones over the past few months, including a single flight operating system for our pilots, dispatch and aircraft. 
And I so appreciative of our 15,000 pilots, the APA, our IT and flight off teams for their efforts to ensure a seamless cutover. 
We've also put new uniforms on all of our employees. We have interim agreements with our fleet service and mechanic workgroups, tentative agreements now with our flight crew training instructors and sim engineers and once these tentative agreements have been ratified, all American team members will be benefiting from pay increases that resulted from our merger. 
So much of what we're striving to accomplish going forward will be difficult to address without having the integration work completed and completed well. 
As we start to think about our plans for next year, there's good reason to believe that American will improve versus the industry and operations performance. We're taking a fresh look at how we schedule our aircraft reliability. Our 777-200 reconfigurations will be completed by December 2017. Our 787 fleet has reached a critical mass allowing for easier recovery from our schedule ops and with the single flight operating system, our aircraft and pilots can now be used interchangeably instead of being managed as separate entities. 
We're also making big investments in service recovery and customer notification tools for passengers and employees that will continue to rollout next year. 
On the revenue front, our third quarter PRASM was down 2.2% while the revenue environment is still challenging in certain areas of the world, we have absorbed improvements in many places. The third quarter was much better than the second quarter, so we continue to see improving trends. As Doug noted, in September, we had positive year-over-year CASM and PRASM, and that's the first time this has occurred since November of 2014. 
And we're seeing improving trends in cargo as well. September marked the first time since December 2014 that our monthly year-over-year cargo revenue has improved. 
Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 1.8%. This was our best result since the first quarter of 2015. We saw strength across the board with all hubs having second derivative improvements.  Los Angeles and DCA were top performers year-over-year. 
Internationally, we have lapped the dollar strengthening last year as well as declining international surcharges. Latin was our first entity to turn positive with PRASM up 1.8% for the quarter, driven by a 25% year-over-year improvement in Brazil PRASM as capacity rationalize and the real strengthened. 
In addition, there was continued strength in Mexico. 
The Atlantic was our worst-performing international entity down 11.2%. The main drivers of performance are continued capacity increases, specifically from low-cost carriers, the devaluation of British pound as a result of the Brexit vote and lingering impact from recent terrorist attacks. 
Costa Pacific, PRASM was down 10.5% and capacity increases of 28.7% with continued weakness in China due to excess capacity and growing into our new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Haneda, Sydney and Oakland. 
We're pleased to see corporate passenger demand holding up, driven by our domestic entity. In the third quarter, we saw increases in both absolutely revenue and revenue share, and we see similar trends is helping in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, we see some choppiness in the fourth quarter due to holiday shifts with September and January benefiting from traffic shifting from October and December. We expect November to be the strongest month in the quarter versus 2015. 
Regionally, the domestic fourth quarter looks about the same as the third quarter due to holidays shifts. 
In Latin America, we expect continued sequential improvements and low single digit increases in PRASM. We expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with low double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. And with that, we expect our fourth quarter RASM, not PRASM, but total RASM to be down 1% to 3% year-over-year. We expected our fourth quarter declined to be smaller than our third quarter decline despite a more difficult fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. 
As we look forward to 2017, we expect continued second derivative improvement in year-over-year PRASM performance and look forward to getting positive PRASM in the first half of the year. 
In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at American Airlines. We made a tremendous amount of progress over this past year with respect to integration, operational improvement and getting back on positive PRASM. All of these important steps are critical to restoring American Airlines through its rightful industry-leading position. We have a lot of work left to do, but are confident that the right plans, the right team in place to execute, and we look forward to reporting back on future successes. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin the question-and-answer session."

So Derek can provide details. But first off, I would -- frankly, we don't  agree with the premise and shareholders can make their own decisions obviously based upon what we do, but our view is the best thing for our shareholders is to ensure that we have sufficient amount of liquidity to withstand any sort of downturn, but the cost of getting of worrying about credit ratings is in a business where we're borrowing against aircraft of 3% doesn't necessarily actually doesn't seem to be -- that goal in of itself doesn't seem to be in our shareholders' best interest. So somewhat, it's somewhat surprised with shareholder -- with people like you who push back on this because we think we're doing our best for our shareholders. And at the end of the day, we're producing -- we are producing profits at levels this industry has never seen before but gives us with other industries do. We're very bullish in our ability to continue doing that over time. As we do so, the first thing we do is invest back in our company. This company needs a good bit of investments. We're investing at levels that no airlines have ever invested before. The aircraft modernization I talked about has now -- that aircraft levels with their -- at age levels that are well below our competitors, something like around 10 years and falling for us in 16, 17 years and increasing for them. And then investing -- on top of that, something as Derek said, $1.5 billion next year on improvements in the airlines.  Those are good investments, and we're excited about that. And those will provide reassurance for our shareholders. Those are long-lived assets. We're not of spending on ancillary businesses or trying to do something we're not. We're doing what we think is right, and we feel very good about that. That investment now returns for shareholders. Once we do that, then we look to make sure we pay down any high-cost debt, we've done. Derek and his team have done a phenomenal job of getting to what we have larger amount of debt on the balance sheet than it appears. The cost of that debt is low. And as we look to each -- the incremental decision by the way, comes down to that, we're adding airplanes as we do modernization. Should we use all of our cash balance to pay for those aircrafts or should we avail ourselves of the 3% debt. And we think the best thing for our shareholders is to avail of the 3% debt. That leaves us with cash balances that are in excess of the target and we what we do with that is to return to our shareholders. But the way we protect ourselves is having a much higher liquidity balance than others. That's the cost of it, but it's a much less costly thing done paying -- than not availing yourself of low cost debt. I mean, the other point I make is, even if we did those things, even if we started paying cash for aircraft, we still have higher debt because we have better assets. When you have airplanes that are 9 years old versus someone else's 17 years, you're going to have higher debt because you have much better assets and they're going to be here for a long time. That's why we're doing this. So [indiscernible]. This is we believe in the right spot. We're very comfortable with our leverage. We're very comfortable with our balance sheet, and we're doing the right thing for shareholders."

You'll see on the cost front, as Derek noted, the reason the margins declined even though we're having better RASM right now, of course, is our CASM is more. That's because we're going to taking care of our people faster and gotten ourselves to a point where we have in every work group less than 3 years since the merger we now have everyone on new pay scales that reflect the job they're doing for us, and that increased our cost level but [indiscernible] level off.

So I think what we want to do is, we're going to go through the budget in '17, we're going to see where everything is and then try to work with each one of the teams to figure out how we take that out over the time period into '18. But I think it's more -- as we talked about, an '18 issue than it is an '17 issue. Mostly it's inefficiencies of trying to run 2 different airlines all throughout the company. It's not just one point, it's all throughout the company as we've tried to get ourselves where we want to be from an airline and running the best airline we can."

And thanks for bringing it back because I know when I said it, we're comfortable. What I meant was we're comfortable where it is at this time because looking to the future, what we expect just those metrics continue to improve. I want to try to suggest we're comfortable of keeping them, although we may be. But the reason we're comfortable with them at this time is because of what you say, we have very good line of sight as to what our capital requirements are going forward. We have a very -- we have -- we feel good about our -- certainly even on a very -- in difficult economic times those, stress testing, I guess, even things like recession about what our earnings would do. As we go forward. So those -- that gives us comfort that we are in a good spot right now and when things come up like 3% interest, it seems to be an absolute no-brainer to us that the right thing to do is to take those debt on rather than using cash to pay airplanes and use that cash for [indiscernible]. So that's what we're comfortable about. What happens over time, I would expect and again, without giving the targets is you will see certainly that the metrics that are tied coverage ratios, for example, high earnings to debt levels, you see those get for overtime, and you get better as our earnings get better and the debt gets lower, we are also, I should note, while we're well ahead of everyone in terms of modernizing our fleet, there will come a time that we've got gotten that done in the future, and you will see the debt continue to come out at these levels. So as debt gets lower overtime and earnings continue -- EBITDA  or margin starts to stay where they are, you'll see those numbers get better. And that's what why we're comfortable where we are today. I think where we are today because of the reasons I said and believe we have the right structure in place. As insurance we carry a lot more cash than others, but we think that's the better way to do for our shareholders than to go and pay cash for airplanes rather taking a 3% data."

But it's noteworthy, particularly when we get to conversations about relative debt levels to point out how much stronger our asset base is my only point. And the best way for me to communicate that to you is to point out how much younger our fleet is. Look, it is it's absolutely a customer advantage when you get one embarked new airplanes as one that is no doubt that it is a much better in-flight product, and you can tell the difference. So we feel good about that. But you're right, the orders were in place and are coming, and we're taking them. But the bigger point I'm trying to make here is these are, if you look in the very near term, you may say, oh my gosh, these guys -- they have all these debt. These are 25-year assets and those airlines have 17-year-old airplanes won't be able to have 42-year-old airplanes 25 years from now. So at some point, my point is we ahead of them and suggesting they need to go, spend enormous amount of capital in the very near term, but they will need to do something, and we won't have too at that point in time, that's way it works. So anyway our goal is to make sure we have the absolute [indiscernible] it's nice when you're in that position.

So in terms of this summer and the fall, that's really where I look at things and its associated with schedule where I think quite frankly, we're pretty aggressive in terms of the schedule that we put out this summer. We had issues in Los Angeles. We definitely had, I think, an order of that amount weather issues associated with DFW and then Charlotte and Miami, and that was pragmatic. So seems like we're in a recovery phase a lot of during the summer. As I said before we have a lot of integration tools that we didn't have that we will have in the future and that is on building the airline back after disruption and making sure our customers and their baggage is taken care of. One of the things you'll note though is that we continue to be really strong in terms of our departing on time performance, the [indiscernible] performance. That is something that we'll continue to see and I think that they'll will translate into more competitive arrivals within 14 performance. And you'll see as well, that our completion factor as we move from operating 2 systems and really 3 systems in regard to our pilot down to one that we've got a chance to do much, much better. So I'm very optimistic of where we're headed and if you take a look at where we're at right now, schedule reduction associated with the fall season with changes to our Los Angeles operation, we're operating back at near record levels and that should continue and again, as I said before all efforts are focused on making sure that we work together to put out a schedule in 2017 that we can operate reliably and competitively with the best in the business."

As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call with Doug and he will provide an overview of the third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder -- for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media. 
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

Pretax earnings, excluding special items of $1.5 billion. It's down from last year's $1.9 billion. But that's due both by declining unit revenues, our total -- our TRASM was down 2.2% versus last year. And increasing year cost, driven primarily by investments on our team. But while they're down, they're still the second best third quarter in history in American Airlines behind only the third quarter 2015. 
Also because of our share repurchase activity, our adjusted EPS was actually up, even though earnings were down from $2.77 up to $2.80 in the quarter. 
So these results are due to the fantastic team at American who've done an amazing job for our customers. We're extremely grateful for them and what they do. 
On the revenue front, Robert will provide a lot more detail, but we're encouraged by the trends. Our TRASM, as I said, was down 2.2% in the third quarter. But that's better than we've seen in terms of the decline in recent quarters. And it's better than our competitors are experiencing. In fact, our -- the month of September TRASM was actually improved year-over-year, which was the first month of year-over-year TRASM improvement for American Airlines since November of 2014. Now of course, September was helped by the calendar on a year-over-year basis, which is why we at American would like to focus much on monthly unit revenue numbers. But the trend is good and it appears to be continuing, as Robert will discuss. 
Our unit costs grew in the quarter and Derek will talk -- will provide more detail on that. But the primary driver of the unit cost increase is our decision to invest in our seats. We have pay increases and profit sharing that are, by far, the largest drivers of the cost increase. and we're pleased to be able to provide those improvements to our team members. We've now reached new agreements with all of our work groups, so the large increases are behind us. 
Furthermore, as we complete more of our integration in 2017, we'll be able to begin eliminating some of the redundancies that still exist because of the 2 airlines, and that'll help us reduce expenses in 2018 and beyond. 
As integration, we had an enormous success earlier this month with the flawless integration of our flight operating system across. This is an extremely complicated system integration that's led to operational disruptions with other airlines as they've gone through mergers. And our team executed it without it -- without a hitch. 
While we're doing all that, we continue to invest in our products and improve the product. We had 12 new aircraft as part of our unprecedented fleet renewal program in the [indiscernible]. American's fleet is now more than 40% younger than our large network peers and that gap is widening. 
We had 10 new destinations to our network, including 5 in Cuba, a new service to -- from LAX to Hong Kong. And next month, we'll begin daily flights to Havana, strengthening our position as the largest carrier to Cuba. 
We continue to make enormous improvements to our clubs, including in this quarter, the reopening of a renovated Admirals Club in Rio de Janeiro and the refurbishment of our London Heathrow Arrivals Club, which now has 29 shower rooms and a business center. 
So in summary, this -- the U.S. airline industry have been transformed and American Airlines is well positioned for success in the New World. We're producing record profits -- near record profits despite a soft economic environment, and we're using those profits to improve customer service through important investments in both our products and our team. And we're returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
There's much work ahead, but the American team continues to improve [indiscernible] challenge. We're extremely pleased with where we are and very bullish on the future of American Airlines. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Derek, who will provide more details on the financial results. And then to our recently appointed President, Robert Isom, who will discuss operating performance and revenue environment. Derek?"

Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We've filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning.

We've filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $737 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This compares to our third quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.49 per diluted share. And if we exclude the special charges, we reported a net profit of $933 million in the third quarter of 2016 or $1.76 per diluted share versus the third quarter net profit of $1.9 billion in 2015 or $2.77 per diluted share. 
Our GAAP third quarter pretax profit was $1.2 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 11.2%. Excluding special charges, our third quarter pretax profit was $1.5 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 14%. Excluding the effects of special charges and the noncash tax provision of $449 million, our third quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.80 per share compared to $2.77 in the third quarter of 2015, reflecting a 22% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the quarter. 
We continue to see sequential improvement in the revenue environment during the quarter, which Robert will talk more about. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.6 billion, down 1.1% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9.1 billion, down 2.2%, driven by a 0.6% decline in yields. Cargoes were -- cargo revenues were down 5.1% to $171 million due primarily to a decline in international and domestic yields. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 8.5% versus the same period last year due to the impact of the new credit card deal signed with Barclays U.S., Citi and MasterCard on July 12, 2016. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $9.2 billion, up 5.2% versus the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in our people through contractual increases and the introduction of profit sharing plan, investments in our product, investment, which includes our fleet, as Doug talked about, and investments in our operation. These investments were offset in part by lower fuel costs. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the third quarter of 2016, was down 12.4% year-over-year to $1.46 per gallon. 
Third quarter mainline cost per ASM was $0.1196, up 5.6% year-over-year. Excluding special charges in fuel, our mainline CASM was $0.0932, up 8.9% year-over-year. Regional operating cost per ASM in the third quarter was $0.1885, which was down 5.2% from the third quarter in 2015. Excluding special charges in fuel, regional CASM was $0.1508, a decrease of 4.4% due to the continued shift to more efficient large regional jets. 
We entered the third quarter of 2016 with approximately $9.2 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.8 billion and $2.4 billion in an undrawn revolver capacity well in the excess -- well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimal liquidity we seek to maintain for this foreseeable future. The company also had $635 million classified as restricted cash during the quarter. 
We did generate $1.1 billion during the quarter of cash flow from operations and made $372 million in debt payments. We continue to believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program, which will be substantially complete in 2017. 
During the quarter, the company took advantage of favorable market conditions and completed several financing transactions, including a repricing of the company's 2014 term loan collateralized by our London Heathrow slots, which reduced interest by 25 basis points and the issuance of $814 million EETC consisting of
[Audio Gap]
Shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share of distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 31% from 756 million at merger close in December 2013 to 519.2 million shares on September 30, 2016. At the end of the third quarter 2016, the company had approximately $555 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. We continue to monitor our capacity plans. And in our IR update issued last week, we lowered full year 2016 system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 1.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline capacity to be 57.5 billion ASMs and our regional capacity to be 7.84 billion ASMs. So our consolidated capacity will be flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, to be up approximately 5% to 7% while regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to be up between 8% and 10%. This year-over-year increase is driven primarily by investment in our people of about 6 points, maintenance timing of 2 points and D&A from new aircraft and increased CapEx of 1 point. Regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is expected to be down by approximately 3% to 5% in the same period. 
As we look forward for the first time since mid-2014, year-over-year fuel prices are expected to be higher through the remainder of the year. Based on the forward curve as of October 17, our mainline fuel price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2016 is $1.59 to $1.64 per gallon, while our regional fuel forecast for the fourth quarter is $1.65 to $1.70. Despite these higher fuel prices, we expect the full year 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give, we expect our fourth quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 4% and 6%. 
For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in 2016. We have 20 deliveries worth approximately $1.1 billion, which will occur in the fourth quarter. And we expect to invest $300 million in non-aircraft CapEx in the quarter, which is $1.2 billion for the full year, which includes continued integration work and investments to improve our product and operations, some that Doug referred to in his comments. 
Looking now to 2017. We are taking a disciplined approach to matching our planned capacity levels with anticipated levels of demand. We are still in the process of developing our operating plan, so our formal capacity guidance will come out when we report fourth quarter earnings. But we currently expect our year-over-year system capacity to be up approximately 1% in 2017. We expect full year 2017 domestic capacity to be flat, while our international capacity is expected to be up approximately 3.5%. Our international growth is driven primarily by our Pacific entity as we annualize the new routes added in 2016. 
We'll also know more about our 2017 unit cost projections after we complete our operating plan, but as Doug noted, we now have the bulk of our cost increases behind us. As we look to 2017, we expect the full year impact of our labor agreements will add approximately 2 points of CASM. But otherwise, our core CASM growth should be around 2% on a very modest 1% growth in ASMs. And as Doug also noted, with the integration nearing completion, we will be able to begin the process of eliminating some redundancies in 2017, which will help our unit cost in 2018 and beyond. 
So in conclusion, we couldn't be more proud of more than 100,000 team members who continue to deliver outstanding results. We continue to make great progress integrating our airlines most recently with our flight operating system cut over, and we've already seen some positive results. We are also excited about the commercial initiatives our team is working on and looking forward to reporting on their continued success on future calls. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert."

I'd like to start out by thanking our 100,000 team members for their outstanding work during the quarter. And I'd characterized this quarter as being one of operational and commercial challenges. But I would like to underscore positively that we have executed integration items exceptionally well. despite all these challenges, our team's commitment to taking care of our customers and each other has never wavered. 
Summer ops performance was challenging for both our employees and customers. The primary driver was inclement weather that seemed to settle over a number of our hubs throughout the summer, most notably Dallas, or DFW. in addition, we struggled to operate our expanded Los Angeles schedule reliably, primarily due to airport and facility constraints. We're working with LAWA, so that we will be better able to meet our customers' demands to fly American from Los Angeles going forward. 
I'm happy to report that our reliability has rebounded to near-record levels across our system in September as a result of a number of factors, and those trends have continued well into October. And we expect that they will continue. 
Again, I appreciate the efforts of our frontline team to take care for customers throughout the summer and especially, and most recently, during Hurricane Matthew. 
We have successfully completed some major integration milestones over the past few months, including a single-flight operating system for our pilots, dispatch and aircraft. And I'm so appreciative of our 15,000 pilots, the APA, our IT and flight ops teams for their efforts to ensure a seamless cutover. 
We've also put new uniforms on all of our employees. We have interim agreements with our fleet service and mechanic workgroups, tentative agreements now with our flight crew training instructors and SIM engineers. And once these tentative agreements have been ratified, all American team members will be benefiting from pay increases that resulted from our merger. So much of what we're striving to accomplish going forward would be difficult to address without having the integration work completed and completed well. 
As we start to think about our plans for next year, there's good reason to believe that American will improve versus the industry in operations performance. We're taking a fresh look at how we schedule our aircraft reliability. Our 777-200 reconfigurations will be completed by December 2017. Our 787 fleet has reached a critical mass, allowing for easier recovery from off-scheduled ops. And with the single-flight operating system, our aircraft and pilots can now be used interchangeably instead of being managed as separate entities. We're also making big investments in service recovery and customer notification tools for passengers and employees that will continue to rollout next year. 
On the revenue front, our third quarter TRASM was down 2.2%. While the revenue environment is still challenging in certain areas of the world, we have observed improvements in many places. Third -- the third quarter was much better than the second quarter, so we continue to see improving trends. As Doug noted, in September, we had positive year-over-year TRASM and PRASM, and that's the first time this has occurred since November of 2014. And we're seeing improving trends in cargo as well. September marked the first time since December 2014 that our monthly year-over-year cargo revenue has improved. 
Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 1.8%. This was our best result since the first quarter of 2015. We saw strength across the board with all hubs having second derivative improvements.  Los Angeles and DCA were top performers year-over-year. 
Internationally, we have lapped the dollar strengthening last year as well as declining international surcharges. Lat-Am was our first entity to turn positive with PRASM up 1.8% for the quarter, driven by a 25% year-over-year improvement in Brazil PRASM as capacity rationalized and the real strengthened. In addition, there was continued strength in Mexico. 
The Atlantic was our worst-performing international entity, down 11.2%. The main drivers of performance are continued capacity increases, specifically from low-cost carriers, the devaluation of the British pound as a result of the Brexit vote and lingering impacts from recent terrorist attacks. 
Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10.5% and capacity increases of 28.7% with continued weakness in China due to excess capacity and growing into our new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Haneda, Sydney and Auckland. 
We're pleased to see corporate passenger demand holding up, driven by our domestic entity. In the third quarter, we saw increases in both absolute revenue and revenue share. And we see similar trends developing in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, we see some choppiness in the fourth quarter due to holiday shifts with September and January benefiting from traffic shifting from October and December. We expect November to be the strongest month in the quarter versus 2015. 
Regionally, the domestic fourth quarter looks about the same as the third quarter due to holidays shifts. 
In Latin America, we expect continued sequential improvement and low single digit increases in PRASM. We expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with low double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. With that, we expect our fourth quarter TRASM, not PRASM, but total RASM to be down 1% to 3% year-over-year. We expect that our fourth quarter decline to be smaller than our third quarter decline despite a more difficult fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. As we look forward to 2017, we expect continued second derivative improvement in year-over-year TRASM performance and look forward to getting to positive TRASM in the first half of the year. 
In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at American Airlines. We've made a tremendous amount of progress over this past year with respect to integration, operational improvement and getting back on to positive TRASM. All of these important steps are critical to restoring American Airlines to its rightful industry-leading position. We have a lot of work left to do, but we're confident we have the right plans, the right team in place to execute, and we look forward to reporting back on future successes. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin the question-and-answer session."

But first off, I would just -- I -- frankly, we don't  agree with the premise and shareholders can make their own decisions obviously based upon what we do. But our view is the best thing for our shareholders, is to ensure that we have a sufficient amount of liquidity to withstand any sort of downturn. But the cost of getting to -- of worrying about credit ratings is in a business where we can -- we're borrowing against aircraft of 3%. It doesn't necessarily -- actually, it doesn't seem to be -- that goal, in and of itself, doesn't seem to be in our shareholders' best interest. So somewhat -- it's somewhat surprised with shareholder -- with people like you who'd push back on this [indiscernible] year's out because we think we're doing what's best for our shareholders. At the end of the day, we're producing -- we are producing profits at levels we've -- this industry has never seen before, but consistent with what other industries do. We're very bullish on our ability to continue doing that over time. As we do so, the first thing we do is invest back in our company. This company needs a good bit of investments. We're investing at levels that no airlines ever invested before. The aircraft modernization I talked about has now at aircraft levels that are  -- at age levels that are well below our competitors, something like around 10 years and falling for us in 16, 17 years and increasing for them. And then investing -- on top of that, it's something as Derek said, $1.5 billion next year on improvements in the airlines. That's -- those are good investments, and we're excited about those. And those will provide return shares to our shareholders. Those are long-lived assets. They're -- we're not off spending it on ancillary businesses or trying to do something we're not. We're doing what we think is right, and we feel very good about that. That investment now returns to shareholders. Once we do that, then we look to make sure we've paid down any high-end cost debt. We've done that. Derek and his team have done a phenomenal job of getting to while we have a larger amount of debt on the balance sheet than it appears. The cost of that debt is low. And as we look to each -- the incremental decision, by the way, comes down to that. We're adding airplanes as we do this modernization, should we use some of our cash balance to pay for those aircraft or should we avail ourselves of the 3% debt. And we think the best thing for our shareholders is to avail ourselves of the 3% debt. That leaves us with cash balances that are in excess of the target. And we think the right thing to do with that is to return to our shareholders. But the way we protect ourselves is having a much higher liquidity balance than others. That's the cost of it, but it's a much less costly thing than paying -- than not availing yourself a low-cost debt. I mean, the other point I want to make is, even if we did those things, even if we started paying cash for aircraft, we still have higher debt. It's because we have better assets. When you have airplanes that are 9 years old versus someone else's 17 years, you're going to have higher debt because you have much better assets. And they're going to be here for a long time. As are we -- and that's why we're doing this. So Saudi Arabia, this is -- we believe we're in the right spot. We're very comfortable with our leverage. We're very comfortable with our balance sheet. And we're doing the right thing for our shareholders."

You're seeing it already in the RASM, and that will continue into '17. You'll see on the cost front, as Derek noted, we -- the reason the margins declined even though we're having better RASM right now, of course, is because our CASM is up more. That's because we've gone in taking care of our people faster and gotten ourselves to a point where we have, in every work group, less than 3 years since the merger, we now have everyone on new pay scales that reflect the job they're doing for us, and that's increased our cost, but [indiscernible] they're well below. We had to do that. We're happy we did that. Our shareholders should be happy we did that. But it's behind us now. We have one of those that was done mid-year, which is the TWIM, as Derek talked about, so that will have a year-over-year impact, but it's in the current cost structure. And beyond that, we'll be able to see any sort of other cost increase certainly over and above kind of inflationary rates in the airline. So I think what you'll see, as we go through '17, is better revenue per ASM improvement on year-over-year basis and better cost performance as well."

The one game-changer, maybe a big stretch of the work, but actually, certainly an improvement in how we can do that and still not -- and still be as good for American Airlines as it can be is basic economy. And so that product we have in place will allow us to do just that, but not have the same amount of dilution we have to American Airlines.

And I also will tell you that based on what we think about the future, we're extremely bullish on the American stock, which is why we continue to purchase at the levels we do, because as we look out, targets are known targets, our projections even in difficult economic environments have this company be nice and profitable, and it doesn't feel like our stock reflects that.

So we all know absolute debt levels are higher than they've been historically. But with respect to the underlying business, I wonder if you could just help investors understand the leverage metrics relative to where they've been historically, maybe on an American standalone basis. So leverage metrics today relative to some average over some period of time that makes sense.

And thanks for bringing me back because I know when I said it, we're comfortable. What I meant was we're comfortable with where it is at this time, because looking to the future what we expect is you'll see those metrics continue to improve. I want to try and suggest we're comfortable in keeping them exactly where they are, although we may be. But the reason we're comfortable with them at this time is because of what you say, we have very good line of sight as to what our capital requirements are going forward. We have a very -- we have -- we feel good about our -- certainly, even on a very -- in difficult economic times, stress testing, I guess, even things like recession about what our earnings would do as we go forward. So those -- that gives us comfort that we are in a good spot right now and when things come up like 3% interest, it seems to be an absolute no-brainer to us that the right thing to do is to take those debts on rather than using cash to pay airplanes and to use that cash for better purposes. So that's where we're comfortable about. What happens over time, I would expect and again, without giving the targets, is you will see, certainly, that the metrics that are tied, the coverage ratios, for example, tie earnings to debt levels, you'll see those get better over time, and the earnings get better. And as earnings get better and the debt gets lower, we are also, I should note, while we're well ahead of everyone in terms of modernizing our fleet, there will come a time that we've got gotten that done in the not too distant, and you won't see the debt continue to come out at these levels. So as debt gets lower overtime and earnings continue, and EBITDA or margins set or stay where they are, you'll see those numbers get better. And that's why we're comfortable with where we are today. We are comfortable where we are today because of the reasons I said and believe we have the right structure in place. As insurance, we carry a lot more cash than others. But we think that's the better way to do this for our shareholders than to go and pay cash for airplanes rather taking a 3% debt."

But we don't have a goal to say, we need to be below the others in aircraft age. But it's noteworthy, particularly when we get to conversations about relative debt levels to point out how much stronger our asset base is my only point. And the best way for me to communicate that to you is to point out how much younger our fleet is. Look, it is absolutely a customer advantage, when you get one [indiscernible] new airplanes, there is one of of our other airplanes, there is no doubt that it is a much better in-flight product and you can tell the difference. So we feel good about that. But you're right, the orders were in place and they're coming, and we're taking them. But the bigger point I'm trying to make here is these are -- if you look in the very near term, you may say, oh my gosh, these guys -- they have all these debt. These are 25-year assets, and those airlines that have 17-year-old airplanes won't be able to have 42-year-old airplanes 25 years from now. So at some point -- my point is we're ahead of them, and I'm suggesting they need to go, spend enormous amount of capital in the very near term, but they will need to do something, and we won't have to at that point in time, that's way that works. So anyway our goal is to make sure we have the absolute youngest, it's nice when you're in that position. But to the extent you want to look at relative debt levels, you need to look at the asset base, and our asset base is just worth tremendously more than what theirs are."

We're performing very well, as I said, in my remarks with our corporate business. So in terms of this summer and the fall, that's really where I look at things and it is associated with the schedule where I think we -- just quite frankly, we're pretty aggressive in terms of the schedule that we put out this summer. We had issues in Los Angeles. We definitely had, I think, an inordinate amount of weather issues associated with DFW and then Charlotte and Miami, and that was problematic. So it seems like we're in a recovery phase a lot of during the summer. As I said before, we have a lot of integration tools that we didn't have, but we will have in the future and that is on building the airline back after disruption and making sure our customers and their baggage is taken care of. One of the things you'll note though is that we continue to be really strong in terms of our departing on time performance, the D0 performance. That's something that we'll continue to see. And I think that, that will translate into more competitive arrivals within 14 performance. And you'll see as well, that in our completion factor as we move from operating 2 systems and really 3 systems in regard to our pilots down to 1, that we've got a chance to do much, much better. So I'm very optimistic of where we're headed. And if you take a look at where we're at right now, schedule reduction associated with the fall season with changes to our Los Angeles operation, we're operating back at near record levels and that should continue. And again, as I said before all efforts are focused on making sure that we work together to put out a schedule in 2017 that we can operate reliably and competitively with the best in the business."

There are a lot of restrictions that are still in place that have made it difficult to sell.

As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call with Doug and he will provide an overview of the third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder -- for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media. 
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

Pretax earnings, excluding special items of $1.5 billion. It's down from last year's $1.9 billion. But that's driven both by declining unit revenues, our total -- our TRASM was down 2.2% versus last year. And increasing year cost, driven primarily by investments in our team. But while they're down, they're still the second best third quarter in the history of American Airlines behind only the third quarter 2015. 
Also because of our share repurchase activity, our adjusted EPS was actually up, even though earnings were down from $2.77 up to $2.80 in the quarter. 
So these results are due to the fantastic team at American who've done an amazing job for our customers. Every day we're extremely grateful for them and what they do. 
On the revenue front, Robert will provide a lot more detail, but we're encouraged by the trends. Our TRASM, as I said, was down 2.2% in the third quarter. But that's better than we've seen in terms of the decline in recent quarters. And it's better than our competitors are experiencing. In fact, our -- the month of September TRASM was actually improved year-over-year, which was the first month of year-over-year TRASM improvement for American Airlines since November 2014. Now of course, September was helped by the calendar on a year-over-year basis, which is why we at American don't really like to focus much on monthly unit revenue numbers. But the trend is good and it appears to be continuing, as Robert will discuss. 
Our unit costs grew in the quarter and Derek will talk -- will provide more detail on that. But the primary driver of the unit cost increase is our decision to invest in our seat. We have pay increases and profit sharing that are, by far, the largest drivers of the cost increase. and we're pleased to be able to provide those improvements to our team members. We've now reached new agreements with all of our work groups, so the large increases are behind us. 
Furthermore, as we complete more of our integration in 2017, we'll be able to begin eliminating some of the redundancies that still exist because of 2 airlines, and that'll help us reduce expenses in 2018 and beyond. 
As integration, we had an enormous success earlier this month with the flawless integration of our flight operating system or FOS. This is an extremely complicated system integration that's led to operational disruptions with other airlines as they've gone through mergers. And our team executed it without it -- without a hitch. 
While we're doing all that, we continue to invest in the product and improve the product. We had 12 new aircraft as part of our unprecedented fleet renewal program import. American's fleet is now more than 40% younger than our large network peers and that gap is widening. 
We added 10 new destinations to our network, including 5 in Cuba, a new service to -- from LAX to Hong Kong. And next month, we'll begin daily flights to Havana, cementing our position as the largest carrier to Cuba. 
We continue to make enormous improvements to our clubs, including in this quarter, the reopening of a renovated Admirals Club in Rio de Janeiro and the refurbishment of our London Heathrow Arrivals Club, which now has 29 shower rooms and a business center. 
So in summary, this -- the U.S. airline industry has been transformed and American Airlines is well positioned for success in the new world. We're producing record profits -- near record profits despite a soft economic environment, and we're using those profits to improve customer service through important investments in both our products and our team. And we're returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
Though there's much work ahead, but the American team continues to improve [indiscernible] challenge. We're extremely pleased with where we are and very bullish on the future of American Airlines. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Derek, who will provide more details on the financial results. And then to our recently appointed President, Robert Isom, who will discuss operating performance and revenue environment. Derek?"

Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We've filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning.

We've filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $737 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This compares to our third quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.49 per diluted share. And if we exclude the special charges, we reported a net profit of $933 million in the third quarter of 2016 or $1.76 per diluted share versus the third quarter net profit of $1.9 billion in 2015 or $2.77 per diluted share. 
Our GAAP third quarter pretax profit was $1.2 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 11.2%. Excluding special charges, our third quarter pretax profit was $1.5 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 14%. Excluding the effects of special charges and the noncash tax provision of $449 million, our third quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.80 per share compared to $2.77 in the third quarter of 2015, reflecting a 22% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the quarter. 
We continue to see sequential improvement in the revenue environment during the quarter, which Robert will talk more about. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.6 billion, down 1.1% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9.1 billion, down 2.2%, driven by a 0.6% decline in yields. Cargoes were -- cargo revenues were down 5.1% to $171 million due primarily to a decline in international and domestic yields. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 8.5% versus the same period last year due to the impact of the new credit card deal signed with Barclays U.S., Citi and MasterCard on July 12, 2016. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $9.2 billion, up 5.2% versus the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in our people through contractual increases and the introduction of profit sharing plan, investments in our product, investment which includes our fleet, as Doug talked about, and investments in our operation. These investments were offset in part by lower fuel costs. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the third quarter of 2016, was down 12.4% year-over-year to $1.46 per gallon. 
Third quarter mainline cost per ASM was $0.1196, up 5.6% year-over-year. Excluding special charges in fuel, our mainline CASM was $0.0932, up 8.9% year-over-year. Regional operating cost per ASM in the third quarter was $0.1885, which was down 5.2% from the third quarter in 2015. Excluding special charges in fuel, regional CASM was $0.1508, a decrease of 4.4% due to the continued shift to more efficient large regional jets. 
We entered the third quarter of 2016 with approximately $9.2 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.8 billion and $2.4 billion in an undrawn revolver capacity well in the excess -- well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimal liquidity we seek to maintain for this foreseeable future. The company also had $635 million classified as restricted cash during the quarter. 
We did generate $1.1 billion during the quarter of cash flow from operations and made $372 million in debt payments. We continue to believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program, which will be substantially complete in 2017. 
During the quarter, the company took advantage of favorable market conditions and completed several financing transactions, including a repricing of the company's 2014 term loan collateralized by our London Heathrow slots, which reduced interest by 25 basis points and the issuance of $814 million EETC consisting of
[Audio Gap]
Shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share of distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 31% from 756 million at merger close in December 2013 to 519.2 million shares on September 30, 2016. At the end of the third quarter 2016, the company had approximately $555 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. We continue to monitor our capacity plans. And in our IR update issued last week, we lowered full year 2016 system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 1.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline capacity to be 57.5 billion ASMs and our regional capacity to be 7.84 billion ASMs. So our consolidated capacity will be flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, to be up approximately 5% to 7% while regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to be up between 8% and 10%. This year-over-year increase is driven primarily by investment in our people of about 6 points, maintenance timing of 2 points and D&A from new aircraft and increased CapEx of 1 point. Regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is expected to be down by approximately 3% to 5% in the same period. 
As we look forward for the first time since mid-2014, year-over-year fuel prices are expected to be higher through the remainder of the year. Based on the forward curve as of October 17, our mainline fuel price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2016 is $1.59 to $1.64 per gallon, while our regional fuel forecast for the fourth quarter is $1.65 to $1.70. Despite these higher fuel prices, we expect our full year 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give, we expect our fourth quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 4% and 6%. 
For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in 2016. We have 20 deliveries worth approximately $1.1 billion, which will occur in the fourth quarter. And we expect to invest $300 million in non-aircraft CapEx in the quarter, which is $1.2 billion for the full year, which includes continued integration work and investments to improve our product and operations, some that Doug referred to in his comments. 
Looking out to 2017. We are taking a disciplined approach to matching our planned capacity levels with anticipated levels of demand. We are still in the process of developing our operating plan, so our formal capacity guidance will come out when we report fourth quarter earnings. But we currently expect our year-over-year system capacity to be up approximately 1% in 2017. We expect full year 2017 domestic capacity to be flat, while our international capacity is expected to be up approximately 3.5%. Our international growth is driven primarily by our Pacific entity as we annualize the new routes added in 2016. 
We'll also know more about our 2017 unit cost projections after we complete our operating plan, but as Doug noted, we now have the bulk of our cost increases behind us. As we look to 2017, we expect the full year impact of our labor agreements will add approximately 2 points of CASM. But otherwise, our core CASM growth should be around 2% on a very modest 1% growth in ASMs. And as Doug also noted, with the integration nearing completion, we will be able to begin the process of eliminating some redundancies in 2017, which will help our unit cost in 2018 and beyond. 
So in conclusion, we couldn't be more proud of more than 100,000 team members who continue to deliver outstanding results. We continue to make great progress integrating our airlines most recently with our flight operating system cut over, and we've already seen some positive results. We are also excited about the commercial initiatives our team is working on and looking forward to reporting on their continued success on future calls. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert."

I'd like to start out by thanking our 100,000 team members for their outstanding work during the quarter. And I'd characterized this quarter as being one of operational and commercial challenges. But I would like to underscore positively that we have executed integration items exceptionally well. Despite all these challenges, our team's commitment to taking care of our customers and each other has never wavered. 
Summer ops performance was challenging for both our employees and customers. The primary driver was inclement weather that seemed to settle over a number of our hubs throughout the summer, most notably Dallas, or DFW. in addition, we struggled to operate our expanded Los Angeles schedule reliably, primarily due to airport and facility constraints. We're working with LAWA, so that we will be better able to meet our customers' demands to fly American from Los Angeles going forward. 
I'm happy to report that our reliability has rebounded to near-record levels across our system in September as a result of a number of factors, and those trends have continued well into October. And we expect that they will continue. 
Again, I appreciate the efforts of our frontline team to take care of our customers throughout the summer and especially, and most recently, during Hurricane Matthew. 
We have successfully completed some major integration milestones over the past few months, including a single-flight operating system for our pilots, dispatch and aircraft. And I'm so appreciative of our 15,000 pilots, the APA, our IT and flight ops teams for their efforts to ensure a seamless cutover. 
We've also put new uniforms on all of our employees. We have interim agreements with our fleet service and mechanic workgroups, tentative agreements now with our flight crew training instructors and SIM engineers. And once these tentative agreements have been ratified, all American team members will be benefiting from pay increases that resulted from our merger. So much of what we're striving to accomplish going forward would be difficult to address without having the integration work completed and completed well. 
As we start to think about our plans for next year, there's good reason to believe that American will improve versus the industry in operations performance. We're taking a fresh look at how we schedule our aircraft for reliability. Our 777-200 reconfigurations will be completed by December 2017. Our 787 fleet has reached a critical mass, allowing for easier recovery from off-scheduled ops. And with the single-flight operating system, our aircraft and pilots can now be used interchangeably instead of being managed as separate entities. We're also making big investments in service recovery and customer notification tools for passengers and employees that will continue to roll out next year. 
On the revenue front, our third quarter TRASM was down 2.2%. While the revenue environment is still challenging in certain areas of the world, we have observed improvements in many places. Third -- the third quarter was much better than the second quarter, so we continue to see improving trends. As Doug noted, in September, we had positive year-over-year TRASM and PRASM, and that's the first time this has occurred since November 2014. And we're seeing improving trends in cargo as well. September marked the first time since December 2014 that our monthly year-over-year cargo revenue has improved. 
Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 1.8%. This was our best result since the first quarter of 2015. We saw strength across the board with all hubs having second derivative improvements. Los Angeles and DCA were top performers year-over-year. 
Internationally, we have lapped the dollar strengthening last year as well as declining international surcharges. LATAM was our first entity to turn positive with PRASM up 1.8% for the quarter, driven by a 25% year-over-year improvement in Brazil PRASM as capacity rationalized and the real strengthened. In addition, there was continued strength in Mexico. 
The Atlantic was our worst-performing international entity, down 11.2%. The main drivers of performance are continued capacity increases, specifically from low-cost carriers, the devaluation of the British pound as a result of the Brexit vote and lingering impacts from recent terrorist attacks. 
Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10.5% on capacity increases of 28.7% with continued weakness in China due to excess capacity and growing into our new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Haneda, Sydney and Auckland. 
We're pleased to see corporate passenger demand holding up, driven by our domestic entity. In the third quarter, we saw increases in both absolute revenue and revenue share. And we see similar trends developing in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, we see some choppiness in the fourth quarter due to holiday shifts with September and January benefiting from traffic shifting from October and December. We expect November to be the strongest month of the quarter versus 2015. 
Regionally, the domestic fourth quarter looks about the same as the third quarter due to holidays shifts. 
In Latin America, we expect continued sequential improvement and low single digit increases in PRASM. We expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with low double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. With that, we expect our fourth quarter TRASM, not PRASM, but total RASM to be down 1% to 3% year-over-year. We expect that our fourth quarter decline to be smaller than our third quarter decline despite a more difficult fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. As we look forward to 2017, we expect continued second derivative improvement in year-over-year TRASM performance and look forward to getting to positive TRASM in the first half of the year. 
In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at American Airlines. We've made a tremendous amount of progress over this past year with respect to integration, operational improvement and getting back on path to positive TRASM. All of these important steps are critical to restoring American Airlines to its rightful industry-leading position. We have a lot of work left to do, but we're confident we have the right plans, the right team in place to execute, and we look forward to reporting back on future successes. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin the question-and-answer session."

But you're running the risk of people sort of transitioning to more quality stocks in the space, if you will, if you're not taking any sort of approach on debt. So maybe talk about, rather than just talking about liquidity, let's talk about debt holistically. And is there any thoughts providing -- making a slide that shows where you want to be on debt targets over the next 2, 3, 4 years? Because it works for Delta and I think it's a nice story to tell for some of the incremental loan onlies that might be a little put off as everybody's RASM gets better midpoint of next year."

But first off, I would just -- I -- frankly, we don't agree with the premise and shareholders can make their own decisions obviously based upon what we do. But our view is the best thing for our shareholders, is to ensure that we have a sufficient amount of liquidity to withstand any sort of downturn. But the cost of getting to -- of worrying about credit ratings is in a business where we can -- we're borrowing against aircraft at 3%. It doesn't necessarily -- actually, it doesn't seem to be -- that goal, in and of itself, doesn't seem to be in our shareholders' best interest. So somewhat -- it's somewhat surprised with shareholder -- with people like you who'd push back on this, at least hear us out because we think we're doing what's best for our shareholders. At the end of the day, we're producing -- we are producing profits at levels we've -- this industry has never seen before, but consistent with what other industries do. We're very bullish on our ability to continue doing that over time. As we do so, the first thing we do is invest back in our company. This company needs a good bit of investment. We're investing at levels that no airlines ever invested before. The aircraft modernization I talked about has us now at aircraft levels that are -- at age levels that are well below our competitors, something like around 10 years and falling for us and 16, 17 years and increasing for them. And then investing -- on top of that, something that Derek said, $1.5 billion next year on improvements in the airlines. That's -- those are good investments, and we're excited about those. And those will provide returns for our shareholders. Those are long-lived assets. They're -- we're not off spending it on ancillary businesses or trying to do something we're not. We're doing what we think is right, and we feel very good about that. That investment, not return for shareholders. Once we do that, then we look to make sure we've paid down any high-end cost debt. We've done that. Derek and his team have done a phenomenal job of getting to while we have a larger amount of debt on the balance sheet than our peers, the cost of that debt is low. And as we look to each -- the incremental decision, by the way, comes down to that. We're adding airplanes as we do this modernization. Should we use some of our cash balance to pay for those aircraft or should we avail ourselves of 3% debt? And we think the best thing for our shareholders is to avail ourselves of the 3% debt. That leaves us with cash balances that are in excess of the target. And we think the right thing to do with that is to return to our shareholders. But the way we protect ourselves is having a much higher liquidity balance than others. That's the cost of it, but it's a much less costly thing than paying -- than not availing yourself of low-cost debt. And the other point I want to make is, even if we did those things, even if we started paying cash for aircraft, we'd still have higher debt. It's because we have better assets. When you have airplanes that are 9 years old versus someone else's 17 years old, you're going to have higher debt because you have much better assets. And they're going to be here for a long time. As are we -- and that's why we're doing this. So Saudi Arabia, this is -- we believe we're in the right spot. We're very comfortable with our leverage. We're very comfortable with the balance sheet. And we're doing the right thing for our shareholders."

I expect what you'll see in '17 is us do better than our competitors in terms of, certainly, year-over-year margins. You're seeing it already in the RASM, and that will continue into '17. You'll see on the cost front, as Derek noted, we -- the reason the margins declined even though we're having better RASM right now, of course, is because our CASM is up more. That's because we've gone in taking care of our people faster and gotten ourselves to a point where we have, in every work group, less than 3 years since the merger, we now have everyone on new pay scales that reflect the job they're doing for us, and that's increased our cost by a good bit. They were well below. We had to do that. We're happy we did that. Our shareholders should be happy we did that. But it's behind us now. We have one of those that was done mid-year, which is the TWIM, as Derek talked about, so that will have a year-over-year impact, but it's in the current cost structure. And beyond that, we don't see any sort of other cost increase certainly over and above kind of inflationary rates in the airline. So I think what you'll see, as we go through '17, is better revenue per ASM improvement on a year-over-year basis and better cost performance as well."

The one game-changer, maybe a big stretch of the word, but actually, certainly an improvement in how we can do that and still not -- and still be as good for American Airlines as it can be is basic economy. And so that product we have in place will allow us to do just that, but not at the same amount of dilution we have to American Airlines. So the impact to the spheres and the frontiers would be the same, we would aggressively match their prices but since -- as we put that product in place, it will have some attributes that some of our customers would rather don't care to purchase or are willing to purchase other attributes for more.

So I'll tell you this, we couldn't feel better about American Airlines' future and its financial future. And I also will tell you that based on what we think about the future, we're extremely bullish on the American stock, which is why we continue to purchase at the levels we do, because as we look out, targets or no targets, our projections even in difficult economic environments have this company being nice and profitable, and it doesn't feel like our stock reflects that. So we're happy to give you that guidance and let you do your own numbers.

So we all know absolute debt levels are higher than they've been historically. But with respect to the underlying business, I wonder if you could just help investors understand the leverage metrics relative to where they've been historically, maybe on an American standalone basis. So leverage metrics today relative to some average over some period of time that makes sense. And as you look at those metrics and as you feel comfortable about those metrics, is it that you expect profits to continue growing faster than the debt? And I wonder if you could just help us understand what do those metrics look like under your stress test?"

And thanks for bringing me back to it because I know when I said it, we're comfortable. What I meant was we're comfortable with where it is at this time, because looking to the future what we expect is you'll see those metrics continue to improve. I wasn't trying to suggest we're comfortable in keeping them exactly where they are, although we may be. But the reason we're comfortable with them at this time is because of what you say, we have very good line of sight as to what our capital requirements are going forward. We have a very -- we have -- we feel good about our -- certainly, even on a very -- in difficult economic times, stress testing against even things like recession about what our earnings would do as we go forward. So those -- that gives us comfort that we are in a good spot right now and when things come up like 3% interest, it seems to be an absolute no-brainer to us that the right thing to do is to take those debts on rather than using cash to pay airplanes and to use that cash for better purposes. So that's where we're comfortable with that. What happens over time, I would expect, and again, without giving the targets, is you will see, certainly, that the metrics that are tied, the coverage ratios, for example, that tie earnings to debt levels, you would see those get better over time, the earnings continue to get better. And as earnings get better and the debt gets lower, we are also, I should note, while we're well ahead of everyone in terms of modernizing our fleet, there will come a time that we've gotten that done in the not too distant future, and you won't see the debt continue to come out at these levels. So as debt gets lower over time and earnings continue, and EBITDA or margins, etc., stay where they are, you'll see those numbers get better. And that's why we're comfortable with where we are today. We're comfortable where we are today because of the reasons I said and believe we have the right structure in place. As insurance, we carry a lot more cash than others. But we think that's the better way to do this for our shareholders than to go and pay cash for airplanes rather than taking 3% debt on."

But we don't have a goal to say, we need to be below the others in aircraft age. But it's noteworthy, particularly when we get to conversations about relative debt levels, to point out how much stronger our asset base is my only point. And the best way for me to communicate that to you is to point out how much younger our fleet is. Look, it is absolutely a customer advantage, when you get one onboard new airplanes, there is one of our older airplanes, there is no doubt that it is a much better in-flight product and you can tell the difference. So we feel good about that. But you're right, the orders were in place and they're coming, and we're taking them. But the bigger point I'm trying to make here is these are -- if you look in the very near term, you may say, ""Oh my gosh, these guys -- they have all this debt."" These are 25-year assets, and those airlines that have 17-year-old airplanes won't be able to have 42-year-old airplanes 25 years from now. So at some point -- my point is we're ahead of them, and I'm not suggesting they need to go, spend enormous amount of capital in the very near term, but they will need to do something, and we won't have to at that point in time, that's the way this works. So at any rate, our goal isn't to make sure we have the absolute youngest, it's nice when you're in that position. But to the extent you want to look at relative debt levels, you need to look at the asset base, and our asset base is just worth tremendously more than theirs are."

We're performing very well, as I said, in my remarks with our corporate business. So in terms of the summer and the falloff, and that's really where I look at things and it is associated with the schedule where I think we -- just quite frankly, we were pretty aggressive in terms of the schedule that we put out this summer. We had issues in Los Angeles. We definitely had, I think, an inordinate amount of weather issues associated with DFW and then Charlotte and Miami, and that was problematic. So it seems like we're in a recovery phase a lot of -- during the summer. As I said before, we have a lot of integration tools that we didn't have that we will have in the future and that is on building the airline back after disruption and making sure our customers and their baggage is taken care of. One of the things you'll note though is that we continue to be really strong in terms of our departing on time performance, the D0 performance. That's something that we'll continue to see. And I think that, that will translate into more competitive arrivals within 14 performance. And you'll see as well, that in our completion factor as we move from operating 2 systems and really 3 systems in regard to our pilots down to 1, that we've got a chance to do much, much better. So I'm very optimistic of where we're headed. And if you take a look at where we're at right now, schedule reduction associated with the fall season with changes to our Los Angeles operation, we're operating back at near record levels and that should continue. And again, as I said before, all efforts are focused on making sure that we work together to put out a schedule in 2017 that we can operate reliably and competitively with the best in the business."

There are a lot of restrictions that are still in place that have made it difficult to sell.

Also in the room for our question-and-answer session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. 
As is our normal practice, we're going to start the call with Doug and he will provide an overview of the third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder -- for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions and lastly, questions from the media. 
Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.

Pretax earnings, excluding special items of $1.5 billion. It's down from last year's $1.9 billion. But that's driven both by declining unit revenues, our total -- our TRASM was down 2.2% versus last year. And increasing year cost, driven primarily by investments in our team. But while they're down, they're still the second best third quarter in the history of American Airlines behind only the third quarter 2015. 
Also because of our share repurchase activity, our adjusted EPS was actually up, even though earnings were down from $2.77 up to $2.80 in the quarter. 
So these results are due to the fantastic team at American who've done an amazing job for our customers. Every day we're extremely grateful for them and what they do. 
On the revenue front, Robert will provide a lot more detail, but we're encouraged by the trends. Our TRASM, as I said, was down 2.2% in the third quarter. But that's better than we've seen in terms of the decline in recent quarters. And it's better than our competitors are experiencing. In fact, our -- the month of September TRASM was actually improved year-over-year, which was the first month of year-over-year TRASM improvement for American Airlines since November 2014. Now of course, September was helped by the calendar on a year-over-year basis, which is why we at American don't really like to focus much on monthly unit revenue numbers. But the trend is good and it appears to be continuing, as Robert will discuss. 
Our unit costs grew in the quarter and Derek will talk -- will provide more detail on that. But the primary driver of the unit cost increase is our decision to invest in our seat. We have pay increases and profit sharing that are, by far, the largest drivers of the cost increase. and we're pleased to be able to provide those improvements to our team members. We've now reached new agreements with all of our work groups, so the large increases are behind us. 
Furthermore, as we complete more of our integration in 2017, we'll be able to begin eliminating some of the redundancies that still exist because of 2 airlines, and that'll help us reduce expenses in 2018 and beyond. 
As integration, we had an enormous success earlier this month with the flawless integration of our flight operating system or FOS. This is an extremely complicated system integration that's led to operational disruptions with other airlines as they've gone through mergers. And our team executed it without it -- without a hitch. 
While we're doing all that, we continue to invest in the product and improve the product. We had 12 new aircraft as part of our unprecedented fleet renewal program import. American's fleet is now more than 40% younger than our large network peers and that gap is widening. 
We added 10 new destinations to our network, including 5 in Cuba, a new service to -- from LAX to Hong Kong. And next month, we'll begin daily flights to Havana, cementing our position as the largest carrier to Cuba. 
We continue to make enormous improvements to our clubs, including in this quarter, the reopening of a renovated Admirals Club in Rio de Janeiro and the refurbishment of our London Heathrow Arrivals Club, which now has 29 shower rooms and a business center. 
So in summary, this -- the U.S. airline industry has been transformed and American Airlines is well positioned for success in the new world. We're producing record profits -- near record profits despite a soft economic environment, and we're using those profits to improve customer service through important investments in both our products and our team. And we're returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
Though there's much work ahead, but the American team continues to improve [indiscernible] challenge. We're extremely pleased with where we are and very bullish on the future of American Airlines. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Derek, who will provide more details on the financial results. And then to our recently appointed President, Robert Isom, who will discuss operating performance and revenue environment. Derek?"

Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We've filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning.

We've filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $737 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This compares to our third quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.49 per diluted share. And if we exclude the special charges, we reported a net profit of $933 million in the third quarter of 2016 or $1.76 per diluted share versus the third quarter net profit of $1.9 billion in 2015 or $2.77 per diluted share. 
Our GAAP third quarter pretax profit was $1.2 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 11.2%. Excluding special charges, our third quarter pretax profit was $1.5 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 14%. Excluding the effects of special charges and the noncash tax provision of $449 million, our third quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.80 per share compared to $2.77 in the third quarter of 2015, reflecting a 22% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the quarter. 
We continue to see sequential improvement in the revenue environment during the quarter, which Robert will talk more about. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.6 billion, down 1.1% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9.1 billion, down 2.2%, driven by a 0.6% decline in yields. Cargoes were -- cargo revenues were down 5.1% to $171 million due primarily to a decline in international and domestic yields. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 8.5% versus the same period last year due to the impact of the new credit card deal signed with Barclays U.S., Citi and MasterCard on July 12, 2016. 
Total GAAP operating expenses were $9.2 billion, up 5.2% versus the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in our people through contractual increases and the introduction of profit sharing plan, investments in our product, investment which includes our fleet, as Doug talked about, and investments in our operation. These investments were offset in part by lower fuel costs. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the third quarter of 2016, was down 12.4% year-over-year to $1.46 per gallon. 
Third quarter mainline cost per ASM was $0.1196, up 5.6% year-over-year. Excluding special charges in fuel, our mainline CASM was $0.0932, up 8.9% year-over-year. Regional operating cost per ASM in the third quarter was $0.1885, which was down 5.2% from the third quarter in 2015. Excluding special charges in fuel, regional CASM was $0.1508, a decrease of 4.4% due to the continued shift to more efficient large regional jets. 
We entered the third quarter of 2016 with approximately $9.2 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.8 billion and $2.4 billion in an undrawn revolver capacity well in the excess -- well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimal liquidity we seek to maintain for this foreseeable future. The company also had $635 million classified as restricted cash during the quarter. 
We did generate $1.1 billion during the quarter of cash flow from operations and made $372 million in debt payments. We continue to believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program, which will be substantially complete in 2017. 
During the quarter, the company took advantage of favorable market conditions and completed several financing transactions, including a repricing of the company's 2014 term loan collateralized by our London Heathrow slots, which reduced interest by 25 basis points and the issuance of $814 million EETC consisting of
[Audio Gap]
Shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share of distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 31% from 756 million at merger close in December 2013 to 519.2 million shares on September 30, 2016. At the end of the third quarter 2016, the company had approximately $555 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. We continue to monitor our capacity plans. And in our IR update issued last week, we lowered full year 2016 system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 1.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline capacity to be 57.5 billion ASMs and our regional capacity to be 7.84 billion ASMs. So our consolidated capacity will be flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM, excluding special items and fuel, to be up approximately 5% to 7% while regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to be up between 8% and 10%. This year-over-year increase is driven primarily by investment in our people of about 6 points, maintenance timing of 2 points and D&A from new aircraft and increased CapEx of 1 point. Regional CASM, excluding special items and fuel, is expected to be down by approximately 3% to 5% in the same period. 
As we look forward for the first time since mid-2014, year-over-year fuel prices are expected to be higher through the remainder of the year. Based on the forward curve as of October 17, our mainline fuel price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2016 is $1.59 to $1.64 per gallon, while our regional fuel forecast for the fourth quarter is $1.65 to $1.70. Despite these higher fuel prices, we expect our full year 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year. 
Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided, along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give, we expect our fourth quarter pretax margin, excluding special items, to be between 4% and 6%. 
For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in 2016. We have 20 deliveries worth approximately $1.1 billion, which will occur in the fourth quarter. And we expect to invest $300 million in non-aircraft CapEx in the quarter, which is $1.2 billion for the full year, which includes continued integration work and investments to improve our product and operations, some that Doug referred to in his comments. 
Looking out to 2017. We are taking a disciplined approach to matching our planned capacity levels with anticipated levels of demand. We are still in the process of developing our operating plan, so our formal capacity guidance will come out when we report fourth quarter earnings. But we currently expect our year-over-year system capacity to be up approximately 1% in 2017. We expect full year 2017 domestic capacity to be flat, while our international capacity is expected to be up approximately 3.5%. Our international growth is driven primarily by our Pacific entity as we annualize the new routes added in 2016. 
We'll also know more about our 2017 unit cost projections after we complete our operating plan, but as Doug noted, we now have the bulk of our cost increases behind us. As we look to 2017, we expect the full year impact of our labor agreements will add approximately 2 points of CASM. But otherwise, our core CASM growth should be around 2% on a very modest 1% growth in ASMs. And as Doug also noted, with the integration nearing completion, we will be able to begin the process of eliminating some redundancies in 2017, which will help our unit cost in 2018 and beyond. 
So in conclusion, we couldn't be more proud of more than 100,000 team members who continue to deliver outstanding results. We continue to make great progress integrating our airlines most recently with our flight operating system cut over, and we've already seen some positive results. We are also excited about the commercial initiatives our team is working on and looking forward to reporting on their continued success on future calls. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert."

I'd like to start out by thanking our 100,000 team members for their outstanding work during the quarter. And I'd characterized this quarter as being one of operational and commercial challenges. But I would like to underscore positively that we have executed integration items exceptionally well. Despite all these challenges, our team's commitment to taking care of our customers and each other has never wavered. 
Summer ops performance was challenging for both our employees and customers. The primary driver was inclement weather that seemed to settle over a number of our hubs throughout the summer, most notably Dallas, or DFW. in addition, we struggled to operate our expanded Los Angeles schedule reliably, primarily due to airport and facility constraints. We're working with LAWA, so that we will be better able to meet our customers' demands to fly American from Los Angeles going forward. 
I'm happy to report that our reliability has rebounded to near-record levels across our system in September as a result of a number of factors, and those trends have continued well into October. And we expect that they will continue. 
Again, I appreciate the efforts of our frontline team to take care of our customers throughout the summer and especially, and most recently, during Hurricane Matthew. 
We have successfully completed some major integration milestones over the past few months, including a single-flight operating system for our pilots, dispatch and aircraft. And I'm so appreciative of our 15,000 pilots, the APA, our IT and flight ops teams for their efforts to ensure a seamless cutover. 
We've also put new uniforms on all of our employees. We have interim agreements with our fleet service and mechanic workgroups, tentative agreements now with our flight crew training instructors and SIM engineers. And once these tentative agreements have been ratified, all American team members will be benefiting from pay increases that resulted from our merger. So much of what we're striving to accomplish going forward would be difficult to address without having the integration work completed and completed well. 
As we start to think about our plans for next year, there's good reason to believe that American will improve versus the industry in operations performance. We're taking a fresh look at how we schedule our aircraft for reliability. Our 777-200 reconfigurations will be completed by December 2017. Our 787 fleet has reached a critical mass, allowing for easier recovery from off-scheduled ops. And with the single-flight operating system, our aircraft and pilots can now be used interchangeably instead of being managed as separate entities. We're also making big investments in service recovery and customer notification tools for passengers and employees that will continue to roll out next year. 
On the revenue front, our third quarter TRASM was down 2.2%. While the revenue environment is still challenging in certain areas of the world, we have observed improvements in many places. Third -- the third quarter was much better than the second quarter, so we continue to see improving trends. As Doug noted, in September, we had positive year-over-year TRASM and PRASM, and that's the first time this has occurred since November 2014. And we're seeing improving trends in cargo as well. September marked the first time since December 2014 that our monthly year-over-year cargo revenue has improved. 
Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 1.8%. This was our best result since the first quarter of 2015. We saw strength across the board with all hubs having second derivative improvements. Los Angeles and DCA were top performers year-over-year. 
Internationally, we have lapped the dollar strengthening last year as well as declining international surcharges. LATAM was our first entity to turn positive with PRASM up 1.8% for the quarter, driven by a 25% year-over-year improvement in Brazil PRASM as capacity rationalized and the real strengthened. In addition, there was continued strength in Mexico. 
The Atlantic was our worst-performing international entity, down 11.2%. The main drivers of performance are continued capacity increases, specifically from low-cost carriers, the devaluation of the British pound as a result of the Brexit vote and lingering impacts from recent terrorist attacks. 
Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10.5% on capacity increases of 28.7% with continued weakness in China due to excess capacity and growing into our new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Haneda, Sydney and Auckland. 
We're pleased to see corporate passenger demand holding up, driven by our domestic entity. In the third quarter, we saw increases in both absolute revenue and revenue share. And we see similar trends developing in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, we see some choppiness in the fourth quarter due to holiday shifts with September and January benefiting from traffic shifting from October and December. We expect November to be the strongest month of the quarter versus 2015. 
Regionally, the domestic fourth quarter looks about the same as the third quarter due to holidays shifts. 
In Latin America, we expect continued sequential improvement and low single digit increases in PRASM. We expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with low double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. With that, we expect our fourth quarter TRASM, not PRASM, but total RASM to be down 1% to 3% year-over-year. We expect that our fourth quarter decline to be smaller than our third quarter decline despite a more difficult fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. As we look forward to 2017, we expect continued second derivative improvement in year-over-year TRASM performance and look forward to getting to positive TRASM in the first half of the year. 
In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at American Airlines. We've made a tremendous amount of progress over this past year with respect to integration, operational improvement and getting back on path to positive TRASM. All of these important steps are critical to restoring American Airlines to its rightful industry-leading position. We have a lot of work left to do, but we're confident we have the right plans, the right team in place to execute, and we look forward to reporting back on future successes. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin the question-and-answer session."

But first off, I would just -- I -- frankly, we don't agree with the premise and shareholders can make their own decisions obviously based upon what we do. But our view is the best thing for our shareholders, is to ensure that we have a sufficient amount of liquidity to withstand any sort of downturn. But the cost of getting to -- of worrying about credit ratings is in a business where we can -- we're borrowing against aircraft at 3%. It doesn't necessarily -- actually, it doesn't seem to be -- that goal, in and of itself, doesn't seem to be in our shareholders' best interest. So somewhat -- it's somewhat surprised with shareholder -- with people like you who'd push back on this, at least hear us out because we think we're doing what's best for our shareholders. At the end of the day, we're producing -- we are producing profits at levels we've -- this industry has never seen before, but consistent with what other industries do. We're very bullish on our ability to continue doing that over time. As we do so, the first thing we do is invest back in our company. This company needs a good bit of investment. We're investing at levels that no airlines ever invested before. The aircraft modernization I talked about has us now at aircraft levels that are -- at age levels that are well below our competitors, something like around 10 years and falling for us and 16, 17 years and increasing for them. And then investing -- on top of that, something that Derek said, $1.5 billion next year on improvements in the airlines. That's -- those are good investments, and we're excited about those. And those will provide returns for our shareholders. Those are long-lived assets. They're -- we're not off spending it on ancillary businesses or trying to do something we're not. We're doing what we think is right, and we feel very good about that. That investment, not return for shareholders. Once we do that, then we look to make sure we've paid down any high-end cost debt. We've done that. Derek and his team have done a phenomenal job of getting to while we have a larger amount of debt on the balance sheet than our peers, the cost of that debt is low. And as we look to each -- the incremental decision, by the way, comes down to that. We're adding airplanes as we do this modernization. Should we use some of our cash balance to pay for those aircraft or should we avail ourselves of 3% debt? And we think the best thing for our shareholders is to avail ourselves of the 3% debt. That leaves us with cash balances that are in excess of the target. And we think the right thing to do with that is to return to our shareholders. But the way we protect ourselves is having a much higher liquidity balance than others. That's the cost of it, but it's a much less costly thing than paying -- than not availing yourself of low-cost debt. And the other point I want to make is, even if we did those things, even if we started paying cash for aircraft, we'd still have higher debt. It's because we have better assets. When you have airplanes that are 9 years old versus someone else's 17 years old, you're going to have higher debt because you have much better assets. And they're going to be here for a long time. As are we -- and that's why we're doing this. So Saudi Arabia, this is -- we believe we're in the right spot. We're very comfortable with our leverage. We're very comfortable with the balance sheet. And we're doing the right thing for our shareholders."

You'll see on the cost front, as Derek noted, we -- the reason the margins declined even though we're having better RASM right now, of course, is because our CASM is up more. That's because we've gone in taking care of our people faster and gotten ourselves to a point where we have, in every work group, less than 3 years since the merger, we now have everyone on new pay scales that reflect the job they're doing for us, and that's increased our cost by a good bit. They were well below. We had to do that. We're happy we did that. Our shareholders should be happy we did that. But it's behind us now. We have one of those that was done mid-year, which is the TWIM, as Derek talked about, so that will have a year-over-year impact, but it's in the current cost structure. And beyond that, we don't see any sort of other cost increase certainly over and above kind of inflationary rates in the airline. So I think what you'll see, as we go through '17, is better revenue per ASM improvement on a year-over-year basis and better cost performance as well."

The brunt -- the biggest portion of them will start coming in '18, so we'll have all of those aircraft going through Mod in '17. So we will monetize those seats through probably MCE, our Main Cabin Extra product that we have today until we get to the critical mass and then we'll be able to put out -- roll out the Premium Economy. So I think that it's more of an '18 impact than it is a '17 impact due to having to modify all of our wide-body aircraft for that product."

The one game-changer, maybe a big stretch of the word, but actually, certainly an improvement in how we can do that and still not -- and still be as good for American Airlines as it can be is basic economy. And so that product we have in place will allow us to do just that, but not at the same amount of dilution we have to American Airlines.

I understand the value that it could provide, just know that I've been doing this way too long and I'm often reluctant to do -- it depends on how we define the target.

So we sometimes are less comfortable than others trying to set things like margins -- margin targets when we know that some things that affect those margins are outside of our control, primarily the economy and fuel prices. So I'll tell you this, we couldn't feel better about American Airlines' future and its financial future. And I also will tell you that based on what we think about the future, we're extremely bullish on the American stock, which is why we continue to purchase at the levels we do, because as we look out, targets or no targets, our projections even in difficult economic environments have this company being nice and profitable, and it doesn't feel like our stock reflects that. So we're happy to give you that guidance and let you do your own numbers.

So we all know absolute debt levels are higher than they've been historically. But with respect to the underlying business, I wonder if you could just help investors understand the leverage metrics relative to where they've been historically, maybe on an American standalone basis. So leverage metrics today relative to some average over some period of time that makes sense. And as you look at those metrics and as you feel comfortable about those metrics, is it that you expect profits to continue growing faster than the debt? And I wonder if you could just help us understand what do those metrics look like under your stress test?"

And thanks for bringing me back to it because I know when I said it, we're comfortable. What I meant was we're comfortable with where it is at this time, because looking to the future what we expect is you'll see those metrics continue to improve. I wasn't trying to suggest we're comfortable in keeping them exactly where they are, although we may be. But the reason we're comfortable with them at this time is because of what you say, we have very good line of sight as to what our capital requirements are going forward. We have a very -- we have -- we feel good about our -- certainly, even on a very -- in difficult economic times, stress testing against even things like recession about what our earnings would do as we go forward. So those -- that gives us comfort that we are in a good spot right now and when things come up like 3% interest, it seems to be an absolute no-brainer to us that the right thing to do is to take those debts on rather than using cash to pay airplanes and to use that cash for better purposes. So that's where we're comfortable with that. What happens over time, I would expect, and again, without giving the targets, is you will see, certainly, that the metrics that are tied, the coverage ratios, for example, that tie earnings to debt levels, you would see those get better over time, the earnings continue to get better. And as earnings get better and the debt gets lower, we are also, I should note, while we're well ahead of everyone in terms of modernizing our fleet, there will come a time that we've gotten that done in the not too distant future, and you won't see the debt continue to come out at these levels. So as debt gets lower over time and earnings continue, and EBITDA or margins, etc., stay where they are, you'll see those numbers get better. And that's why we're comfortable with where we are today. We're comfortable where we are today because of the reasons I said and believe we have the right structure in place. As insurance, we carry a lot more cash than others. But we think that's the better way to do this for our shareholders than to go and pay cash for airplanes rather than taking 3% debt on."

But we don't have a goal to say, we need to be below the others in aircraft age. But it's noteworthy, particularly when we get to conversations about relative debt levels, to point out how much stronger our asset base is my only point. And the best way for me to communicate that to you is to point out how much younger our fleet is. Look, it is absolutely a customer advantage, when you get one onboard new airplanes, there is one of our older airplanes, there is no doubt that it is a much better in-flight product and you can tell the difference. So we feel good about that. But you're right, the orders were in place and they're coming, and we're taking them. But the bigger point I'm trying to make here is these are -- if you look in the very near term, you may say, ""Oh my gosh, these guys -- they have all this debt."" These are 25-year assets, and those airlines that have 17-year-old airplanes won't be able to have 42-year-old airplanes 25 years from now. So at some point -- my point is we're ahead of them, and I'm not suggesting they need to go, spend enormous amount of capital in the very near term, but they will need to do something, and we won't have to at that point in time, that's the way this works. So at any rate, our goal isn't to make sure we have the absolute youngest, it's nice when you're in that position. But to the extent you want to look at relative debt levels, you need to look at the asset base, and our asset base is just worth tremendously more than theirs are."

We're performing very well, as I said, in my remarks with our corporate business. So in terms of the summer and the falloff, and that's really where I look at things and it is associated with the schedule where I think we -- just quite frankly, we were pretty aggressive in terms of the schedule that we put out this summer. We had issues in Los Angeles. We definitely had, I think, an inordinate amount of weather issues associated with DFW and then Charlotte and Miami, and that was problematic. So it seems like we're in a recovery phase a lot of -- during the summer. As I said before, we have a lot of integration tools that we didn't have that we will have in the future and that is on building the airline back after disruption and making sure our customers and their baggage is taken care of. One of the things you'll note though is that we continue to be really strong in terms of our departing on time performance, the D0 performance. That's something that we'll continue to see. And I think that, that will translate into more competitive arrivals within 14 performance. And you'll see as well, that in our completion factor as we move from operating 2 systems and really 3 systems in regard to our pilots down to 1, that we've got a chance to do much, much better. So I'm very optimistic of where we're headed. And if you take a look at where we're at right now, schedule reduction associated with the fall season with changes to our Los Angeles operation, we're operating back at near record levels and that should continue. And again, as I said before, all efforts are focused on making sure that we work together to put out a schedule in 2017 that we can operate reliably and competitively with the best in the business."

When we look at kind of the trends in Latin America, we would expect -- Brazil was a big factor, obviously, in the overall result, and we're expecting our performance in Brazil in the fourth quarter to be better, materially better than the performance in the third quarter. So we think our performance in Latin America overall is going to continue to get better. And as for Cuba, I think everyone is struggling a little bit in terms of selling in Cuba. There are a lot of restrictions that are still in place that have made it difficult to sell. Right now, we're seeing the greatest strength in terms of forward booking, in the Havana markets where we've had a long presence with our charter operations. But I think charter -- Cuba is going to be a bit of a long route, I think."

Thanks, everybody. Again, look, the story to this -- from my perspective listening to all this is -- we -- this team when we did this merger less than 3 years ago, the biggest questions we get on this call was concerns about our ability to manage the integration. And I couldn't be more pleased with the work the team has done to get through, flawlessly, things like PSS and just now FOS, so the waves hitting here has helped us -- manages through us. But this is a full team effort, which is why it's so hard, it takes cross-functional work while people are trying actually do their full jobs, too. So we are elated that, that concern we've been able to take off your list of concerns, and that's important. But what it's more important about is it shows what a great team we have here and the things we can do and now with much of that work behind us, not all of it, but much of it behind us, we're extremely excited about everything that we have going on, particularly the investments we're making in our people, in our product that will accrue to our customers. And the upside that, that provides us, but we're in this for the long term. We're excited about the long term, and we appreciate your support. Thanks."
