Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about or references to our internal models and our long-term objectives. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today. 
Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated January 7, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some key points from the press release. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.09, in line with the preliminary estimate of $1.07 to $1.10 provided in our December 22 press release. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of about 30 basis points over the prior year or 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales decreased approximately 40 basis points or a relatively flat on a constant currency basis. 
The company is modeling fiscal fourth quarter 2015 net earnings per diluted share of approximately $1.72 to $1.86 and is now modeling fiscal 2015 full year net earnings per diluted share of approximately $4.91 to $5.05.
I will now turn the call over to Steven for his perspective on our third quarter results. He will also discuss our operational results and the progress we've made on some of our strategic initiatives. Later in the call, Sue will discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail as well as review some of our key modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015.

As we said on",1471,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. As you see from our press release and consistent with our prior announcement on December 22, our performance in the third quarter reflects the recent retail trends we have been experiencing. 
As we said on the one hand we experienced softer in-store transaction counts and on the other hand, sales from our customer-facing digital channels demonstrated strong growth in excess of 25%. These mixed results were against the backdrop of the overall softness reported in the macro retail environment during the quarter.
During the third quarter, we experienced a low single-digit percentage decline in our comparable sales consummated in stores. At the same time, our customer-facing digital channels, we are pleased that we have seen continued growth in both number of visits to our selling websites as well as in a number of orders placed on both desktop and mobile. 
In our mobile channels, we set new record highs across all key performance indicators during the third quarter, including traffic, orders, sales, average order value and conversion. Mobile sales during the quarter increased more than 2.5x compared to the same period last year. These results directionally followed the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and softer comps in stores. 
As consumers shopping preferences continue to shift, we remain focused on providing a seamless customer experience across all of our retail channels so that our customers can interact with us, however, where ever and whenever they choose.
In our December 22 press release, we anticipated comparable sales through Christmas to increase approximately 1%. Comparable sales from the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter through Christmas are actually slightly ahead of that plan. Sue will have more to say on our modeling assumptions for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year in a few minutes.
As we said, the retail environment continues to evolve, and we are making investments throughout the company, including in the areas of information technology, marketing, analytics, merchandising and customer service to further our market-leading position in the categories for which we are best known. And to do even more for with our customers. 
While we recognize that the investments we are making impact our operating profit in the short term, we believe our never say no culture and the strength of our balance sheet provide a strong foundation and through the differentiated products, services and solutions we provide, we continue to further, our efforts to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interest and travel through their life stages.
While most pure play retailers who primarily sell merchandise and home-related categories are struggling with profitability and others rely on outside sources of capital to remain viable, our company generates healthy cash flows and our strong balance sheet enables us to make strategic investments necessary to continue to create a best-in-class, omnichannel platform to position us for long-term success.
Some examples of recent enhancements to our website include a new feature for both desktop and mobile that enables customers to upload their own personal content such as images in how they have used products that other customers may view, enjoy and use them as inspiration. 
Also with regard to our websites and apps, we have begun piloting a new solution for our customers to manage their Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY coupon and promotional offers in one place. My offers is our virtual coupon wallet that organizes in-stores' print and digital install coupons, includes the ability to scan and upload paper coupons so customers can access and redeem them conveniently. We continue to learn from customer usage as we further develop the appropriate strategic implementation of this customer-centric solution.
Another new offering on the Bed Bath & Beyond website is the ability to personalize products using a monogram and etching of our personal image on towel, glassware, rugs and many other giftable items. Over time, we plan to expand the selection and assortment available for personalization. 
With regard to merchandising, we've introduced new categories and steadily expanded our assortment in others and will continue to do so. We currently have hundreds of thousands of SKUs available online and/or in-store. Our goal is both to increase our overall assortment as well as to continue to curate and present the right assortment to our customers. This requires the ongoing effort to review, edit, define and present our offering based on feedback from our customers as well as the learnings from our merchant marketing and analytics teams.
Advancement in information technology further our efforts to connect with our customers across all of our retail channels. We continue to build on our omnichannel strategy by creating services and experiences that are seamless across our digital and physical channels. For example, we have enhanced our online registry experience this year about leading and back to college by expanding the ability for registrants and potential registrants to schedule an appointment with one of our expert consultants in their local store. 
In addition, we have recently launched a social shopping feature that enables registrants to invite their family and friends to recommend items that are registries. Our service initiative this year also included the opening of our new customer contact center in October 2015. Located in Layton, Utah, this new contact center enables us to supplement our 24/7 East Coast contact center operations with additional high-quality service and support. We are committed to ever improving our customer experiences wherever, whenever and however our customers wish to interact with us.
This year in an effort to improve the efficiency and speed of delivery to our customers, and conjunction with using our stores for fulfillment, we expanded the number of distribution facilities we have to 10, including our newest facilities that opened earlier this year in Las Vegas. In addition, in the fall of 2016, we plan to open a new 800,000 square foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. We will continue to assess sites throughout the country for the potential to gain even greater distribution efficiencies.
We also have other important initiatives underway, including the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores, continued investments in analytics and marketing, which make it possible for us to develop a more comprehensive view of our customers and drive better customer engagement through personalized target marketing; and ongoing development of a new point-of-sale system. Now real estate efforts, we are on track to approximately open 29 and close 11 stores during fiscal 2015. 
We had a total of 12 openings during the third quarter and for the 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 6 Cost Plus World Market stores and 1 buybuy BABY store. We also closed 6 Bed Bath & Beyond stores during the quarter. Since the start of our fourth quarter, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 1 Cost Plus World Market stores. Year-to-date, we have opened 22 stores and closed 7.
As we've said previously, we actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time, to optimize market profitability. This flexible approach has been an important part of our success and will continue to be going forward, especially as the digital and physical retail channels become more integrated. We believe that physical stores provide a significant competitive advantage and we concentrate on finding the right balance of physical and digital presence to optimize the products, services and solutions we offer to our customers.
For example, as you may know, we have leased approximately 130,000 square feet of space in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn to house 4 of our concepts under 1 roof. This project gives us an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and further integrate our omnichannel capabilities to provide a more experiential shopping environment. We are planning to be open this summer.
In Mexico, our joint venture now operates 7 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including our newest store in medevac, which opened in early December 2015 and is our second store located outside of the Mexico City market. Along with our partners, we remain excited about the growth opportunities in Mexico.
In addition to our retail operations, we continue to grow our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge, distribution synergies and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
As I said earlier, we view the ever-evolving retail environment as an opportune time for us to drive change through significant investments in our business both online and in-store. We remain committed to and focused on positioning our company for long-term success. I'll now turn the call over to Sue."

I'll begin with a review of our third quarter results and then provide an update on some of our key modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015 as well as provide a few modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016.Net sales for the",1513,"Thank you, Steven. I'll begin with a review of our third quarter results and then provide an update on some of our key modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015 as well as provide a few modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016.
Net sales for the third quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 30 basis points higher than net sales in the prior year period or approximately 70 basis points higher on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales for the third quarter decreased approximately 40 basis points or a relatively flat on a constant currency basis, reflecting an increase in the average transaction amount and a decrease in the number of transactions. 
As Steven said, sales from our customer-facing digital channels demonstrated strong growth in excess of 25%, while our comparable sales in stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range. Gross profit for the third quarter was approximately 37.8% of net sales compared to approximately 38.4% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased, primarily due to an increase in inventory acquisition costs. 
Also contributing to the decrease as a percentage of net sales, was an increase in coupon expense resulting from a slight increase in the number of redemptions and the slight increase in the average coupon amount. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were approximately 27.9% of net sales as compared to 26.4% of net sales in the prior year period. Of the increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, approximately 45 basis points was attributable to a nonrecurring benefit relating to credit card litigation settlement in the third quarter of 2014, which was not down anniversary-ed this quarter. 
This nonrecurring prior year benefit was approximately $0.05 per diluted share based on this quarter's actual share count. The majority of the remaining increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales in order of magnitude was due to an increase in payroll and payroll-related items and an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising.
Our tax rate for the third quarter 2015 was approximately 35.3% compared to approximately 32.3% in the third quarter of 2014. The third quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarter's of approximately $6.9 million this year as compared to approximately $16.7 million last year. This year-over-year unfavorable difference is approximately $0.06 based on this quarter's actual share count. 
Considering all of this activity, including the unfavorable, noncomparable items totaling $0.11, which I just mentioned as well as approximately $0.02 from an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact in the third quarter of 2015, net earnings per diluted share were $1.09 for the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.23 for the third quarter of 2014, in line with the preliminary estimate we provided on December 22.
Turning to some highlights on the balance sheet. As of November 28, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $565 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $3.2 billion at cost. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the 9 months of 2015 were approximately $244 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements, the new customer contact center, the new distribution facility in Las Vegas as well as other projects.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $194 million, representing about 3.3 million shares repurchased during the period. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $110 million at the end of the third quarter and is now expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. 
Upon completion of the current program, the company will begin to repurchase shares under its new $2.5 billion share repurchase program authorized in September 2015. As a reminder, our quarterly share repurchase activity may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Now I'd like to provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. These include the following: based upon fourth quarter sales to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the quarter, we are now modeling comparable sales to be between relatively flat and an increase of approximately 2%, including an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 30 basis points. We are modeling comparable sales consummated through our customer-facing websites and mobile apps to grow in excess of 25% and store comp to be a low single-digit decreased to a relatively flat for the fourth quarter. 
As Steven mentioned earlier, this directionally follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and softer comps in stores. For the full year, we are modeling comparable sales to increase in a range of approximately 0.6% to 1.1%, including an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 40 basis points.
Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase approximately 0.7% to 2.7% in the fourth quarter. This results in a model full year consolidated net sales increase of approximately 1.4% to 1.9%. Our model includes an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 40 basis points for the fourth quarter and full year.
Assuming these sales levels, we continue to model gross profit deleverage as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter and full year. We also continue to model the full year gross margin deleverage to be less than it was in fiscal 2014. We are modeling SG&A deleverage for both the fourth quarter and full year, which includes increases in investments in compensation and benefits, advertising and technology-related expenses. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2015 is expected to be approximately $260 million. 
Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $83 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated to be in the mid-30s percentage range with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow. Capital expenditures in 2015 are now modeled to be approximately $350 million, subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects continue to represent a significant portion of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omnichannel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued installment of new equipment and systems in conjunction with the utilization of our new data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system.
Our model reflects completion of our current $2 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2015, at which time we plan to repurchase shares under our new $2.5 billion authorization and we estimate that new program to be completed in fiscal 2019. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
We are modeling diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 160 million for the fourth quarter and approximately 165 million for the full year. We are modeling an unfavorable foreign currency rate -- exchange rate impact of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2015 based on a Canadian currency exchange rate for the fourth quarter of approximately CAD 1.38 to each U.S. dollar. This $0.06 estimate includes approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter.
Based upon these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.72 to $1.86 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year modeled net earnings per diluted share to a range of approximately $4.91 to $5.05.
Turning to fiscal 2016. While we are in the process of completing our annual budget, our preliminary modeling assumptions include the following: we expect to make continued investments in technology and in our omnichannel capabilities. We anticipate opening approximately 30 stores across all concepts and closing approximately 10 stores. We expect to continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
We anticipate interest expense of approximately $81 million, including the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. We expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rate. Our model reflects repurchases under our new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization with an assumed completion in fiscal 2019. And which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
We expect comparable sales growth from our customer-facing digital channels to continue to exceed comparable sales growth in stores. We will provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year of 2016 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2016. I'll now turn the call back to Steven."

We also have other important initiatives underway, including the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores, continued investments in analytics and marketing, which make it possible for us to develop a more comprehensive view of our customers and drive better customer engagement through personalized target marketing and ongoing development of a new point-of-sale system. Now real estate efforts, we are on track to approximately open 29 and close 11 stores during fiscal 2015. 
We had a total of 12 door openings during the third quarter, including 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 6 Cost Plus World Market stores and 1 buybuy BABY store. We also closed 6 Bed Bath & Beyond stores during the quarter. Since the start of our fourth quarter, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 1 Cost Plus World Market stores. Year-to-date, we have opened 22 stores and closed 7.
As we've said previously, we actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time, to optimize market profitability. This flexible approach has been an important part of our success and will continue to be going forward, especially as the digital and physical retail channels become more integrated. We believe that physical stores provide a significant competitive advantage and we concentrate on finding the right balance of physical and digital presence to optimize the products, services and solutions we offer to our customers.
For example, as you may know, we have leased approximately 130,000 square feet of space in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn to house 4 of our concepts under one roof. This project gives us an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and further integrate our omni-channel capabilities to provide a more experiential shopping environment. We are planning to be open this summer.
In Mexico, our joint venture now operates 7 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including our newest store in [indiscernible], which opened in early December 2015 and is our second store located outside of the Mexico City market. Along with our partners, we remain excited about the growth opportunities in Mexico.
In addition to our retail operations, we continue to grow our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge, distribution synergies and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
As I said earlier, we view the ever-evolving retail environment as an opportune time for us to drive change through significant investments in our business both online and in-store. We remain committed to and focused on positioning our company for long-term success. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue."

I'll begin with a review of our third quarter results and then provide an update on some of our key modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015 as well as provide a few modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016.
Net sales for the third quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 30 basis points higher than net sales in the prior year period or approximately 70 basis points higher on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales for the third quarter decreased approximately 40 basis points or a relatively flat on a constant currency basis, reflecting an increase in the average transaction amount and a decrease in the number of transactions. 
As Steven said, sales from our customer-facing digital channels demonstrated strong growth in excess of 25%, while our comparable sales in stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range. 
Gross profit for the third quarter was approximately 37.8% of net sales compared to approximately 38.4% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased, primarily due to an increase in inventory acquisition costs. 
Also contributing to the decrease as a percentage of net sales was an increase in coupon expense resulting from a slight increase in the number of redemptions and the slight increase in the average coupon amount. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were approximately 27.9% of net sales as compared to 26.4% of net sales in the prior year period. Of the increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, approximately 45 basis points was attributable to a nonrecurring benefit relating to credit card litigation settlement in a third quarter of 2014, which was not anniversary-ed this quarter. 
This nonrecurring prior year benefit was approximately $0.05 per diluted share based on this quarter's actual share count. The majority of the remaining increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales in order of magnitude was due to an increase in payroll and payroll-related items and an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising.
Our tax rate for the third quarter 2015 was approximately 35.3% compared to approximately 32.3% in the third quarter of 2014. The third quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarter's of approximately $6.9 million this year as compared to approximately $16.7 million last year. This year-over-year unfavorable difference is approximately $0.06 based on this quarter's actual share count. 
Considering all of this activity, including the unfavorable, noncomparable items totaling $0.11, which I just mentioned as well as approximately $0.02 from an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact in the third quarter of 2015, net earnings per diluted share were $1.09 for the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.23 for the third quarter of 2014, in line with the preliminary estimate we provided on December 22.
Turning to some highlights on the balance sheet. As of November 28, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $565 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $3.2 billion at cost. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the 9 months of 2015 were approximately $244 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements, the new customer contact center, the new distribution facility in Las Vegas as well as other projects.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $194 million, representing about 3.3 million shares repurchased during the period. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $110 million at the end of the third quarter and is now expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. 
Upon completion of the current program, the company will begin to repurchase shares under its new $2.5 billion share repurchase program authorized in September 2015. As a reminder, our quarterly share repurchase activity may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Now I'd like to provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. These include the following: based upon fourth quarter sales to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the quarter, we are now modeling comparable sales to be between relatively flat and an increase of approximately 2%, including an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 30 basis points. We are modeling comparable sales consummated through our customer-facing websites and mobile apps to grow in excess of 25% and store comps to be a low single-digit decrease to a relatively flat for the fourth quarter. 
As Steven mentioned earlier, this directionally follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and softer comps in stores. For the full year, we are modeling comparable sales to increase in a range of approximately 0.6% to 1.1%, including an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 40 basis points.
Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase approximately 0.7% to 2.7% in the fourth quarter. This results in a modeled full year consolidated net sales increase of approximately 1.4% to 1.9%. Our model includes an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 40 basis points for the fourth quarter and full year.
Assuming these sales levels, we continue to model gross profit deleverage as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter and full year. We also continue to model the full year gross margin deleverage to be less than it was in fiscal 2014. We are modeling SG&A deleverage for both the fourth quarter and full year, which includes increases in investments in compensation and benefits, advertising and technology-related expenses. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2015 is expected to be approximately $260 million. 
Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $83 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated to be in the mid-30s percentage range with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow. Capital expenditures in 2015 are now modeled to be approximately $350 million, subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects continue to represent a significant portion of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued installment of new equipment and systems in conjunction with the utilization of our new data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system.
Our model reflects completion of our current $2 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2015, at which time we plan to repurchase shares under our new $2.5 billion authorization, and we estimate that new program to be completed in fiscal 2019. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
We are modeling diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 160 million for the fourth quarter and approximately 165 million for the full year. We are modeling an unfavorable foreign currency rate -- exchange rate impact of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2015 based on a Canadian currency exchange rate for the fourth quarter of approximately CAD 1.38 to each U.S. dollar. This $0.06 estimate includes approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter.
Based upon these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.72 to $1.86 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year modeled net earnings per diluted share to a range of approximately $4.91 to $5.05.
Turning to fiscal 2016. While we are in the process of completing our annual budget, our preliminary modeling assumptions include the following: we expect to make continued investments in technology and in our omni-channel capabilities. We anticipate opening approximately 30 stores across all concepts and closing approximately 10 stores. We expect to continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
We anticipate interest expense of approximately $81 million, including the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. We expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rate. Our model reflects repurchases under our new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization with an assumed completion in fiscal 2019, and which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
We expect comparable sales growth from our customer-facing digital channels to continue to exceed comparable sales growth in stores. We will provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year of 2016 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2016. I'll now turn the call back to Steven."

All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today.  Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated January 7, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some key points from the press release. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.09, in line with the preliminary estimate of $1.07 to $1.10 provided in our December 22 press release. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of about 30 basis points over the prior year or 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales decreased approximately 40 basis points or were relatively flat on a constant currency basis. The company is modeling fiscal fourth quarter 2015 net earnings per diluted share of approximately $1.72 to $1.86, and is now modeling fiscal 2015 full year net earnings per diluted share of approximately $4.91 to $5.05.
I will now turn the call over to Steven for his perspective on our third quarter results. He will also discuss our operational results and the progress we've made on some of our strategic initiatives.

As we said, on",1475,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. As you see from our press release and consistent with our prior announcement on December 22, our performance in the third quarter reflects the recent retail trends we have been experiencing.  As we said, on the one hand, we experienced softer in-store transaction counts and on the other hand, sales from our customer-facing digital channels demonstrated strong growth in excess of 25%. These mixed results were against the backdrop of the overall softness reported in the macro retail environment during the quarter.
During the third quarter, we experienced a low single-digit percentage decline in our comparable sales consummated in stores. At the same time, in our customer-facing digital channels, we are pleased that we have seen continued growth in both number of visits to our selling websites as well as in the number of orders placed on both desktop and mobile. In our mobile channels, we set new record highs across all key performance indicators during the third quarter, including traffic, orders, sales, average order value and conversion. Mobile sales during the quarter increased more than 2.5x compared to the same period last year. These results directionally followed the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and softer comps in stores. As consumer shopping preferences continue to shift, we remain focused on providing a seamless customer experience across all of our retail channels so that our customers can interact with us however, wherever and whenever they choose.
In our December 22 press release, we anticipated comparable sales through Christmas to increase approximately 1%. Comparable sales from the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter through Christmas were actually slightly ahead of that plan. Sue will have more to say on our modeling assumptions for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year in a few minutes. 
As we said, the retail environment continues to evolve, and we are making investments throughout the company, including in the areas of information technology, marketing, analytics, merchandising and customer service to further our market-leading position in the categories for which we are best known, and to do even more for and with our customers. While we recognize that the investments we are making impact our operating profit in the short term, we believe our never say no culture and the strength of our balance sheet provide a strong foundation. And through the differentiated products, services and solutions we provide, we continue to further our efforts to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages.
While most pure play retailers who primarily sell merchandise and home-related categories are struggling with profitability and others rely on outside sources of capital to remain viable, our company generates healthy cash flows and our strong balance sheet enables us to make strategic investments necessary to continue to create a best-in-class, omni-channel platform to position us for long-term success. Some examples of recent enhancements to our website include a new feature for both desktop and mobile that enables customers to upload their own personal content such as images of how they have used products that other customers may view, enjoy and use them as inspiration. 
Also with regard to our website and apps, we have begun piloting a new solution for our customers to manage their Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY coupons and promotional offers in one place. My Offers is a virtual coupon wallet that organizes in-stores' print and digital coupons, includes the ability to scan and upload paper coupons, so customers can access and redeem them conveniently. We continue to learn from customer usage as we further develop the appropriate strategic implementation of this customer-centric solution.
Another new offering on the Bed Bath & Beyond website is the ability to personalize products using a monogram and etching or personal image on such items as towels, glassware, rugs and many other giftable items. Over time, we plan to expand the selection and assortment available for personalization. With regard to merchandising, we have introduced new categories and steadily expanded our assortment in others and will continue to do so. We currently have hundreds of thousands of SKUs available online and/or in-store. Our goal is both to increase our overall assortment as well as to continue to curate and present the right assortment to our customers. This requires the ongoing effort to review, edit, define and present our offerings based on feedback from our customers as well as the learnings from our merchant marketing and analytics teams.
Advancement in information technology further our efforts to connect with our customers across all of our retail channels. We continue to build on our omni-channel strategy by creating services and experiences that are seamless across our digital and physical channels. For example, we have enhanced our online registry experience this year to both wedding and back to college by expanding the ability for registrants and potential registrants to schedule an appointment with one of our expert consultants in their local store.  In addition, we have recently launched a social shopping feature that enables registrants to invite their family and friends to recommend items for their registries. 
Our service initiative this year also included the opening of our new customer contact center in October 2015. Located in Layton, Utah, this new contact center enables us to supplement our 24/7 East Coast contact center operations with additional high-quality service and support. We are committed to ever improving our customer experiences wherever, whenever and however our customers wish to interact with us.
This year in an effort to improve the efficiency and speed of delivery to our customers in conjunction with using our stores for fulfillment, we expanded the number of distribution facilities we have to 10, including our newest facility that opened earlier this year in Las Vegas. In addition, in the fall of 2016, we planned to open a new 800,000 square foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. We will continue to assess sites throughout the country for the potential to gain even greater distribution efficiencies.

The majority of the remaining increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales in order of magnitude was due to an increase in payroll and payroll-related items and an increase in advertising expense due in part to the growth in digital advertising.
Our tax rate for the third quarter 2015 was approximately 35.3% compared to approximately 32.3% in the third quarter of 2014. The third quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters of approximately $6.9 million this year as compared to approximately $16.7 million last year. This year-over-year unfavorable difference is approximately $0.06 based on this quarter's actual share count.  Considering all of this activity, including the unfavorable, noncomparable items totaling $0.11, which I just mentioned as well as approximately $0.02 from an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact in the third quarter of 2015, net earnings per diluted share were $1.09 for the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.23 for the third quarter of 2014, in line with the preliminary estimate we provided on December 22.
Turning to some highlights on the balance sheet. As of November 28, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $565 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $3.2 billion at cost. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for the 9 months of 2015 were approximately $244 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements, the new customer contact center, the new distribution facility in Las Vegas as well as other projects.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which was net of approximately $194 million, representing about 3.3 million shares repurchased during the period. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $110 million at the end of the third quarter and is now expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Upon completion of the current program, the company will begin to repurchase shares under its new $2.5 billion share repurchase program authorized in September 2015. As a reminder, our quarterly share repurchase activity may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.

For the full year, we are modeling comparable sales to increase in a range of approximately 0.6% to 1.1%, including an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 40 basis points.
Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase approximately 0.7% to 2.7% in the fourth quarter. This results in a modeled full year consolidated net sales increase of approximately 1.4% to 1.9%. Our model includes an unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of approximately 40 basis points for the fourth quarter and full year. Assuming these sales levels, we continue to model gross profit deleverage as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter and full year.

Our model reflects completion of our current $2 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2015, at which time we plan to repurchase shares under our new $2.5 billion authorization, and we estimate this new program to be completed in fiscal 2019. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
We are modeling diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 160 million for the fourth quarter and approximately 165 million for the full year. We are modeling an unfavorable foreign currency rate -- exchange rate impact of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2015 based on a Canadian currency exchange rate for the fourth quarter of approximately CAD 1.38 to each U.S. dollar. This $0.06 estimate includes approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter. Based upon these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.72 to $1.86 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year modeled net earnings per diluted share to a range of approximately $4.91 to $5.05.
Turning to fiscal 2016. While we are in the process of completing our annual budget, our preliminary modeling assumptions include the following: we expect to make continued investments in technology and in our omni-channel capabilities. We anticipate opening approximately 30 stores across all concepts and closing approximately 10 stores. We expect to continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
We anticipate interest expense of approximately $81 million, including the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. We expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rate. Our model reflects repurchases under our new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization with an assumed completion in fiscal 2019, and which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. We expect comparable sales growth from our customer-facing digital channels to continue to exceed comparable sales growth in stores. We will provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year of 2016 on our next quarterly conference call on April 6, 2016. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steven."

We are pleased to have completed another successful year. Our fiscal 2015 financial performance reflects the benefit of the significant investments in our business, steady progress on our strategic initiatives and the return of more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase. 
As Janet highlighted, we reported fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share of $5.10, including a $0.06 net benefit from certain nonrecurring items. Excluding this benefit, we were at $5.04, which marks the fourth year in a row that we've been in this $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. And we believe we can again achieve earnings per share at the high end of this range this year, and in the event our comp is higher than the 1% to 2% range we're modeling, exceed it.
Over the past few years, we have driven change throughout our organization to capitalize on advancing technologies. We have made tremendous progress in the transformation of our company to better serve our customers in an ever-evolving digital world. At the same time, our strategy remains rooted in our customer-centric culture and commitment to customer service; to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer.
Looking forward, we believe the dynamic and ever-changing retail environment presents a great opportunity for even greater success in the years ahead. The pace of change requires and rewards continuous innovation and the ability to adapt as technology advances and consumer preferences evolve. 
As a highly profitable market leader, we are committed to strengthening our business and making the strategic investments that will enable us to continue to do more for and with our customers. We are committed to becoming even more relevant to our existing customers and attracting new customers as they choose where, when and how to shop. 
With that in mind, I'd like to provide more details surrounding the technological developments impacting omnichannel retailing today and about the steps we've taken to transform our business, including a number of examples that demonstrate this in terms of where we've been, where we are and where we're going. 
I'll start with the evolution of our information technology group and our expanding capabilities. Where were we? Several years ago, our dedicated IT resources were much smaller and operated under a budget about 1/4 of the size it is now. Since then, these IT resources had increased by nearly 500 people, including addition of key members to our IT leadership team. Many of the additions have taken place within our digital technology group as we make further enhancements to and grow our digital footprint. 
Over the past several years, the IT group has upgraded or replaced the majority of our customer-facing and back end systems and introduced new systems to enable us to utilize new technology while also enhancing the security and redundancy of our systems. Today, members of our IT group are immersed in all aspects of the business as technology has become the backbone so many of our initiatives can do more for and with our customers.
Going forward, we will focus on better integration of our systems in order to achieve a more comprehensive view of our customers as they interact with us across multiple channels and provide a more personalized customer experience. The IT group will continue to partner across the organization to deliver new technology and innovation to take advantage of the opportunity that our enhanced tools can provide. Over the course of this call, I will cover a number of these initiatives.
Next, our digital web and mobile capabilities. Where were we? The opportunities presented by new technologies surpassed our older systems capabilities, making additional improvements to search, navigation and functionality more difficult. We also did not have mobile websites, applications in any of our concepts. 
Over the past several years, we have relaunched our customer-facing websites for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and created a new selling website to Christmas Tree Shops and apps. We now have mobile websites for all the concepts and have created apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY. 
We have continued to make improvements to the functionality, general search and navigation features across our customer-facing digital channels so that customers can find what they're looking for more quickly and efficiently. 
In addition, we've greatly expanded the functionality to allow us to personalized product vendor direct-to-consumer items, which I'll refer to as DDC, and product that utilizes less-than-truckload shipping, which I'll refer to as LTL such as furniture. 
We have also created new services and experiences for our customers such as online appointment scheduling for registry and a new virtual coupon wallet called My Offers, which organizes and stores print and digital coupons so customers can access and redeem them conveniently online or in-store. 
Going forward in fiscal 2016, bringing multiple software releases to provide additional enhancements to all of our digital experiences. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized customer experience across all of our retail channels. 
In addition, we'll be launching a new series of curated and inspirational merchandise collection where customers will be able to conveniently shop the look. We also plan to add more places on the web for customers to upload their own personal content such as images of how they have used our products so that other customers may use them as inspiration. Also, this year, we plan to relaunch our mobile apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and streamline our mobile websites to create better user experience and making them faster and easier to use.
Now let's turn to analytics. Where were we? We do not have a centralized analytics group, and our data house and disparate systems across the company as well as the third-party providers. Since the data was disconnected, we were limited in our ability to tie various interactions together or comprehensively slice and dice information in order to efficiently reach the desired insights. 
Today, we have a structured analytics department with robust quantitative capabilities. We have made significant investments to hire talented people, reengineer key business processes, build new systems and migrate, connect and consolidate all of our data into 1 central platform that we manage internally. 
We also augment our behavioral data with third-party demographic data to create an enhanced view of our customers. The analytics group is actively supporting many areas of our business, including merchandising, pricing, marketing, logistics, store operations and finance with meaningful advanced analytics, business intelligence and reporting to help drive enhanced performance and gain deep insights in how our customers interact with us across all our concepts, channels and countries in which we operate.
However, we're just scratching the surface in terms of how analytics can move our business forward. In the future, we will grow and extend the team's reach within the organization to provide valuable insights based on analysis and information from both external and internal systems. For example, further utilization of predictive modeling tools will enable us to achieve improved optimization to markdowns, pricing and direct mail campaigns. 
With our data initiatives, we will continue mapping customer interactions both in-store and through our various digital channels. This, in turn, allows us to get smarter about discerning and anticipating our customers' needs and providing inspiration and solutions and thus reinforcing that we know our customers and are the experts in the home. 
By leveraging our ever-expanding 360-degree view of the customer, we will further optimize targeting and tailoring techniques in marketing and enhance personalization both digitally and through traditional marketing media.
In merchandising, where were we? Well, as you know, our merchandising strategy was historically rooted in bed and bath. However, as we identified opportunities, we adopted our strategy and our name to meet the additional needs of our customers. In recognition of our expanding merchandise assortment within domestics and home furnishings, we added Beyond to our store name. 
Our acquisition of Harmon, Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY in '02, '03 and '07 gave us an opportunity to further differentiate our merchandise assortment and our ability to do more for and with our customers. Over the past several years, in addition to all of this merchandise being available online and in standalone stores, we have also created specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, food and beverage within our stores to increasingly showcase this differentiated merchandise. We have continued to expand, differentiate and improve our merchandising-related services and solutions internally through our teams, including product development and externally via acquisition. 
The acquisition of Cost Plus World Market in 2012 gave us another avenue into the growing food, beverage and furniture category. And the more recent Of a Kind acquisition in 2015 gives us an e-commerce platform geared towards millennials that offer specially commissioned, limited-edition items from up-and-coming artists and designers. 
Within Bed Bath & Beyond, we have exclusive or proprietary brands such Real Simple and Kenneth Cole Reaction Home, which enable us to provide differentiated merchandise across multiple product categories such as bedding, bath, storage, cleaning and dining. 
During fiscal 2015, we introduced additional proprietary brands within Bed Bath & Beyond, including soft.org and Studio 3B by Kyle More recently, we launched Artisanal Kitchen Supply, a collection of curated kitchen products. 
The increased functionality of our website has also produced and provided an opportunity for us to do more for and with our customers as we can now sell hundreds of thousands of items with the potential to sell millions of items that we did not sell previously and that we do not carry in our stores. With our capabilities to sell DDC and ship LTL, we have introduced new product categories such as mattresses, jewelry and furniture. Our assortment of outdoor and indoor furniture, which includes furnishing for baby's nursery, has increased significantly over the past year, which do see tremendous opportunity in the furniture and home decor categories and our plans to grow our assortment dramatically in the years to come. 
Consistent with this, we have also added resources, including associates and enhanced systems that will enable us to substantially increase the number of SKUs we can make available for sale in the categories where greater choice is valued by the customer. 
We have also been working to evolve the merchandise we carry and to improve the look and feel of our stores. An example is what we have done for our Christmas Trees Shops concept. We are excited to introduce our newest store to the Atlanta market later this month. We have designed this store to have local appeal and become the destination for customers to find an ever-changing mix of differentiated and closeout merchandise, spanning categories such as home decor, seasonal, food, entertaining essentials and gifts, all at a great value.
Going forward, growing our product offerings, including in furniture and home decor categories and differentiated products remains a focus for us. As our assortment grows, we will continue to review, refine and edit our offering to present the right assortment in the right manner to our customers. 
Another area of focus is solutions-based product. An increasing number of innovative products has come to market that provide the connected home experience, which enable remote access to smart home devices such as thermostat lighting and home security systems. Generally, we have introduced technology-related products with the numerous departments, including bedding, kitchen, health and wellness and baby and kids.
We believe Bed Bath & Beyond is uniquely suited to benefit from the solutions-based and technology-driven product because we have extremely talented merchants who work daily with our vendors and product development teams in connection with developing new and differentiated merchandise. Our customers have come to expect new and innovative products from us. We provide good value at the right price, and we provide a high level of customer service. We are always looking to develop and present products that make the lives of our customers easier and more enjoyable.
Moving on to marketing. Where were we? Historically, our marketing program consisted primarily of postcards, newspaper inserts and circulars that often included coupon offers. Our strategy targeted customers based on proximity to one of our stores and past coupon usage, plus our ability to understand our customers' shopping preferences, lifestyle and life stages was limited because our customer data was fragmented, housed in different places and difficult to navigate. 
Several years ago, recognizing the growing influence of the web on consumer purchasing behavior and engagement with our brand, we expanded our in-house marketing team, including experts in digital marketing. Today, we use a full range of online and off-line vehicles in our marketing efforts, including e-mail, text, paid search, SEO, social media, display and affiliate programs as well as traditional print media such as postcards and circulars. 
Through our enhanced analytics capabilities, we are just beginning to utilize sophisticated, predictive modeling based on hundreds of data points, including both observed and inferred shopping behaviors to drive a more customer-centric marketing strategy. 
Recently, we have begun to implement a new marketing campaign management system to better target our customers and drive personalization. For example, in buybuy BABY, we've been evolving our direct mail and e-mail contact strategies to include a more personalized approach based on a customer's prenatal or postnatal life stage. 
While we have significantly increased our digital marketing efforts, we have also modified our print campaigns. Last year, we piloted our first-ever print catalog for Bed Bath & Beyond introduce our online outdoor living collection. The book was distributed to a targeted group of customers that were identified using our predictive modeling tools as having a propensity to shop this product category. A digital version of the catalog was also available online. We were pleased with the results of this pilot and as a result, plan to produce 3 category-specific catalogs in fiscal 2016. 
Going forward, our team will continue to leverage analytics in order to optimize our marketing strategies as we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us. This will enable us to tailor our marketing communications and provide our customers with more personalized, timely and relevant information, thereby furthering our efforts to establish our brand as the experts of the home and the destination for our customers' needs and wants. 
Next, store operations and customer service. Where were we? While both have always been strengths of our organization, it starts with our people and the culture they create. We are extremely proud of our associates who work hard to provide a noticeably better shopping experience for our customers. 
However, we have the opportunity to improve the tools and technologies available to service our customers and be more productive. For example, our proprietary internal web-based platform called The Beyond Store, while initially ahead of its time, proved to have limitations as technology evolved. 
Our labor scheduling system and point-of-sale systems are also in need of updating. Our technology investments over the past several years included the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. During 2014 and 2015, we rolled out our new workforce management system to Bed Bath & Beyond stores and going forward, plan to roll it out to all other concepts. 
In 2015, we significantly upgraded the Beyond Store platform and integrated it with our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY selling websites and mobile channels, which give our associates more functionality such as the ability to create LTL orders, compare products and read product reviews. This new platform has been fully rolled out to our stores in Canada and will be rolled out to the rest of the United States Bed Bath & Beyond and BABY stores in 2016. 
During fiscal 2015, we also rolled out the new Beyond store platform through our customer contact teams and opened a new customer contact center in Layton, Utah to supplement our East Coast operation and enhance our 24/7 customer support. Our customer contact centers are an essential component of the high-quality service and support we strive to provide to all of our customers, regardless of whether they are interacting with us in the store, on the phone, on e-mail or in a live chat. During fiscal 2016, we will be making further enhancements to the systems in our customer contact centers to enable a more personalized experience.
As other retailers closed stores and consolidate their customer contact centers, we are investing and strengthening our position as the leader in customer service. Our best-in-class registry services for wedding, baby, college and other life events also provide a unique opportunity to deepen our customer relationships by demonstrating a high level of customer service during important life stages. 
As consumer preference has continued to evolve, it is imperative that we further enhance our reputation for providing best-in-class customer service. Going forward, we have initiatives to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. 
For example, at our new Liberty View project in Brooklyn, which will house 4 of our concepts, we are creating a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment. And we are further integrating our omnichannel capabilities to provide a more experiential shopping environment. 
When the store opens towards the end of this summer, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes. In addition, customers will be able to use our Scan for More digital tool to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews. 
Our interactive catalogs will enable customers to view our curated assortment of product such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items. And our digital product advisory tool will help customers find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs. We believe that this venue, including the revised layout of our stores, along with enhanced services we offer, will become a shopping destination where our customers can have a fun and productive shopping experience.
Also going forward, our associate mobility initiative for our stores utilizes various technology-enabled tools, including mobile devices to enable our associates to provide greater floor coverage and a more personalized customer experience. With a mobile device, associates can gain instant access to product information and content as well as place in-store orders via the Beyond store. 
In addition, our multiyear investment in the new point-of-sale system is also coming to fruition, and we plan to begin piloting it in fiscal 2016. Some benefits of the new system will include providing a more efficient customer checkout process by automating many manual processes as well as greatly enhancing our promotional capabilities such as opportunities for personalized coupon offers and potential loyalty programs. 
As importantly, the new point-of-sale system will provide the foundation for future enhancements and will allow for integration with the Beyond store as well as our web and mobile platforms. As shopping patterns continue to change, our physical channels will evolve, including the number of stores we have, their size and layout as well as their look and feel. These changes will reflect how customers utilize our stores, including for growing services such as reserve online, pick-up in store, returning items purchased online, scheduling appointments and interacting with our associates for registry and design services. 
Next, we have pricing. Where were we? We did not have a formal pricing team. Pricing decisions were made on a decentralized basis, and competitive prices were monitored manually through store visits and scanning retailer website. Over the past several years, with the expansion of pricing transparency throughout retail, we put a pricing team and new systems in place to track competitive pricing to maintain our competitive position within the market. 
The team has already begun to affect change based on more timely and relevant competitive pricing information. Going forward, the team will further develop dynamic pricing capabilities to enable us to better manage and optimize market pricing decisions in realtime. New systems will enhance our ability to set pricing, adjust pricing, react to competitive pricing and optimizing pricing for markdowns. We remain committed to offering our customers high-quality and differentiated products, services and solutions at the right value.
Let's turn to supply chain. Let's talk specifically about fulfillment to our customers. Since Bed Bath & Beyond essentially operated under a vendor direct-to-store model, we did not have any distribution facilities so we really had no way to ship product to customers from a warehouse. 
Since then, we have opened or gained through acquisition 10 retail distribution facilities that also built at a store network to ship to customers, including about 175 stores operating at regional fulfillment locations. In addition, we have made significant investments in developing more flexible fulfillment options for customer delivery and expanding our distribution facility network to support anticipated growth across all our channels. 
Our enhanced capabilities, including being able to ship LTL and parcel direct from vendors or from some of our distribution facilities. Further, we have enhanced our current warehouse manager systems with new labor management modules to create efficiencies and reduce delivery times. 
Going forward, we will continue to assess our supply chain network to better optimize it so as to improve our delivery times and achieve important cost savings. In keeping with this, in the fall, we will be opening a new 800,000-square-foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. This new facility will primarily fulfill online orders for all concepts and significantly improve our delivery capabilities. In addition, we are also working with various partners to pilot same-day delivery service in a limited number of markets.
Moving to real estate. Where were we? We've always conducted our real estate in-house and believe it to be another strong core competency. We have high standards for how we evaluate each real estate transaction and managed our portfolio in such a manner that the store layouts, sizes, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability.
Many years ago, we recognized that the retail landscape was changing, and we raised the bar in how we evaluate real estate opportunities. As such, we began taking a much more conservative view of the store performance potential from a four-wall sales perspective, essentially assuming reductions in store traffic and additional migration to digital channels. 
Today, our stores remain very profitable. And as the physical and digital retail channels become more integrated, we believe that having a physical presence in the market is and will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. 
As many retailers have announced store closures, we have been asked why we are not being more aggressive in closing stores. Our answer is, we do close stores. However, in almost all cases, we have made the right judgment and done the right transactions in the first place so that our stores are profitable and provide enormous benefit to our customers and our company. 
Our stores give us incredible opportunity to satisfy our customers and provide a noticeably better shopping experience. Our stores provide access to merchandise for immediate purchase or in-store pickup as well as access to knowledgeable store associates to answer product-specific questions to provide product recommendations, to assist with a return or of update a registry or executed the Beyond store order. 
The success of our nationwide network of more than 1,500 stores benefits our digital channels as well since having a strong physical presence in local markets creates a broad level of consumer awareness of our brand. Our physical presence in local markets keeps us top of mind as customers decide when and where they want to shop online. 
Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio and both open and close stores when it makes sense. We are opening stores in new markets. We are testing smaller store formats, and we are making our stores more experiential to further leverage the differentiated products, services and solutions we provide. Our stores will evolve in such a way that reflects how our customers are utilizing their products, services and solutions. 
Before wrapping up, let me say a few words about our institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group. We acquired this nonretail business back in 2012 in order to better leverage our combined expertise, product knowledge, distribution synergies and relationships; to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers. Since then, we've been laying the groundwork for growth, including strengthening the leadership team and integrating systems. We are pleased with our progress to date and will continue to invest in order to prepare for future growth. 
As we begin a new fiscal year, we remain committed to and focused on positioning Bed Bath & Beyond for long-term success. The opportunities are abundant: to do more, for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the experts of the home, including the accompanying life stages such as getting married, having a baby transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; and to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants that they express their life interests and travel through their life stages, all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. 
As our business transforms, we will navigate the competitive landscape and adapt as customer preferences evolve. We will utilize internal and external resources to attract the right people and have the right technologies and products to advance our strategy, all the while remaining disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve long-term profitability. Our healthy cash flows and strong balance sheet enable us to fund these investments and build upon our operational achievements while also returning value to our shareholders.
In recognition of our strong cash flow generation and confidence in our business, as well as to provide a more balanced approach to returning value to shareholders, our Board of Directors has today authorized a dividend program and declared its first quarterly dividend of $0.125 to be paid on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. In addition to the dividend, we will continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchase. Sue will provide more details in a few minutes.
For those of you who have followed our company for some time, you know that we've managed our business for the long term. Our focus has never been about being the biggest but has always been about being the best. Our focus has never been about optimizing short-term profitability but always about creating long-term prosperity. This has never been more true than it is today. We remain steadfast in making the correct investments for our long-term success. 
I will now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide some annual modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016 as well as some high-level comments regarding fiscal 2017. Sue?"
321778,321594898,957695,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7%",1444,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7% or 2.1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting an increase in the average transaction amount and a slight increase in the number of transactions. These results were at the upper end of the model range we provided back in January, which was between relatively flat and an increase of 2%. 
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 25% while comp sales from our stores were relatively flat. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 38.6%, down about 110 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin. Also contributing were increases in net direct-to-customer shipping expense and markdowns. For the year, the gross margin deleverage was less than it was in 2014, which is consistent with our model. 
SG&A for the fourth quarter was approximately 24% of net sales as compared to 23.8% last year. This increase as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, technology-related expenses including depreciation and advertising expense due in part to the growth in digital advertising, partially offset by a favorable net benefit of approximately 50 basis points from certain nonrecurring items, including a favorable state audit settlement.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $24.5 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36%, which was in line with our model assumptions back in January versus 37.4% last year. The tax rate decreased about 140 basis points as the current quarter includes about $7 million in discrete tax events versus $700,000 last year. 
As we had modeled, our unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact in the quarter was approximately $0.02 per diluted share. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 6.1% to $1.91 or $1.85 excluding the favorable net benefit from nonrecurring items of approximately $0.06.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $673 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.8 billion, up about 3.6%. This increase was due in part to an increase in inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, including the inventory associated with our recently opened Las Vegas distribution facility. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
CapEx for the year was approximately $328 million, relatively flat to last year and below our model of $350 million due to some of the anticipated spend for 2015 moving into 2016. A significant portion of the 2015 spend related to technology projects as well as new stores, existing store improvement, our new customer contact center in Utah and the new distribution facility in Las Vegas. 
We repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our stock during the fourth quarter. And as expected, we completed our $2 billion share repurchase program and began repurchasing shares under our new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization during the quarter. This new authorization was approved by the board in September 2015 and had a remaining balance of approximately $2.3 billion at the end of the year. Since 2004 through year-end 2015, the company has returned approximately $9.7 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases. So now let's turn to where we are going in 2016.
As we've indicated throughout this call, we are managing our business for the long term and making progress on our strategic initiatives. In keeping with this approach, I'd like to provide you with some full year modeling assumptions.
Comp sales increase of 1% to 2%, with total sales being about 90 basis points higher than the comp. Gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We do anticipate the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015. 
SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items: first, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility; second, in response to wage increases impacting the retail sector, we are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates; third, we are modeling store coverage to be consistent with the prior year to reflect the evolving nature of the services our stores provide. We are modeling the full year impact from these 3 payroll-related investments to be approximately $0.23 per diluted share; fourth, we expect to make further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. We are modeling the full year impact of these tech investments to be approximately $0.17 per diluted share. 
Additional assumptions for fiscal 2016 include: depreciation expense estimate of $290 million, net interest expense estimate of $80 million; full year tax rate estimate in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Opening approximately 30 new stores across all concepts, most of which are planned to open in new markets for our various concepts. We also plan to close about 15 stores. CapEx estimate of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which is subject to the timing and composition of projects and includes some carryover of projects from 2015 as I mentioned earlier. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include the continued deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our digital, web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the ongoing development and deployment of our new POS system. 
In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores as well as our program for renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
Also, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of this spending level. In addition to our newly authorized dividend program, we will continue to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. As a reminder, share repurchases may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As Steve said earlier, our earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. And we believe we can again achieve earnings per diluted share at the high end of this range this year, and in the event our comp is higher than the 1% to 2% range we're modeling, exceed it. 
We believe our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share, excluding one-time items, will have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have in previous years with the exception that the percent for the first quarter is anticipated to be somewhat lighter and for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. 
Looking to 2017, a 53-week year, as I said, we plan CapEx to be less than our 2016 peak estimate range as we spend for a few of our larger capital projects such as most of the equipment required for our new POS system will have been completed while still allowing for appropriate investments in areas critical to our future. 
We also plan to open new stores mostly in new markets and close stores as market dynamics dictate. Regarding capital allocation, today's announcement of the quarterly dividend program, we now anticipate the completion of a $2.5 billion share repurchase program will occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion date will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Before turning the call back over to Steve for some final remarks, please note that our next quarterly conference call will take place on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. At that time, we will review our first quarter results and provide an update on fiscal 2016 as well as answer some questions from the investment community. I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

Our earnings press release dated April 6, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.

We are pleased to have completed another successful year. Our fiscal 2015 financial performance reflects the benefit of the significant investments in our business, steady progress on our strategic initiatives and the return of more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase. 
As Janet highlighted, we reported fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share of $5.10, including a $0.06 net benefit from certain nonrecurring items. Excluding this benefit, we were at $5.04, which marks the fourth year in a row that we've been in this $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. And we believe we can again achieve earnings per share at the high end of this range this year, and in the event our comp is higher than the 1% to 2% range we're modeling, exceed it.
Over the past few years, we have driven change throughout our organization to capitalize on advancing technologies. We have made tremendous progress in the transformation of our company to better serve our customers in an ever-evolving digital world. At the same time, our strategy remains rooted in our customer-centric culture and commitment to customer service; to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home, such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages, all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer.
Looking forward, we believe the dynamic and ever-changing retail environment presents a great opportunity for even greater success in the years ahead. The pace of change requires and rewards continuous innovation and the ability to adapt as technology advances and consumer preferences evolve. 
As a highly profitable market leader, we are committed to strengthening our business and making the strategic investments that will enable us to continue to do more for and with our customers. We are committed to becoming even more relevant to our existing customers and attracting new customers as they choose where, when and how to shop. 
With that in mind, I'd like to provide more details surrounding the technological developments impacting omnichannel retailing today and about the steps we've taken to transform our business, including a number of examples that demonstrate this in terms of where we've been, where we are and where are we going. 
I'll start with the evolution of our information technology group and our expanding capabilities. Where were we? Several years ago, our dedicated IT resources were much smaller and operated under a budget about 1/4 of the size it is now. Since then, these IT resources had increased by nearly 500 people, including addition of key members to our IT leadership team. Many of the additions have taken place within our digital technology group as we make further enhancements to and grow our digital footprint. 
Over the past several years, the IT group has upgraded or replaced the majority of our customer-facing and back-end systems and introduced new systems to enable us to utilize new technology while also enhancing the security and redundancy of our systems. Today, members of our IT group are immersed in all aspects of the business as technology has become the backbone so many of our initiatives can do more for and with our customers.
Going forward, we will focus on better integration of our systems in order to achieve a more comprehensive view of our customers as they interact with us across multiple channels and provide a more personalized customer experience. The IT group will continue to partner across the organization to deliver new technology and innovation to take advantage of the opportunity that our enhanced tools can provide. Over the course of this call, I will cover a number of these initiatives.
Next, our digital web and mobile capabilities. Where were we? The opportunities presented by new technologies surpassed our older systems' capabilities, making additional improvements to search, navigation and functionality more difficult. We also do not have mobile websites or applications for any of our concepts. 
Over the past several years, we have relaunched our customer-facing websites for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and created a new selling website for Christmas Trees Shops andThat!. We now have mobile websites for all the concepts and have created apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY. 
We have continued to make improvements to the functionality, general search and navigation features across our customer-facing digital channels so that customers can find what they're looking for more quickly and efficiently. 
In addition, we've greatly expanded the functionality to allow us to the sale of personalized product, vendor direct-to-consumer items, which I'll refer to as VDC, and product that utilizes less-than-truckload shipping, which I'll refer to as LTL, such as furniture. 
We have also created new services and experiences for our customers such as online appointment scheduling for registry and a new virtual coupon wallet called My Offers, which organizes and stores print and digital coupons so customers can access and redeem them conveniently online or in-store. 
Going forward in fiscal 2016, bringing multiple software releases to provide additional enhancements to all of our digital experiences. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized customer experience across all of our retail channels. 
In addition, we'll be launching a new series of curated and inspirational merchandise collections where customers will be able to conveniently shop the look. We also plan to add more places on the web for customers to upload their own personal content such as images of how they have used our products so that other customers may use them as inspiration. Also this year, we plan to relaunch our mobile apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and streamline our mobile websites to create better user experience by making them faster and easier to use.
Now let's turn to analytics. Where were we? We do not have a centralized analytics group, and our data was to house in disparate systems across the company as well as the third-party providers. Since the data was disconnected, we were limited in our ability to tie various interactions together or comprehensively slice and dice information in order to efficiently reach the desired insights. 
Today, we have a structured analytics department with robust quantitative capabilities. We have made significant investments to hire talented people, re-engineer key business processes, build new systems and migrate, connect and consolidate all of our data into one central platform that we manage internally. 
We also augment our behavioral data with third-party demographic data to create an enhanced view of our customers. The analytics group is actively supporting many areas of our business, including merchandising, pricing, marketing, logistics, store operations and finance with meaningful advanced analytics, business intelligence and reporting to help drive enhanced performance and gain deep insights in how our customers interact with us across all our concepts, channels and countries in which we operate.
However, we're just scratching the surface in terms of how analytics can move our business forward. In the future, we will grow and extend the team's reach within the organization to provide valuable insights based on analysis and information from both external and internal systems. For example, further utilization of predictive modeling tools will enable us to achieve improved optimization to markdowns, pricing and direct mail campaigns. 
With our data initiatives, we will continue mapping customer interactions both in-store and through our various digital channels. This, in turn, allows us to get smarter about discerning and anticipating our customers' needs and providing inspiration and solutions and thus reinforcing that we know our customers and are the experts in the home. 
By leveraging our ever-expanding 360-degree view of the customer, we will further optimize targeting and tailoring techniques in marketing and enhance personalization both digitally and through traditional marketing media.
In merchandising, where were we? Well, as you know, our merchandising strategy was historically rooted in bed and bath. However, as we identified opportunities, we adopted our strategy and our name to meet the additional needs of our customers. In recognition of our expanding merchandise assortment within domestics and home furnishings, we added Beyond to our store name. 
Our acquisitions of Harmon, Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY in '02, '03 and '07 gave us an opportunity to further differentiate our merchandise assortment and our ability to do more for and with our customers. Over the past several years, in addition to all of this merchandise being available online and in stand-alone stores, we have also created specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, food and beverage within our stores to increasingly showcase this differentiated merchandise. We have continued to expand, differentiate and improve our merchandising-related services and solutions internally through our teams, including product development and externally via acquisition. 
The acquisition of Cost Plus World Market in 2012 gave us another avenue into the growing food, beverage and furniture categories. And the more recent Of a Kind acquisition in 2015 gives us an e-commerce platform geared towards millennials that offer specially commissioned, limited-edition items from up-and-coming artists and designers. 
Within Bed Bath & Beyond, we have exclusive or proprietary brands such as Wamsutta, Real Simple and Kenneth Cole Reaction Home, which enable us to provide differentiated merchandise across multiple product categories such as bedding, bath, storage, cleaning and dining. 
During fiscal 2015, we introduced additional proprietary brands within Bed Bath & Beyond, including SALT, 
.ORG and Studio 3B by Kyle Schuneman. More recently, we launched Artisanal Kitchen Supply, a collection of curated kitchen products. 
The increased functionality of our website has also produced and provided an opportunity for us to do more for and with our customers as we can now sell hundreds of thousands of items with the potential to sell millions of items that we did not sell previously and that we do not carry in our stores. With our capabilities to sell VDC and ship LTL, we have introduced new product categories such as mattresses, jewelry and furniture. Our assortment of outdoor and indoor furniture, which includes furnishing for baby's nursery, has increased significantly over the past year. We do see tremendous opportunity in the furniture and home decor categories and our plans to grow our assortment dramatically in the years to come. 
Consistent with this, we have also added resources, including associates and enhanced systems that will enable us to substantially increase the number of SKUs we can make available for sale in the categories where greater choice is valued by the customer. 
We have also been working to evolve the merchandise we carry and to improve the look and feel of our stores. An example is what we have done for our Christmas Trees Shops concept. We are excited to introduce our newest andThat! store to the Kennesaw, Atlanta market later this month. We have designed this store to have local appeal and to become the destination for customers to find an ever-changing mix of differentiated and close-out merchandise, spanning categories such as home decor, seasonal, food, entertaining essentials and gifts, all at a great value.
Going forward, growing our product offerings, including in furniture and home decor categories and differentiated products, remains a focus for us. As our assortment grows, we will continue to review, refine and edit our offerings to present the right assortment in the right manner to our customers. 
Another area of focus is solutions-based product. An increasing number of innovative products have come to market that provide the connected home experience, which enable remote access to smart home devices such as thermostat lighting and home security systems. Generally, we have introduced technology-related products within numerous departments, including bedding, kitchen, health and wellness and baby and kids.
We believe Bed Bath & Beyond is uniquely suited to benefit from the solutions-based and technology-driven product because we have extremely talented merchants who work daily with our vendors and product development teams in connection with developing new and differentiated merchandise. Our customers have come to expect new and innovative products from us. We provide good value at the right price, and we provide a high level of customer service. We are always looking to develop and present products that make the lives of our customers easier and more enjoyable.
Moving on to marketing. Where were we? Historically, our marketing program consisted primarily of postcards, newspaper inserts and circulars that often included coupon offers. Our strategy targeted customers based on proximity to one of our stores and past coupon usage, plus our ability to understand our customers' shopping preferences, lifestyles and life stages was limited because our customer data was fragmented, housed in different places and difficult to navigate. 
Several years ago, recognizing the growing influence of the web on consumer purchasing behavior and engagement with our brands, we expanded our in-house marketing team, including experts in digital marketing. Today, we use a full range of online and off-line vehicles in our marketing efforts, including e-mail, text, paid search, SEO, social media, display and affiliate programs as well as traditional print media such as postcards and circulars. 
Through our enhanced analytics capabilities, we are just beginning to utilize sophisticated, predictive modeling based on hundreds of data points, including both observed and inferred shopping behaviors to drive a more customer-centric marketing strategy. 
Recently, we have begun to implement a new marketing campaign management system to better target our customers and drive personalization. For example, in buybuy BABY, we've been evolving our direct mail and e-mail contact strategies to include a more personalized approach based on a customer's prenatal or postnatal life stage. 
While we have significantly increased our digital marketing efforts, we have also modified our print campaigns. Last year, we piloted our first-ever print catalog for Bed Bath & Beyond introduced our online outdoor living collection. The book was distributed to a targeted group of customers that were identified using our predictive modeling tools as having a propensity to shop this product category. A digital version of the catalog was also available online. We were pleased with the results of this pilot and, as a result, plan to produce 3 category-specific catalogs in fiscal 2016. 
Going forward, our team will continue to leverage analytics in order to optimize our marketing strategies as we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us. This will enable us to tailor our marketing communications and provide our customers with more personalized, timely and relevant information, thereby furthering our efforts to establish our brand as the experts of the home and the destination for our customers' needs and wants. 
Next, store operations and customer service. Where were we? While both have always been strengths of our organization, it starts with our people and the culture they create. We are extremely proud of our associates who work hard to provide a noticeably better shopping experience for our customers. 
However, we have the opportunity to improve the tools and technologies available to service our customers and be more productive. For example, a proprietary internal web-based platform called The Beyond Store, while initially ahead of its time, proved to have limitations as technology evolved. 
Our labor scheduling system and point-of-sale systems are also in need of updating. Our technology investments over the past several years included the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. During 2014 and 2015, we rolled out our new workforce management system to Bed Bath & Beyond stores and going forward, plan to roll it out to all other concepts. 
In 2015, we significantly upgraded the Beyond Store platform and integrated it with our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY selling websites and mobile channels, which give our associates more functionality such as the ability to create LTL orders, compare products and read product reviews. This new platform has been fully rolled out to our stores in Canada and will be rolled out to the rest of the United States' Bed bath & Beyond and BABY stores in 2016. 
During fiscal 2015, we also rolled out the new Beyond store platform through our customer contact teams and opened a new customer contact center in Layton, Utah, to supplement our East Coast operation and enhance our 24/7 customer support. Our customer contact centers are an essential component of the high-quality service and support we strive to provide to all of our customers, regardless of whether they are interacting with us in the store, on the phone, on e-mail or in a live chat. During fiscal 2016, we will be making further enhancements to the systems in our customer contact centers to enable a more personalized experience.
As other retailers closed stores and consolidate their customer contact centers, we are investing and strengthening our position as the leader in customer service. Our best-in-class registry services for wedding, baby, college and other life events also provide a unique opportunity to deepen our customer relationships by demonstrating a high level of customer service during important life stages. 
As consumer preference has continued to evolve, it is imperative that we further enhance our reputation for providing best-in-class customer service. Going forward, we have initiatives to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. 
For example, at our new Liberty View project in Brooklyn, which will house 4 of our concepts, we are creating a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment. And we are further integrating our omnichannel capabilities to provide a more experiential shopping environment. 
When the store opens towards the end of this summer, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes. In addition, customers will be able to use our Scan for More digital tool to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews. 
Our interactive catalogs will enable customers to view a curated assortment of product such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items. And our digital product advisory tool will help customers find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs. We believe that this venue, including the revised layout of our stores, along with enhanced services we offer, will become a shopping destination where our customers can have a fun and productive shopping experience.
Also going forward, our associate mobility initiative for our stores utilizes various technology-enabled tools, including mobile devices to enable our associates to provide greater floor coverage and a more personalized customer experience. With a mobile device, associates can gain instant access to product information and content as well as placed in-store orders via the Beyond store. 
In addition, our multiyear investment in the new point-of-sale system is also coming to fruition, and we plan to begin piloting it in fiscal 2016. Some benefits of the new system will include providing a more efficient customer checkout process by automating many manual processes as well as greatly enhancing our promotional capabilities such as opportunities for personalized coupon offers and potential loyalty programs. 
As importantly, the new point for sale system will provide the foundation for future enhancements and will allow for integration with the Beyond store as well as our web and mobile platforms. As shopping patterns continue to change, our physical channels will evolve, including the number of stores we have, their size and layout as well as their look and feel. These changes will reflect how customers utilize our stores, including for growing services such as reserve online, pick-up in store, returning items purchased online, scheduling appointments and interacting with our associates for registry and design services. 
Next, we have pricing. Where were we? We did not have a formal pricing team. Pricing decisions were made on a decentralized basis, and competitive prices were monitored manually through store visits and scanning retailer websites. Over the past several years, with the expansion of pricing transparency throughout retail, we put a pricing team and new systems in place to track competitive pricing to maintain our competitive position within the market. 
The team has already begun to affect change based on more timely and relevant competitive pricing information. Going forward, the team will further develop dynamic pricing capabilities to enable us to better manage and optimize market pricing decisions in realtime. New systems will enhance our ability to set pricing, adjust pricing, react to competitive pricing and optimizing pricing for markdowns. We remain committed to offering our customers high-quality and differentiated products, services and solutions at the right value.
Let's turn to supply chain. Let's talk specifically about fulfillment to our customers. Since Bed Bath & Beyond essentially operated under a vendor direct-to-store model, we did not have any distribution facilities. So we really had no way to ship product to customers from a warehouse. 
Since then, we have opened or gained through acquisition 10 retail distribution facilities that also built out a store network to ship to customers, including about 175 stores operating at regional fulfillment locations. In addition, we have made significant investments in developing more flexible fulfillment options for customer delivery and expanding our distribution facility network to support anticipated growth across all our channels. 
Our enhanced capabilities, including being able to ship LTL and parcel direct from vendors or from some of our distribution facilities. Further, we have enhanced our current warehouse manager systems with new labor management modules to create efficiencies and reduce delivery times. 
Going forward, we will continue to assess our supply chain network to better optimize it so as to improve our delivery times and achieve important cost savings. In keeping with this, in the fall, we will be opening a new 800,000 square foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. This new facility will primarily fulfill online orders for all concepts and significantly improve our delivery capabilities. In addition, we are also working with various partners to pilot same-day delivery service in a limited number of markets.
Moving to real estate. Where were we? We've always conducted our real estate in-house and believe it to be another strong core competency. We have high standards for how we evaluate each real estate transaction and managed our portfolio in such a manner that the mid-store layouts, sizes, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability.
Many years ago, we recognized that the retail landscape was changing, and we raised the bar in how we evaluate real estate opportunities. As such, we began taking a much more conservative view of the store performance potential from a four-wall sales perspective, essentially assuming reductions in store traffic and additional migration to digital channels. 
Today, our stores remain very profitable. And as the physical and digital retail channels become more integrated, we believe that having a physical presence in the market is and will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. 
As many retailers have announced store closures, we have been asked why we are not being more aggressive in closing stores. Our answer is, we do close stores. However, in almost all cases, we have made the right judgment and done the right transactions in the first place so that our stores are profitable and provide enormous benefit to our customers and our company. 
Our stores give us incredible opportunity to satisfy our customers and provide a noticeably better shopping experience. Our stores provide access to merchandise for immediate purchase or in-store pickup as well as access to knowledgeable store associates to answer product-specific questions to provide product recommendations, to assist with a return or of update a registry or execute the Beyond store order. 
The success of our nationwide network of more than 1,500 stores benefits our digital channels as well since having a strong physical presence in local markets creates a broad level of consumer awareness of our brand. Our physical presence in local markets keeps us top of mind as customers decide when and where they want to shop online. 
Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio and both open and close stores when it makes sense. We are opening stores in new markets. We are testing smaller store formats, and we are making our stores more experiential to further leverage the differentiated products, services and solutions we provide. Our stores will evolve in such a way that reflects how our customers are utilizing their products, services and solutions. 
Before wrapping up, let me say a few words about our institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group. We acquired this nonretail business back in 2012 in order to better leverage our combined expertise, product knowledge, distribution synergies and relationships; to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers. Since then, we've been laying the groundwork for growth, including strengthening the leadership team and integrating systems. We are pleased with our progress to date and will continue to invest in order to prepare for future growth. 
As we begin a new fiscal year, we remain committed to and focused on positioning Bed Bath & Beyond for long-term success. The opportunities are abundant: to do more, for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the experts of the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home such as getting married, having a baby transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; and to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants that they express their life interests and travel through their life stages, all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. 
As our business transforms, we will navigate the competitive landscape and adapt as customer preferences evolve. We will utilize internal and external resources to attract the right people and have the right technologies and products to advance our strategy, all the while remaining disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve long-term profitability. Our healthy cash flows and strong balance sheet enable us to fund these investments and build upon our operational achievements while also returning value to our shareholders.
In recognition of our strong cash flow generation and confidence in our business, as well as to provide a more balanced approach to returning value to shareholders, our Board of Directors has today authorized a dividend program and declared its first quarterly dividend of $0.125 to be paid on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. In addition to the dividend, we will continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchase. Sue will provide more details in a few minutes.
For those of you who have followed our company for some time, you know that we've managed our business for the long term. Our focus has never been about being the biggest but has always been about being the best. Our focus has never been about optimizing short-term profitability but always about creating long-term prosperity. This has never been more true than it is today. We remain steadfast in making the correct investments for our long-term success. 
I will now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide some annual modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016 as well as some high-level comments regarding fiscal 2017. Sue?"
321778,321594898,957710,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7%",1445,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7% or 2.1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting an increase in the average transaction amount and a slight increase in the number of transactions. These results were at the upper end of the model range we provided back in January, which was between relatively flat and an increase of 2%. 
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 25% while comp sales from our stores were relatively flat. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 38.6%, down about 110 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin. Also contributing were increases in net direct-to-customer shipping expense and markdowns. For the year, the gross margin deleverage was less than it was in 2014, which is consistent with our model. 
SG&A for the fourth quarter was approximately 24% of net sales as compared to 23.8% last year. This increase as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, technology-related expenses including depreciation and advertising expense due in part to the growth in digital advertising, partially offset by a favorable net benefit of approximately 50 basis points from certain nonrecurring items, including a favorable state audit settlement.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $24.5 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36%, which was in line with our model assumptions back in January versus 37.4% last year. The tax rate decreased about 140 basis points as the current quarter includes about $7 million in discrete tax events versus $700,000 last year. 
As we had modeled, our unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact in the quarter was approximately $0.02 per diluted share. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 6.1% to $1.91 or $1.85 excluding the favorable net benefit from nonrecurring items of approximately $0.06.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $673 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.8 billion, up about 3.6%. This increase was due in part to an increase in inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, including the inventory associated with our recently opened Las Vegas distribution facility. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
CapEx for the year was approximately $328 million, relatively flat to last year and below our model of $350 million due to some of the anticipated spend for 2015 moving into 2016. A significant portion of the 2015 spend related to technology projects as well as new stores, existing store improvement, our new customer contact center in Utah and the new distribution facility in Las Vegas. 
We repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our stock during the fourth quarter. And as expected, we completed our $2 billion share repurchase program and began repurchasing shares under our new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization during the quarter. This new authorization was approved by the board in September 2015 and had a remaining balance of approximately $2.3 billion at the end of the year. Since 2004 through year-end 2015, the company has returned approximately $9.7 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases. So now let's turn to where we are going in 2016.
As we've indicated throughout this call, we are managing our business for the long term and making progress on our strategic initiatives. In keeping with this approach, I'd like to provide you with some full year modeling assumptions.
Comp sales increase of 1% to 2%, with total sales being about 90 basis points higher than the comp. Gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We do anticipate the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015. 
SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items. First, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas, distribution facility. Second, in response to wage increases impacting the retail sector, we are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates. Third, we are modeling store coverage to be consistent with the prior year to reflect the evolving nature of the services our stores provide. We are modeling the full year impact from these 3 payroll-related investments to be approximately $0.23 per diluted share. Fourth, we expect to make further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. We are modeling the full year impact of these tech investments to be approximately $0.17 per diluted share. 
Additional assumptions for fiscal 2016 include: depreciation expense estimate of $290 million, net interest expense estimate of $80 million; full year tax rate estimate in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Opening approximately 30 new stores across all concepts, most of which are planned to open in new markets for our various concepts. We also plan to close about 15 stores. CapEx estimate of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which are subject to the timing and composition of projects and includes some carryover of projects from 2015, as I mentioned earlier. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include the continued deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our digital, web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the ongoing development and deployment of our new POS system. 
In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas, and new stores as well as our program for renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
Also, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of this spending level. In addition to our newly authorized dividend program, we will continue to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. As a reminder, share repurchases may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As Steve said earlier, our earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. And we believe we can again achieve earnings per diluted share at the high end of this range this year. And in the event our comp is higher than the 1% to 2% range we're modeling, exceed it. 
We believe our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share, excluding onetime items, will have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have in previous years with the exception that the percent for the first quarter is anticipated to be somewhat lighter and for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. 
Looking to 2017, our 53-week year, as I said, we plan CapEx to be less than our 2016 peak estimate range as the spend for a few of our larger capital projects such as most of the equipment required for our new POS system will have been completed while still allowing for appropriate investments in areas critical to our future. 
We also plan to open new stores mostly in new markets and close stores as market dynamics dictate. Regarding capital allocation, with today's announcement of the quarterly dividend program, we now anticipate the completion of a $2.5 billion share repurchase program will occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion date will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Before turning the call back over to Steve for some final remarks, please note that our next quarterly conference call will take place on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. At that time, we will review our first quarter results and provide an update on fiscal 2016 as well as answer some questions from the investment community.
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

As Janet highlighted, we reported fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share of $5.10, including a $0.06 net benefit from certain nonrecurring items. Excluding this benefit, we were at $5.04, which marks the fourth year in a row that we've been in this $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. And we believe we can again achieve earnings per share at the high end of this range this year, and in the event our comp is higher than the 1% to 2% range we're modeling, exceed it.
Over the past few years, we have driven change throughout our organization to capitalize on advancing technologies. We have made tremendous progress in the transformation of our company to better serve our customers in an ever-evolving digital world. At the same time, our strategy remains rooted in our customer-centric culture and commitment to customer service; to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home, such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages, all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer.
Looking forward, we believe the dynamic and ever-changing retail environment presents a great opportunity for even greater success in the years ahead. The pace of change requires and rewards continuous innovation and the ability to adapt as technology advances and consumer preferences evolve. 
As a highly profitable market leader, we are committed to strengthening our business and making the strategic investments that will enable us to continue to do more for and with our customers. We are committed to becoming even more relevant to our existing customers and attracting new customers as they choose where, when and how to shop. 
With that in mind, I'd like to provide more details surrounding the technological developments impacting omnichannel retailing today and about the steps we've taken to transform our business, including a number of examples that demonstrate this in terms of where we've been, where we are and where we're going. 
I'll start with the evolution of our information technology group and our expanding capabilities. Where were we? Several years ago, our dedicated IT resources were much smaller and operated under a budget about 1/4 of the size it is now. Since then, these IT resources had increased by nearly 500 people, including addition of key members to our IT leadership team. Many of the additions have taken place within our digital technology group as we make further enhancements to and grow our digital footprint. 
Over the past several years, the IT group has upgraded or replaced the majority of our customer-facing and back-end systems and introduced new systems to enable us to utilize new technology while also enhancing the security and redundancy of our systems. Today, members of our IT group are immersed in all aspects of the business as technology has become the backbone so many of our initiatives can do more for and with our customers.
Going forward, we will focus on better integration of our systems in order to achieve a more comprehensive view of our customers as they interact with us across multiple channels and provide a more personalized customer experience. The IT group will continue to partner across the organization to deliver new technology and innovation to take advantage of the opportunity that our enhanced tools can provide. Over the course of this call, I will cover a number of these initiatives.
Next, our digital web and mobile capabilities. Where were we? The opportunities presented by new technologies surpassed our older systems' capabilities, making additional improvements to search, navigation and functionality more difficult. We also do not have mobile websites' applications for any of our concepts. 
For the past several years, we have relaunched our customer-facing websites for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and created a new selling website for Christmas Tree Shops andThat!. We now have mobile websites for all the concepts and have created apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY. 
We have continued to make improvements to the functionality, general search and navigation features across our customer-facing digital channels so that customers can find what they're looking for more quickly and efficiently. 
In addition, we've greatly expanded the functionality to allow us for the sale of personalized product, vendor direct-to-consumer items, which I'll refer to as VDC, and product that utilizes less-than-truckload shipping, which I'll refer to as LTL, such as furniture. 
We have also created new services and experiences for our customers such as online appointment scheduling for registry and a new virtual coupon wallet called My Offers, which organizes and stores print and digital coupons so customers can access and redeem them conveniently, online or in-store. 
Going forward in fiscal 2016, bringing multiple software releases to provide additional enhancements to all of our digital experiences. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized customer experience across all of our retail channels. 
In addition, we'll be launching a new series of curated and inspirational merchandise collections where customers will be able to conveniently shop the look. We also plan to add more places on the web for customers to upload their own personal content such as images of how they have used our products so that other customers may use them as inspiration. Also this year, we plan to relaunch our mobile apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and streamline our mobile websites to create a better user experience by making them faster and easier to use.
Now let's turn to analytics. Where were we? We do not have a centralized analytics group, and our data was to house in disparate systems across the company as well as the third-party providers. Since the data was disconnected, we were limited in our ability to tie various interactions together or comprehensively slice and dice information in order to efficiently reach the desired insights. 
Today, we have a structured analytics department with robust quantitative capabilities. We have made significant investments to hire talented people, re-engineer key business processes, build new systems and migrate, connect and consolidate all of our data into one central platform that we manage internally. 
We also augment our behavioral data with third-party demographic data to create an enhanced view of our customers. The analytics group is actively supporting many areas of our business, including merchandising, pricing, marketing, logistics, store operations and finance with meaningful advanced analytics, business intelligence and reporting to help drive enhanced performance and gain deep insights in how our customers interact with us across all our concepts, channels and countries in which we operate.
However, we're just scratching the surface in terms of how analytics can move our business forward. In the future, we will grow and extend the team's reach within the organization to provide valuable insights based on analysis and information from both external and internal systems. For example, further utilization of predictive modeling tools will enable us to achieve improved optimization to markdowns, pricing and direct mail campaigns. 
With our data initiatives, we will continue mapping customer interactions both in-store and through our various digital channels. This, in turn, allows us to get smarter about discerning and anticipating our customers' needs and providing inspiration and solutions and thus reinforcing that we know our customers and are the experts in the home. 
By leveraging our ever-expanding 360-degree view of the customer, we will further optimize targeting and tailoring techniques in marketing and enhance personalization both digitally and through traditional marketing media.
In merchandising, where were we? Well, as you know, our merchandising strategy was historically rooted in bed and bath. However, as we identified opportunities, we adopted our strategy and our name to meet the additional needs of our customers. In recognition of our expanding merchandise assortment within domestics and home furnishings, we added Beyond to our store name. 
Our acquisitions of Harmon, Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY in '02, '03 and '07 gave us an opportunity to further differentiate our merchandise assortment and our ability to do more for and with our customers. Over the past several years, in addition to all of this merchandise being available online and in stand-alone stores, we have also created specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, food and beverage within our stores to increasingly showcase this differentiated merchandise. We have continued to expand, differentiate and improve our merchandising-related services and solutions internally through our teams, including product development and externally via acquisition. 
The acquisition of Cost Plus World Market in 2012 gave us another avenue into the growing food, beverage and furniture categories. And the more recent Of a Kind acquisition in 2015 gives us an e-commerce platform geared towards millennials that offer specially commissioned, limited-edition items from up-and-coming artists and designers. 
Within Bed Bath & Beyond, we have exclusive or proprietary brands such as Wamsutta, Real Simple and Kenneth Cole Reaction Home, which enable us to provide differentiated merchandise across multiple product categories such as bedding, bath, storage, cleaning and dining. 
During fiscal 2015, we introduced additional proprietary brands within Bed Bath & Beyond, including SALT, 
.ORG and Studio 3B by Kyle Schuneman. More recently, we launched Artisanal Kitchen Supply, a collection of curated kitchen products. 
The increased functionality of our website has also produced and provided an opportunity for us to do more for and with our customers as we can now sell hundreds of thousands of items with the potential to sell millions of items that we did not sell previously and that we do not carry in our stores. With our capabilities to sell VDC and ship LTL, we have introduced new product categories such as mattresses, jewelry and furniture. Our assortment of outdoor and indoor furniture, which includes furniture for a baby's nursery, has increased significantly over the past year. We do see tremendous opportunity in the furniture and home decor categories and our plans to grow our assortment dramatically in the years to come. 
Consistent with this, we have also added resources, including associates and enhanced systems that will enable us to substantially increase the number of SKUs we can make available for sale in the categories where greater choice is valued by the customer. 
We have also been working to evolve the merchandise we carry and to improve the look and feel of our stores. An example is what we have done for our Christmas Tree Shops andThat! concept. We are excited to introduce our newest andThat! store to the Kennesaw, Atlanta market later this month. We have designed this store to have local appeal and to become the destination for customers to find an ever-changing mix of differentiated and closed-out merchandise, spanning categories such as home decor, seasonal, food, entertaining essentials and gifts, all at a great value.
Going forward, growing our product offerings, including in furniture and home decor categories and differentiated products, remains a focus for us. As our assortment grows, we will continue to review, refine and edit our offerings to present the right assortment in the right manner to our customers. 
Another area of focus is solutions-based product. An increasing number of innovative products have come to market that provide the connected home experience, which enable remote access to smart home devices such as thermostats, lighting and home security systems. Generally, we have introduced technology-related products within numerous departments, including bedding, kitchen, health and wellness and baby and kids.
We believe Bed Bath & Beyond is uniquely suited to benefit from the solutions-based and technology-driven product because we have extremely talented merchants who work daily with our vendors and product development teams in connection with developing new and differentiated merchandise. Our customers have come to expect new and innovative products from us. We provide good value at the right price, and we provide a high level of customer service. We are always looking to develop and present products that make the lives of our customers easier and more enjoyable.
Moving on to marketing. Where were we? Historically, our marketing program consisted primarily of postcards, newspaper inserts and circulars that often included coupon offers. Our strategy targeted customers based on proximity to one of our stores and past coupon usage, plus our ability to understand our customers' shopping preferences, lifestyles and life stages was limited because our customer data was fragmented, housed in different places and difficult to navigate. 
Several years ago, recognizing the growing influence of the web on consumer purchasing behavior and engagement with our brands, we expanded our in-house marketing team, including experts in digital marketing. Today, we use a full range of online and off-line vehicles in our marketing efforts, including e-mail, text, paid search, SEO, social media, display and affiliate programs as well as traditional print media such as postcards and circulars. 
Through our enhanced analytics capabilities, we are just beginning to utilize sophisticated, predictive modeling based on hundreds of data points, including both observed and inferred shopping behaviors to drive a more customer-centric marketing strategy. 
Recently, we have begun to implement a new marketing campaign management system to better target our customers and drive personalization. For example, in buybuy BABY, we've been evolving our direct mail and e-mail contact strategies to include a more personalized approach based on a customer's prenatal or postnatal life stage. 
While we have significantly increased our digital marketing efforts, we have also modified our print campaigns. Last year, we piloted our first-ever print catalog for Bed Bath & Beyond, introduced our online outdoor living collection. The book was distributed to a targeted group of customers that were identified using our predictive modeling tools as having a propensity to shop this product category. A digital version of the catalog was also available online. We were pleased with the results of this pilot and, as a result, plan to produce 3 category-specific catalogs in fiscal 2016. 
Going forward, our team will continue to leverage analytics in order to optimize our marketing strategies as we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us. This will enable us to tailor our marketing communications and provide our customers with more personalized, timely and relevant information, thereby furthering our efforts to establish our brand as the experts of the home and the destination for our customers' needs and wants. 
Next, store operations and customer service. Where were we? While both have always been strengths of our organization, it starts with our people and the culture they create. We are extremely proud of our associates who work hard to provide a noticeably better shopping experience for our customers. 
However, we have the opportunity to improve the tools and technologies available to service our customers and be more productive. For example, a proprietary internal web-based platform called The Beyond Store, while initially ahead of its time, proved to have limitations as technology evolved. 
Our labor scheduling system and point-of-sale systems are also in need of updating. Our technology investments over the past several years included the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. During 2014 and 2015, we rolled out our new workforce management system to Bed Bath & Beyond stores and going forward, plan to roll it out to all other concepts. 
In 2015, we significantly upgraded the Beyond Store platform and integrated it with our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY selling websites and mobile channels, which give our associates more functionality such as the ability to create LTL orders, compare products and read product reviews. This new platform has been fully rolled out to our stores in Canada and will be rolled out to the rest of the United States' Bed Bath & Beyond and BABY stores in 2016. 
During fiscal 2015, we also rolled out the new Beyond store platform through our customer contact teams and opened a new customer contact center in Layton, Utah, to supplement our East Coast operations and enhance our 24/7 customer support. Our customer contact centers are an essential component of the high-quality service and support we strive to provide to all of our customers, regardless of whether they are interacting with us in the store, on the phone, on e-mail or in a live chat. During fiscal 2016, we will be making further enhancements to the systems in our customer contact centers to enable a more personalized experience.
As other retailers closed stores and consolidate their customer contact centers, we are investing and strengthening our position as the leader in customer service. Our best-in-class registry services for wedding, baby, college and other life events also provide a unique opportunity to deepen our customer relationships by demonstrating a high level of customer service during important life stages. 
As consumer preference has continued to evolve, it is imperative that we further enhance our reputation for providing best-in-class customer service. Going forward, we have initiatives to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. 
For example, at our new Liberty View project in Brooklyn, which will house 4 of our concepts, we are creating a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment. And we are further integrating our omnichannel capabilities to provide a more experiential shopping environment. 
When the store opens towards the end of this summer, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes. In addition, customers will be able to use our Scan for More digital tool to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews. 
Our interactive catalogs will enable customers to view a curated assortment of products such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items. And our digital product advisory tool will help customers find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs. We believe that this venue, including the revised layout of our stores, along with enhanced services we offer, will become a shopping destination where our customers can have a fun and productive shopping experience.
Also going forward, our associate mobility initiative for our stores utilizes various technology-enabled tools, including mobile devices to enable our associates to provide greater floor coverage and a more personalized customer experience. With a mobile device, associates can gain instant access to product information and content as well as place in-store orders via the Beyond store. 
In addition, our multiyear investment in the new point-of-sale system is also coming to fruition, and we plan to begin piloting it in fiscal 2016. Some benefits of the new system will include providing a more efficient customer checkout process by automating many manual processes as well as greatly enhancing our promotional capabilities such as opportunities for personalized coupon offers and potential loyalty programs. 
As importantly, the new point of sale system will provide the foundation for future enhancements and will allow for integration with the Beyond store as well as our web and mobile platforms. As shopping patterns continue to change, our physical channels will evolve, including the number of stores we have, their size and layout as well as their look and feel. These changes will reflect how customers utilize our stores, including for growing services such as reserve online, pick-up in store, returning items purchased online, scheduling appointments and interacting with our associates for registry and design services. 
Next, we have pricing. Where were we? We do not have a formal pricing team. Pricing decisions were made on a decentralized basis, and competitive prices were monitored manually through store visits and scanning retailer websites. Over the past several years, with the expansion of pricing transparency throughout retail, we put a pricing team and new systems in place to track competitive pricing to maintain our competitive position within the market. 
The team has already begun to affect change based on more timely and relevant competitor pricing information. Going forward, the team will further develop dynamic pricing capabilities to enable us to better manage and optimize market pricing decisions in real time. New systems will enhance our ability to set pricing, adjust pricing, react to competitor pricing and optimizing pricing for markdowns. We remain committed to offering our customers high-quality and differentiated products, services and solutions at the right value.
Let's turn to supply chain. Let's talk specifically about fulfillment to our customers. Since Bed Bath & Beyond essentially operated under a vendor direct-to-store model, we did not have any distribution facilities. So we really had no way to ship product to customers from a warehouse. 
Since then, we have opened or gained through acquisition 10 retail distribution facilities that also built out a store network to ship to customers, including about 175 stores operating as regional fulfillment locations. In addition, we have made significant investments in developing more flexible fulfillment options for customer delivery and expanding our distribution facility network to support anticipated growth across all our channels. 
Our enhanced capabilities, including being able to ship LTL and parcel direct from vendors or from some of our distribution facilities. Further, we have enhanced our current warehouse manager systems with new labor management modules to create efficiencies and reduce delivery times. 
Going forward, we will continue to assess our supply chain network to better optimize it so as to improve our delivery times and achieve important cost savings. In keeping with this, in the fall, we will be opening a new 800,000 square foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. This new facility will primarily fulfill online orders for all concepts and significantly improve our delivery capabilities. In addition, we are also working with various partners to pilot same-day delivery service in a limited number of markets.
Moving to real estate. Where were we? We've always conducted our real estate in-house and believe it to be another strong core competency. We have high standards for how we evaluate each real estate transaction and manage our portfolio in such a manner that the mid-store layouts, sizes, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability.
Many years ago, we recognized that the retail landscape was changing, and we raised the bar in how we evaluate real estate opportunities. As such, we began taking a much more conservative view of the store performance potential from a four-wall sales perspective, essentially assuming reductions in store traffic and additional migration to digital channels. 
Today, our stores remain very profitable. And as the physical and digital retail channels become more integrated, we believe that having a physical presence in the market is and will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. 
As many retailers have announced store closures, we have been asked why we are not being more aggressive in closing stores. Our answer is, we do close stores. However, in almost all cases, we have made the right judgment and done the right transactions in the first place so that our stores are profitable and provide enormous benefit to our customers and our company. 
Our stores still give us incredible opportunities to satisfy our customers and provide a noticeably better shopping experience. Our stores provide access to merchandise for immediate purchase or in-store pickup as well as access to knowledgeable store associates to answer product-specific questions, to provide product recommendations, to assist with a return or update a registry or to execute a Beyond store order. 
The success of our nationwide network of more than 1,500 stores benefits our digital channels as well since having a strong physical presence in local markets creates a broad level of consumer awareness of our brand. Our physical presence in local markets keeps us top of mind as customers decide when and where they want to shop online. 
Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio and both open and close stores when it makes sense. We are opening stores in new markets. We are testing smaller store formats, and we are making our stores more experiential to further leverage the differentiated products, services and solutions we provide. Our stores will evolve in such a way that reflects how our customers are utilizing their products, services and solutions. 
Before wrapping up, let me say a few words about our institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group. We acquired this nonretail business back in 2012 in order to better leverage our combined expertise, product knowledge, distribution synergies and relationships; to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers. Since then, we've been laying the groundwork for growth, including strengthening the leadership team and integrating systems. We are pleased with our progress to date and will continue to invest in order to prepare for future growth. 
As we begin a new fiscal year, we remain committed to and focused on positioning Bed Bath & Beyond for long-term success. The opportunities are abundant: to do more, for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the experts of the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; and to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants that they express their life interests and travel through their life stages, all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. 
As our business transforms, we will navigate the competitive landscape and adapt as customer preferences evolve. We will utilize internal and external resources to attract the right people and have the right technologies and products to advance our strategy, all the while remaining disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve long-term profitability. Our healthy cash flows and strong balance sheet enable us to fund these investments and build upon our operational achievements while also returning value to our shareholders.
In recognition of our strong cash flow generation and confidence in our business, as well as to provide a more balanced approach to returning value to shareholders, our Board of Directors has today authorized a dividend program and declared its first quarterly dividend of $0.125 to be paid on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. In addition to the dividend, we will continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchase. Sue will provide more details in a few minutes.
For those of you who have followed our company for some time, you know that we've managed our business for the long term. Our focus has never been about being the biggest but has always been about being the best. Our focus has never been about optimizing short-term profitability, but always about creating long-term prosperity. This has never been more true than it is today. We remain steadfast in making the correct investments for our long-term success. 
I will now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide some annual modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016 as well as some high-level comments regarding fiscal 2017. Sue?"
321778,321594898,957721,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7%",1445,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7% or 2.1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting an increase in the average transaction amount and a slight increase in the number of transactions. These results were at the upper end of the model range we provided back in January, which was between relatively flat and an increase of 2%. 
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 25% while comp sales from our stores were relatively flat. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 38.6%, down about 110 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin. Also contributing were increases in net direct-to-customer shipping expense and markdowns. For the year, the gross margin deleverage was less than it was in 2014, which is consistent with our model. 
SG&A for the fourth quarter was approximately 24% of net sales as compared to 23.8% last year. This increase as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, technology-related expenses including depreciation and advertising expense due in part to the growth in digital advertising, partially offset by a favorable net benefit of approximately 50 basis points from certain nonrecurring items, including a favorable state audit settlement.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $24.5 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36%, which was in line with our model assumptions back in January versus 37.4% last year. The tax rate decreased about 140 basis points as the current quarter includes about $7 million in discrete tax events versus $700,000 last year. 
As we had modeled, our unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact in the quarter was approximately $0.02 per diluted share. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 6.1% to $1.91 or $1.85 excluding the favorable net benefit from nonrecurring items of approximately $0.06.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $673 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.8 billion, up about 3.6%. This increase was due in part to an increase in inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, including the inventory associated with our recently opened Las Vegas distribution facility. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
CapEx for the year was approximately $328 million, relatively flat to last year and below our model of $350 million due to some of the anticipated spend for 2015 moving into 2016. A significant portion of the 2015 spend related to technology projects as well as new stores, existing store improvement, our new customer contact center in Utah and the new distribution facility in Las Vegas. 
We repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our stock during the fourth quarter. And as expected, we completed our $2 billion share repurchase program and began repurchasing shares under our new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization during the quarter. This new authorization was approved by the board in September 2015 and had a remaining balance of approximately $2.3 billion at the end of the year. Since 2004 through year-end 2015, the company has returned approximately $9.7 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases. So now let's turn to where we are going in 2016.
As we've indicated throughout this call, we are managing our business for the long term and making progress on our strategic initiatives. In keeping with this approach, I'd like to provide you with some full year modeling assumptions.
Comp sales increase of 1% to 2%, with total sales being about 90 basis points higher than the comp. Gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We do anticipate the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015. 
SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items. First, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility. Second, in response to wage increases impacting the retail sector, we are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates. Third, we are modeling store coverage to be consistent with the prior year to reflect the evolving nature of the services our stores provide. We are modeling the full year impact from these 3 payroll-related investments to be approximately $0.23 per diluted share. Fourth, we expect to make further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. We are modeling the full year impact of these tech investments to be approximately $0.17 per diluted share. 
Additional assumptions for fiscal 2016 include: depreciation expense estimate of $290 million, net interest expense estimate of $80 million; full year tax rate estimate in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Opening approximately 30 new stores across all concepts, most of which are planned to open in new markets for our various concepts. We also plan to close about 15 stores. CapEx estimate of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which are subject to the timing and composition of projects and includes some carryover of projects from 2015, as I mentioned earlier. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include the continued deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our digital, web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the ongoing development and deployment of our new POS system. 
In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores, as well as our program for renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
Also, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of this spending level. In addition to our newly authorized dividend program, we will continue to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. As a reminder, share repurchases may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As Steve said earlier, our earnings per diluted share has been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. And we believe we can again achieve earnings per diluted share at the high end of this range this year. And in the event our comp is higher than the 1% to 2% range we're modeling, exceed it. 
We believe our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share, excluding onetime items, will have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have in previous years with the exception that the percent for the first quarter is anticipated to be somewhat lighter and for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. 
Looking to 2017, a 53-week year, as I said, we plan CapEx to be less than our 2016 peak estimate range as the spend for a few of our larger capital projects such as most of the equipment required for our new POS system will have been completed while still allowing for appropriate investments in areas critical to our future. 
We also plan to open new stores mostly in new markets and close stores as market dynamics dictate. Regarding capital allocation, with today's announcement of the quarterly dividend program, we now anticipate the completion of a $2.5 billion share repurchase program will occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion date will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Before turning the call back over to Steve for some final remarks, please note that our next quarterly conference call will take place on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. At that time, we will review our first quarter results and provide an update on fiscal 2016 as well as answer some questions from the investment community.
I'll now turn this call back to Steve."

As Janet highlighted, we reported fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share of $5.10, including a $0.06 net benefit from certain nonrecurring items. Excluding this benefit, we were at $5.04, which marks the fourth year in a row that we've been in this $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago.

We have made tremendous progress in the transformation of our company to better serve our customers in an ever-evolving digital world. At the same time, our strategy remains rooted in our customer-centric culture and commitment to customer service; to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home, such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages, all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer.
Looking forward, we believe the dynamic and ever-changing retail environment presents a great opportunity for even greater success in the years ahead. The pace of change requires and rewards continuous innovation and the ability to adapt as technology advances and consumer preferences evolve. 
As a highly profitable market leader, we are committed to strengthening our business and making the strategic investments that will enable us to continue to do more for and with our customers. We are committed to becoming even more relevant to our existing customers and attracting new customers as they choose where, when and how to shop. 
With that in mind, I'd like to provide more details surrounding the technological developments impacting omnichannel retailing today and about the steps we've taken to transform our business, including a number of examples that demonstrate this in terms of where we've been, where we are and where we're going. 
I'll start with the evolution of our information technology group and our expanding capabilities. Where were we? Several years ago, our dedicated IT resources were much smaller and operated under a budget about 1/4 of the size it is now. Since then, these IT resources had increased by nearly 500 people, including addition of key members to our IT leadership team. Many of the additions have taken place within our digital technology group as we make further enhancements to and grow our digital footprint. 
Over the past several years, the IT group has upgraded or replaced the majority of our customer-facing and back-end systems and introduced new systems to enable us to utilize new technology while also enhancing the security and redundancy of our systems. Today, members of our IT group are immersed in all aspects of the business as technology has become the backbone so many of our initiatives can do more for and with our customers.
Going forward, we will focus on better integration of our systems in order to achieve a more comprehensive view of our customers as they interact with us across multiple channels and provide a more personalized customer experience. The IT group will continue to partner across the organization to deliver new technology and innovation to take advantage of the opportunity that our enhanced tools can provide. Over the course of this call, I will cover a number of these initiatives.
Next, our digital web and mobile capabilities. Where were we? The opportunities presented by new technologies surpassed our older systems' capabilities, making additional improvements to search, navigation and functionality more difficult. We also do not have mobile websites' applications for any of our concepts. 
For the past several years, we have relaunched our customer-facing websites for both Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and created a new selling website for Christmas Tree Shops andThat!. We now have mobile websites for all the concepts and have created apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY. 
We have continued to make improvements to the functionality, general search and navigation features across our customer-facing digital channels so that customers can find what they're looking for more quickly and efficiently. 
In addition, we've greatly expanded the functionality to allow us for the sale of personalized product, vendor direct-to-consumer items, which I'll refer to as VDC, and product that utilizes less-than-truckload shipping, which I'll refer to as LTL, such as furniture. 
We have also created new services and experiences for our customers such as online appointment scheduling for registry and a new virtual coupon wallet called My Offers, which organizes and stores print and digital coupons so customers can access and redeem them conveniently, online or in-store. 
Going forward in fiscal 2016, bringing multiple software releases to provide additional enhancements to all of our digital experiences. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized customer experience across all of our retail channels. 
In addition, we'll be launching a new series of curated and inspirational merchandise collections where customers will be able to conveniently shop the look. We also plan to add more places on the web for customers to upload their own personal content such as images of how they have used our products so that other customers may use them as inspiration. Also this year, we plan to relaunch our mobile apps for Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY and streamline our mobile websites to create a better user experience by making them faster and easier to use.
Now let's turn to analytics. Where were we? We do not have a centralized analytics group, and our data was to house in disparate systems across the company as well as the third-party providers. Since the data was disconnected, we were limited in our ability to tie various interactions together or comprehensively slice and dice information in order to efficiently reach the desired insights. 
Today, we have a structured analytics department with robust quantitative capabilities. We have made significant investments to hire talented people, re-engineer key business processes, build new systems and migrate, connect and consolidate all of our data into one central platform that we manage internally. 
We also augment our behavioral data with third-party demographic data to create an enhanced view of our customers. The analytics group is actively supporting many areas of our business, including merchandising, pricing, marketing, logistics, store operations and finance with meaningful advanced analytics, business intelligence and reporting to help drive enhanced performance and gain deep insights in how our customers interact with us across all our concepts, channels and countries in which we operate.
However, we're just scratching the surface in terms of how analytics can move our business forward. In the future, we will grow and extend the team's reach within the organization to provide valuable insights based on analysis and information from both external and internal systems. For example, further utilization of predictive modeling tools will enable us to achieve improved optimization to markdowns, pricing and direct mail campaigns. 
With our data initiatives, we will continue mapping customer interactions both in-store and through our various digital channels. This, in turn, allows us to get smarter about discerning and anticipating our customers' needs and providing inspiration and solutions and thus reinforcing that we know our customers and are the experts in the home. 
By leveraging our ever-expanding 360-degree view of the customer, we will further optimize targeting and tailoring techniques in marketing and enhance personalization both digitally and through traditional marketing media.
In merchandising, where were we? Well, as you know, our merchandising strategy was historically rooted in bed and bath. However, as we identified opportunities, we adopted our strategy and our name to meet the additional needs of our customers. In recognition of our expanding merchandise assortment within domestics and home furnishings, we added Beyond to our store name. 
Our acquisitions of Harmon, Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY in '02, '03 and '07 gave us an opportunity to further differentiate our merchandise assortment and our ability to do more for and with our customers. Over the past several years, in addition to all of this merchandise being available online and in stand-alone stores, we have also created specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, food and beverage within our stores to increasingly showcase this differentiated merchandise. We have continued to expand, differentiate and improve our merchandising-related services and solutions internally through our teams, including product development and externally via acquisition. 
The acquisition of Cost Plus World Market in 2012 gave us another avenue into the growing food, beverage and furniture categories. And the more recent Of a Kind acquisition in 2015 gives us an e-commerce platform geared towards millennials that offer specially commissioned, limited-edition items from up-and-coming artists and designers. 
Within Bed Bath & Beyond, we have exclusive or proprietary brands such as Wamsutta, Real Simple and Kenneth Cole Reaction Home, which enable us to provide differentiated merchandise across multiple product categories such as bedding, bath, storage, cleaning and dining. 
During fiscal 2015, we introduced additional proprietary brands within Bed Bath & Beyond, including SALT, .ORG and Studio 3B by Kyle Schuneman. More recently, we launched Artisanal Kitchen Supply, a collection of curated kitchen products. 
The increased functionality of our website has also produced and provided an opportunity for us to do more for and with our customers as we can now sell hundreds of thousands of items with the potential to sell millions of items that we did not sell previously and that we do not carry in our stores. With our capabilities to sell VDC and ship LTL, we have introduced new product categories such as mattresses, jewelry and furniture. Our assortment of outdoor and indoor furniture, which includes furniture for a baby's nursery, has increased significantly over the past year. We do see tremendous opportunity in the furniture and home decor categories and our plans to grow our assortment dramatically in the years to come. 
Consistent with this, we have also added resources, including associates and enhanced systems that will enable us to substantially increase the number of SKUs we can make available for sale in the categories where greater choice is valued by the customer. 
We have also been working to evolve the merchandise we carry and to improve the look and feel of our stores. An example is what we have done for our Christmas Tree Shops andThat! concept. We are excited to introduce our newest andThat! store to the Kennesaw, Atlanta market later this month. We have designed this store to have local appeal and to become the destination for customers to find an ever-changing mix of differentiated and closed-out merchandise, spanning categories such as home decor, seasonal, food, entertaining essentials and gifts, all at a great value.
Going forward, growing our product offerings, including in furniture and home decor categories and differentiated products, remains a focus for us. As our assortment grows, we will continue to review, refine and edit our offerings to present the right assortment in the right manner to our customers. 
Another area of focus is solutions-based product. An increasing number of innovative products have come to market that provide the connected home experience, which enable remote access to smart home devices such as thermostats, lighting and home security systems. Generally, we have introduced technology-related products within numerous departments, including bedding, kitchen, health and wellness and baby and kids.
We believe Bed Bath & Beyond is uniquely suited to benefit from the solutions-based and technology-driven product because we have extremely talented merchants who work daily with our vendors and product development teams in connection with developing new and differentiated merchandise. Our customers have come to expect new and innovative products from us. We provide good value at the right price, and we provide a high level of customer service. We are always looking to develop and present products that make the lives of our customers easier and more enjoyable.
Moving on to marketing. Where were we? Historically, our marketing program consisted primarily of postcards, newspaper inserts and circulars that often included coupon offers. Our strategy targeted customers based on proximity to one of our stores and past coupon usage, plus our ability to understand our customers' shopping preferences, lifestyles and life stages was limited because our customer data was fragmented, housed in different places and difficult to navigate. 
Several years ago, recognizing the growing influence of the web on consumer purchasing behavior and engagement with our brands, we expanded our in-house marketing team, including experts in digital marketing. Today, we use a full range of online and off-line vehicles in our marketing efforts, including e-mail, text, paid search, SEO, social media, display and affiliate programs as well as traditional print media such as postcards and circulars. 
Through our enhanced analytics capabilities, we are just beginning to utilize sophisticated, predictive modeling based on hundreds of data points, including both observed and inferred shopping behaviors to drive a more customer-centric marketing strategy. 
Recently, we have begun to implement a new marketing campaign management system to better target our customers and drive personalization. For example, in buybuy BABY, we've been evolving our direct mail and e-mail contact strategies to include a more personalized approach based on a customer's prenatal or postnatal life stage. 
While we have significantly increased our digital marketing efforts, we have also modified our print campaigns. Last year, we piloted our first-ever print catalog for Bed Bath & Beyond, introduced our online outdoor living collection. The book was distributed to a targeted group of customers that were identified using our predictive modeling tools as having a propensity to shop this product category. A digital version of the catalog was also available online. We were pleased with the results of this pilot and, as a result, plan to produce 3 category-specific catalogs in fiscal 2016. 
Going forward, our team will continue to leverage analytics in order to optimize our marketing strategies as we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us. This will enable us to tailor our marketing communications and provide our customers with more personalized, timely and relevant information, thereby furthering our efforts to establish our brand as the experts of the home and the destination for our customers' needs and wants. 
Next, store operations and customer service. Where were we? While both have always been strengths of our organization, it starts with our people and the culture they create. We are extremely proud of our associates who work hard to provide a noticeably better shopping experience for our customers. 
However, we have the opportunity to improve the tools and technologies available to service our customers and be more productive. For example, a proprietary internal web-based platform called The Beyond Store, while initially ahead of its time, proved to have limitations as technology evolved. 
Our labor scheduling system and point-of-sale systems are also in need of updating. Our technology investments over the past several years included the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. During 2014 and 2015, we rolled out our new workforce management system to Bed Bath & Beyond stores and going forward, plan to roll it out to all other concepts. 
In 2015, we significantly upgraded the Beyond Store platform and integrated it with our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY selling websites and mobile channels, which give our associates more functionality such as the ability to create LTL orders, compare products and read product reviews. This new platform has been fully rolled out to our stores in Canada and will be rolled out to the rest of the United States' Bed Bath & Beyond and BABY stores in 2016. 
During fiscal 2015, we also rolled out the new Beyond store platform through our customer contact teams and opened a new customer contact center in Layton, Utah, to supplement our East Coast operations and enhance our 24/7 customer support. Our customer contact centers are an essential component of the high-quality service and support we strive to provide to all of our customers, regardless of whether they are interacting with us in the store, on the phone, on e-mail or in a live chat. During fiscal 2016, we will be making further enhancements to the systems in our customer contact centers to enable a more personalized experience.
As other retailers closed stores and consolidate their customer contact centers, we are investing and strengthening our position as the leader in customer service. Our best-in-class registry services for wedding, baby, college and other life events also provide a unique opportunity to deepen our customer relationships by demonstrating a high level of customer service during important life stages. 
As consumer preference has continued to evolve, it is imperative that we further enhance our reputation for providing best-in-class customer service. Going forward, we have initiatives to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. 
For example, at our new Liberty View project in Brooklyn, which will house 4 of our concepts, we are creating a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment. And we are further integrating our omnichannel capabilities to provide a more experiential shopping environment. 
When the store opens towards the end of this summer, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes. In addition, customers will be able to use our Scan for More digital tool to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews. 
Our interactive catalogs will enable customers to view a curated assortment of products such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items. And our digital product advisory tool will help customers find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs. We believe that this venue, including the revised layout of our stores, along with enhanced services we offer, will become a shopping destination where our customers can have a fun and productive shopping experience.
Also going forward, our associate mobility initiative for our stores utilizes various technology-enabled tools, including mobile devices to enable our associates to provide greater floor coverage and a more personalized customer experience. With a mobile device, associates can gain instant access to product information and content as well as place in-store orders via the Beyond store. 
In addition, our multiyear investment in the new point-of-sale system is also coming to fruition, and we plan to begin piloting it in fiscal 2016. Some benefits of the new system will include providing a more efficient customer checkout process by automating many manual processes as well as greatly enhancing our promotional capabilities such as opportunities for personalized coupon offers and potential loyalty programs. 
As importantly, the new point of sale system will provide the foundation for future enhancements and will allow for integration with the Beyond store as well as our web and mobile platforms. As shopping patterns continue to change, our physical channels will evolve, including the number of stores we have, their size and layout as well as their look and feel. These changes will reflect how customers utilize our stores, including for growing services such as reserve online, pick-up in store, returning items purchased online, scheduling appointments and interacting with our associates for registry and design services. 
Next, we have pricing. Where were we? We do not have a formal pricing team. Pricing decisions were made on a decentralized basis, and competitive prices were monitored manually through store visits and scanning retailer websites. Over the past several years, with the expansion of pricing transparency throughout retail, we put a pricing team and new systems in place to track competitive pricing to maintain our competitive position within the market. 
The team has already begun to affect change based on more timely and relevant competitor pricing information. Going forward, the team will further develop dynamic pricing capabilities to enable us to better manage and optimize market pricing decisions in real time. New systems will enhance our ability to set pricing, adjust pricing, react to competitor pricing and optimizing pricing for markdowns. We remain committed to offering our customers high-quality and differentiated products, services and solutions at the right value.
Let's turn to supply chain. Let's talk specifically about fulfillment to our customers. Since Bed Bath & Beyond essentially operated under a vendor direct-to-store model, we did not have any distribution facilities. So we really had no way to ship product to customers from a warehouse. 
Since then, we have opened or gained through acquisition 10 retail distribution facilities that also built out a store network to ship to customers, including about 175 stores operating as regional fulfillment locations. In addition, we have made significant investments in developing more flexible fulfillment options for customer delivery and expanding our distribution facility network to support anticipated growth across all our channels. 
Our enhanced capabilities, including being able to ship LTL and parcel direct from vendors or from some of our distribution facilities. Further, we have enhanced our current warehouse manager systems with new labor management modules to create efficiencies and reduce delivery times. 
Going forward, we will continue to assess our supply chain network to better optimize it so as to improve our delivery times and achieve important cost savings. In keeping with this, in the fall, we will be opening a new 800,000 square foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. This new facility will primarily fulfill online orders for all concepts and significantly improve our delivery capabilities. In addition, we are also working with various partners to pilot same-day delivery service in a limited number of markets.
Moving to real estate. Where were we? We've always conducted our real estate in-house and believe it to be another strong core competency. We have high standards for how we evaluate each real estate transaction and manage our portfolio in such a manner that the mid-store layouts, sizes, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability.
Many years ago, we recognized that the retail landscape was changing, and we raised the bar in how we evaluate real estate opportunities. As such, we began taking a much more conservative view of the store performance potential from a four-wall sales perspective, essentially assuming reductions in store traffic and additional migration to digital channels. 
Today, our stores remain very profitable. And as the physical and digital retail channels become more integrated, we believe that having a physical presence in the market is and will continue to be a competitive advantage for us. 
As many retailers have announced store closures, we have been asked why we are not being more aggressive in closing stores. Our answer is, we do close stores. However, in almost all cases, we have made the right judgment and done the right transactions in the first place so that our stores are profitable and provide enormous benefit to our customers and our company. 
Our stores still give us incredible opportunities to satisfy our customers and provide a noticeably better shopping experience. Our stores provide access to merchandise for immediate purchase or in-store pickup as well as access to knowledgeable store associates to answer product-specific questions, to provide product recommendations, to assist with a return or update a registry or to execute a Beyond store order. 
The success of our nationwide network of more than 1,500 stores benefits our digital channels as well since having a strong physical presence in local markets creates a broad level of consumer awareness of our brand. Our physical presence in local markets keeps us top of mind as customers decide when and where they want to shop online. 
Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio and both open and close stores when it makes sense. We are opening stores in new markets. We are testing smaller store formats, and we are making our stores more experiential to further leverage the differentiated products, services and solutions we provide. Our stores will evolve in such a way that reflects how our customers are utilizing their products, services and solutions. 
Before wrapping up, let me say a few words about our institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group. We acquired this nonretail business back in 2012 in order to better leverage our combined expertise, product knowledge, distribution synergies and relationships; to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers. Since then, we've been laying the groundwork for growth, including strengthening the leadership team and integrating systems. We are pleased with our progress to date and will continue to invest in order to prepare for future growth. 
As we begin a new fiscal year, we remain committed to and focused on positioning Bed Bath & Beyond for long-term success. The opportunities are abundant: to do more, for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us; to provide our customers a seamless experience, whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and to be viewed as the experts of the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence; and to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants that they express their life interests and travel through their life stages, all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. 
As our business transforms, we will navigate the competitive landscape and adapt as customer preferences evolve. We will utilize internal and external resources to attract the right people and have the right technologies and products to advance our strategy, all the while remaining disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve long-term profitability. Our healthy cash flows and strong balance sheet enable us to fund these investments and build upon our operational achievements while also returning value to our shareholders.
In recognition of our strong cash flow generation and confidence in our business, as well as to provide a more balanced approach to returning value to shareholders, our Board of Directors has today authorized a dividend program and declared its first quarterly dividend of $0.125 to be paid on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. In addition to the dividend, we will continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchase. Sue will provide more details in a few minutes.
For those of you who have followed our company for some time, you know that we've managed our business for the long term. Our focus has never been about being the biggest but has always been about being the best. Our focus has never been about optimizing short-term profitability, but always about creating long-term prosperity. This has never been more true than it is today. We remain steadfast in making the correct investments for our long-term success. 
I will now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide some annual modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016 as well as some high-level comments regarding fiscal 2017. Sue?"
321778,321594898,957954,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7%",1445,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3.4 billion, up about 2.4% over last year or approximately 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7% or 2.1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting an increase in the average transaction amount and a slight increase in the number of transactions. These results were at the upper end of the model range we provided back in January, which was between relatively flat and an increase of 2%. 
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 25% while comp sales from our stores were relatively flat. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 38.6%, down about 110 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin. Also contributing were increases in net direct-to-customer shipping expense and markdowns. For the year, the gross margin deleverage was less than it was in 2014, which is consistent with our model. 
SG&A for the fourth quarter was approximately 24% of net sales as compared to 23.8% last year. This increase as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, technology-related expenses including depreciation and advertising expense due in part to the growth in digital advertising, partially offset by a favorable net benefit of approximately 50 basis points from certain nonrecurring items, including a favorable state audit settlement.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $24.5 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36%, which was in line with our model assumptions back in January versus 37.4% last year. The tax rate decreased about 140 basis points as the current quarter includes about $7 million in discrete tax events versus $700,000 last year. 
As we had modeled, our unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact in the quarter was approximately $0.02 per diluted share. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 6.1% to $1.91 or $1.85 excluding the favorable net benefit from nonrecurring items of approximately $0.06.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $673 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.8 billion, up about 3.6%. This increase was due in part to an increase in inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, including the inventory associated with our recently opened Las Vegas distribution facility. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
CapEx for the year was approximately $328 million, relatively flat to last year and below our model of $350 million due to some of the anticipated spend for 2015 moving into 2016. A significant portion of the 2015 spend related to technology projects as well as new stores, existing store improvement, our new customer contact center in Utah and the new distribution facility in Las Vegas. 
We repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our stock during the fourth quarter. And as expected, we completed our $2 billion share repurchase program and began repurchasing shares under our new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization during the quarter. This new authorization was approved by the board in September 2015 and had a remaining balance of approximately $2.3 billion at the end of the year. Since 2004 through year-end 2015, the company has returned approximately $9.7 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases. So now let's turn to where we are going in 2016.
As we've indicated throughout this call, we are managing our business for the long term and making progress on our strategic initiatives. In keeping with this approach, I'd like to provide you with some full year modeling assumptions.
Comp sales increase of 1% to 2%, with total sales being about 90 basis points higher than the comp. Gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We do anticipate the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015. 
SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items. First, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility. Second, in response to wage increases impacting the retail sector, we are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates. Third, we are modeling store coverage to be consistent with the prior year to reflect the evolving nature of the services our stores provide. We are modeling the full year impact from these 3 payroll-related investments to be approximately $0.23 per diluted share. Fourth, we expect to make further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. We are modeling the full year impact of these tech investments to be approximately $0.17 per diluted share. 
Additional assumptions for fiscal 2016 include: depreciation expense estimate of $290 million, net interest expense estimate of $80 million; full year tax rate estimate in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Opening approximately 30 new stores across all concepts, most of which are planned to open in new markets for our various concepts. We also plan to close about 15 stores. CapEx estimate of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which are subject to the timing and composition of projects and includes some carryover of projects from 2015, as I mentioned earlier. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include the continued deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our digital, web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the ongoing development and deployment of our new POS system. 
In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores as well as our program for renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
Also, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of this spending level. In addition to our newly authorized dividend program, we will continue to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. As a reminder, share repurchases may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As Steve said earlier, our earnings per diluted share has been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. And we believe we can again achieve earnings per diluted share at the high end of this range this year. And in the event our comp is higher than the 1% to 2% range we're modeling, exceed it. 
We believe our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share, excluding onetime items, will have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have in previous years with the exception that the percent for the first quarter is anticipated to be somewhat lighter and for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. 
Looking to 2017, a 53-week year, as I said, we plan CapEx to be less than our 2016 peak estimate range as the spend for a few of our larger capital projects such as most of the equipment required for our new POS system will have been completed while still allowing for appropriate investments in areas critical to our future. 
We also plan to open new stores mostly in new markets and close stores as market dynamics dictate. Regarding capital allocation, with today's announcement of the quarterly dividend program, we now anticipate the completion of a $2.5 billion share repurchase program will occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion date will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Before turning the call back over to Steve for some final remarks, please note that our next quarterly conference call will take place on Wednesday, June 22, 2016. At that time, we will review our first quarter results and provide an update on fiscal 2016 as well as answer some questions from the investment community.
I'll now turn this call back to Steve."

Our first quarter results were in line with the directional information we provided back in April on our year-end earnings call. During the first quarter, we made steady progress on our strategic initiatives",1608,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were in line with the directional information we provided back in April on our year-end earnings call. During the first quarter, we made steady progress on our strategic initiatives, which include significant investments in our business to further strengthen our foundation for future growth. 
At the same time, we remain vigilant in our mission to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us, to provide our customers a seamless experience whether they interact with us in a store through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence. 
So as to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. On our last call, I reviewed the transformation that has taken place in our company over the past several years. Today, I will provide a brief update on some of the notable developments since our call in April.
In our digital channels, the first of several upgrades planned for fiscal 2016 occurred early this month and included refinements to the user experience. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized omnichannel experience. We have made further improvements to both our online wedding and baby registry experiences to simplify the creation and management of these registries. 
Our mobile websites to these concepts have also been enhanced to improve usability, with refinements to the product list pages, product detail pages and checkouts. Earlier this month, we also relaunched our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY mobile apps with enhancements related to registry, navigation and product search.
From a merchandising perspective and in keeping with our objective to be viewed as the expert for the home, we debuted our new online series of curated and inspirational collections called Look Love on the Bed Bath & Beyond website during the first quarter. The initial collections include 5 different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections serve as lookbooks that engage and inspire customers through the lens of a specific lifestyle trend. We plan to continually refresh and launch new lookbooks in the future to help our customers find what they need for their home and to make it uniquely theirs. This merchandising initiative has been supported by targeted marketing communications to introduce and build awareness for these new collections.
With regard to marketing, we continue to leverage our ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customer, which enables us to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities, both digitally and through traditional marketing media. For example, as we further utilize our predictive modeling tools, we are able to achieve improved optimization of our direct mail and print campaigns, such as with our recent outdoor living catalog that was published during the first quarter and promoted directly to customers who were modeled to have a propensity to purchase outdoor furniture and accessories. 
The virtual version of this catalog is also available online. We applied the learnings from last year's catalog and developed an improved campaign that included a significantly larger distribution group. Early results of this campaign have been positive, and our analytical models improved with each iteration. As part of our continued investment in life stage marketing, later this month, we will be launching a targeted print campaign for our first student life college catalog. As we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us, we will be able to further optimize our marketing strategies and provide more personalized, timely and relevant information to them.
Another highlight of the first quarter was the exclusive launch of Ellen DeGeneres's new ED Ellen DeGeneres line of bedding in Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. This beautifully-designed high-quality bedding collection is reflective of Ellen's personal style and design aesthetic. We look forward to growing our partnership with Ellen as she looks to bring her vision for home and home-related merchandise to market. 
Another exciting introduction during the quarter was the grand opening of our newest store in Georgia. This store has a great look and feel. As I described in our last call, we designed this store to have local appeal with an ever-changing mix of differentiated merchandise and opportunistic purchases, spanning categories such as home decor, seasonal, food, wine and beer, entertaining essentials and guests, all at a great value. Early reviews have been outstanding. For those for whom it makes sense, we would love you to visit the store and give us your feedback. 
During the quarter, we opened 4 stores, including the Kennesaw and we closed 1. We also relocated several stores during the quarter, including our Bed Bath & Beyond store in Hyannis, Massachusetts that opened in its new location in March. As we evolve our stores, we look to integrate additional physical and digital capabilities to create a more experiential shopping environment and showcase the products, services and solutions we offer. 
In Hyannis, we have launched our Scan for More digital tool, which enables customers to see customer reviews on specific products as well as product images and pricing information, and our interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view a curated assortment of products in categories such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath. Later this month, we will be adding our digital product advisory tool to assist customers and find what they are looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs. If you ever get the chance, we'd also love for you to visit the store in Hyannis and give us your thoughts. 
Additionally, our development of a unique shopping venue in the Liberty View Industrial Park in Brooklyn continues, which will include 4 of our concepts. We currently project to open a preview early this fall. We remain excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with an even more experiential shopping environment through the integration of our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and our expanding and improving omnichannel capabilities. 
As we've described previously, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes as well as utilize our latest digital tools to assist them in finding the right merchandise for their home. 
To close out my quarterly update on our operations, I'd like to note that we remain on track to begin piloting our new point-of-sale system in our stores this year as well as to open a new 800,000-square-foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As a reminder, this new facility will allow for fulfilling online orders for all concepts and continue to improve our delivery capabilities.
As Janet mentioned, our purchase of One Kings Lane occurred last week after the close of our first quarter, and I'd like to give a warm welcome to our new associates. As an authority in home decor and design, One Kings Lane works directly with home furnishing brands, vintage dealers, designers and taste makers to offer curated merchandise assortment. 
Additionally, they deliver design inspiration and expert style advice. With studios in San Francisco and New York, they also provide complimentary interior design services. The One Kings Lane mission is to help make your home an expression of your personal style through access to a curated assortment, inspiration that fuels your passion and help putting it together. 
We have followed One Kings Lane and loved the site since its inception, and we are thrilled for the opportunity to provide the team with additional support and exposure to promote and grow the brand. At the same time, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. And together, we will be able to do even more for and with our collective customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us and to further our mission to be viewed as the expert for the home. 
Over time, we believe this relationship will provide us an opportunity to enhance our gift registry services as well as increase the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through their design services and studio locations. We're delighted to be able to partner with such a dedicated and talented group of people.
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, our strong operations allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as One Kings Lane as they may arise. 
As we've consistently said, we believe we are making the right investments to position our company for long-term success. Over the past several years, we have been transforming our company and have created an incredible foundation for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer. 
As always, I want to thank our dedicated associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. Sue?"
321778,330267047,1001791,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 22, 2016",2016-06-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat",1553,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat lighter than in previous years due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. Our actual first quarter results were in line with this directional information and included a marginal impact from the shift of Memorial Day from first quarter into second quarter this year. 
As you probably know, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings, so any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other quarters. Also as we said in last week's press release, the purchase of One Kings Lane had no effect on our first quarter results as the transaction occurred after the end of the first quarter.
Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat with the first quarter of last year due to an increase in net sales from new stores, offset by a decrease in comp sales. Comp sales for the quarter decreased by approximately 50 basis points, attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels continue to grow in excess of 20% while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the first quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the first quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of increases in both redemptions and average coupon amount. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in net direct to customer shipping expense.
SG&A for the first quarter was approximately 29.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. 
Net interest for the quarter was approximately $16.3 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.7% compared to approximately 37.5% in the prior year period. The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $500,000 this year and approximately $1.5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.80 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $645 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.3% compared to the end of the prior year period due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for direct to customer shipments. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $89 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital, web and mobile capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $178 million of our stock, representing about 3.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter.
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18 to shareholders of record as of September 16. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. 
Now I'd like to review our updated planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which include our actual first quarter results, recent trends in the business and our purchase of One Kings Lane, which we announced on June 14. 
We are modeling comp sales to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016, with net sales about 170 basis points higher than comp. Just as a reminder, One Kings Lane will be excluded from our comp sales calculations until after the anniversary of the purchase. 
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as we evaluate our free shipping threshold. We continue to expect that 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items: one, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility; two, an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates and response to wage increases impacting the broader workforce, including in the retail sector; three, store payroll hours comparable to the prior year to support servicing our customers in connection with omnichannel activities such as online appointment scheduling, the on-store orders, items reserved online and pick up in store, items returned to stores from online purchases and fulfillment from our stores; and four, further investments in technology and in our digital, web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. 
We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is estimated to be between $75 million and $80 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, a continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 are planned to be in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. 
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of the spending level. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system. 
In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I've just discussed, which reflect our first quarter results, current business trends and also include the slight dilution anticipated by our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, we believe our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share will still be comfortably within this range.
Also as I said earlier and as we planned -- explained on our last conference call, our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share were expected to have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have had in previous years, excluding onetime items, with the exception that we believe that the percent for the first quarter would be somewhat lighter and it was. And the fourth quarter contribution to full year earnings is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes.
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability.

When we looked at the site and we of the [indiscernible] we think that they communicate to the customer tremendously well. And again, when we talk about doing more with our customer and being viewed as the expert for the home, I mean, again in so many respects, they are there. They're customers whose passion is about the home really goes to that site and really looks at it on multiple times a day, the type of thing that you [indiscernible] on your lap with your iPad at the end of the night and before you go to sleep and you play with it. So they do a wonderful job. The plans are that one [ph] is basically we believe that there could be a very profitable models oats to provide those resources and support necessary to grow their business. Then as we said in the last call, we intend to really grow our furniture and home furnishings business, they and really have the ability to serve as a cornerstone for us doing that. They are give us really immediate credibility as we grow this business. So again, for them really, we want to give them the opportunity to even further define their point of view to really be able to create more differentiated merchandise, to really to strike with that customer and really will be sort of a shining star in all umbrella of brands, and that's how we view it. Then you look at other things that it could do for us, for example, we talked about being more experiential, and you look at the design services that they provide, the studio experience that they provide the customers in California, in San Fran and New York, those are the things we think would have legs also going forward and not even have application in our stores at some point. And then you take a look at the ability to register in certain respects either towards a large gift, offer a gift card, offer a specific furniture that could be available on a continuity basis and what it could mean for registry business. So these are all ways that we look at this business and really excites us."

So that's what remains to be determined as we have price transparency out there. And again, I think that we're starting to see some anniversary-ing of that price transparency that people everybody seems to be aware of the fact and more and more retail seem to be selling them at the same price. But again, really when it comes down to us [indiscernible] being at the right price and not being involved in a price war, and that means having differentiated products. So when we look at World Market and we look at what One Kings Lane can do in developing differentiated product, when we look at Christmas Tree and what they've done with differentiated product and our growing product development group at Bed Bath, being differentiated product is so important to us so that it doesn't become just about the price. But again, we can't be at a different price than other people are at. So we have to be at the right price. And when it comes to how do we price, it's an interesting question, it's a good question because we have a growing group in our analytics. We look at pricing. We surf the web or whatever you call everyday, multiple times a day or all throughout the day. And we -- our buyers and planners reporting each and every day, by item, by category, by vendor and prices are adjusted on a daily basis. But we are omnichannel. So our ability -- and we're doing dynamic pricing today. Again, for us, but we're doing it. But again, it's a little more difficult for us when it comes to items that you can find both online and in a store, because we don't have the capability or the desire really to change prices daily in our stores. So again, the product is direct from vendor or differentiated product is not a concern but we could be more aggressive. But for the product that you can find in-store and online to the extent that it's changed online and how to file listed in store, it's more difficult for us to do that. But again, being at the right price is essential to us."

And so again -- so I know it's difficult for people who are trying to write a model to say, ""Well, this turns around when?"" But what I would you like to say is being here every day and doing this now, entering my 25th year, we've never been stronger, never been a better company. I've never been more excited about it what we have. And again, we are going to be great and we're going to do very well.

Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. 
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated June 22, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some highlights from our financial results. First quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.80. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat to the prior year quarter. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 50 basis points. 
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18, 2016, to shareholders of record as of September 16, 2016. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17.
Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we previously described in our year-end press release and conference call. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve for his perspective on the first quarter and some operational highlights related to our strategic initiatives. In addition, he will share his thoughts regarding our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, an authority in home decor and design that offers a unique collection of select home goods, designer and vintage items. This transaction was announced on June 14. 
Later in the call, Sue will discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail and provide an update on our key modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will allow approximately 20 to 25 minutes for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Steve."
321778,330267047,1001821,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 22, 2016",2016-06-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were in line with the directional information we provided back in April on our year-end earnings call. During the first quarter, we made steady progress on our strategic initiatives",1610,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were in line with the directional information we provided back in April on our year-end earnings call. During the first quarter, we made steady progress on our strategic initiatives, which include significant investments in our business to further strengthen our foundation for future growth. 
At the same time, we remain vigilant in our mission to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us to provide our customers a seamless experience whether they interact with us in a store through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home, such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence so as to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. On our last call, I reviewed the transformation that has taken place in our company over the past several years. Today, I will provide a brief update on some of the notable developments since our call in April.
In our digital channels, the first of several upgrades planned for fiscal 2016 occurred early this month and included refinements to the user experience. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized omnichannel experience. We have made further improvements to both our online wedding and baby registry experiences to simplify the creation and management of these registries. Our mobile websites to these concepts have also been enhanced to improve usability, with refinements to the product list pages, product detail pages and checkouts. Earlier this month, we also relaunched our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY mobile apps with enhancements related to registry, navigation and product search.
From a merchandising perspective and in keeping with our objective to be viewed as the expert for the home, we debuted our new online series of curated and inspirational collections called LOOK LOVE on the Bed Bath & Beyond website during the first quarter. The initial collections include 5 different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections serve as lookbooks that engage and inspire customers through the lens of a specific lifestyle trend. We plan to continually refresh and launch new lookbooks in the future to help our customers find what they need for their home and to make it uniquely theirs. This merchandising initiative has been supported by targeted marketing communications to introduce and build awareness for these new collections.
With regard to marketing, we continue to leverage our ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customer, which enables us to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities, both digitally and through traditional marketing media. For example, as we further utilize our predictive modeling tools, we are able to achieve improved optimization of our direct mail and print campaigns, such as with our recent outdoor living catalog that was published during the first quarter and promoted directly to customers who were modeled to have a propensity to purchase outdoor furniture and accessories. The virtual version of this catalog is also available online. We applied the learnings from last year's catalog and developed an improved campaign that included a significantly larger distribution group. Early results of this campaign have been positive, and our analytical models improved with each iteration. 
As part of our continued investment in life stage marketing, later this month, we will be launching a targeted print campaign for our first student life college catalog. As we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us, we will be able to further optimize our marketing strategies and provide more personalized, timely and relevant information to them.
Another highlight of the first quarter was the exclusive launch of Ellen DeGeneres' new ED Ellen DeGeneres line of bedding in Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. This beautifully designed, high-quality bedding collection is reflective of Ellen's personal style and design aesthetic. We look forward to growing our partnership with Ellen as she looks to bring her vision for home and home-related merchandise to market. 
Another exciting introduction during the quarter was the grand opening of our newest andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia. This store has a great look and feel. As I described in our last call, we designed this store to have local appeal with an ever-changing mix of differentiated merchandise and opportunistic purchases, spanning categories such as home decor; seasonal food, wine and beer; entertaining essentials; and guests, all at a great value. Early reviews have been outstanding. For those for whom it makes sense, we would love you to visit the store and give us your feedback. 
During the quarter, we opened 4 stores, including the Kennesaw andThat! and we closed one. We also relocated several stores during the quarter, including our Bed Bath & Beyond store in Hyannis, Massachusetts that opened in its new location in March. As we evolve our stores, we look to integrate additional physical and digital capabilities to create a more experiential shopping environment and showcase the products, services and solutions we offer. 
In Hyannis, we have launched our scan-for-more digital tool, which enables customers to see customer reviews on specific products as well as product images and pricing information; and our interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view a curated assortment of products in categories such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath. Later this month, we will be adding our digital product advisory tool to assist customers and find what they are looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs. If you ever get the chance, we'd also love for you to visit the store in Hyannis and give us your thoughts. 
Additionally, our development of a unique shopping venue in the Liberty View Industrial Park in Brooklyn continues, which will include 4 of our concepts. We currently project to open Liberty View early this fall. We remain excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with an even more experiential shopping environment through the integration of our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and our expanding and improving omnichannel capabilities. 
As we've described previously, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes as well as utilize our latest digital tools to assist them in finding the right merchandise for their home. 
To close out my quarterly update on our operations, I'd like to note that we remain on track to begin piloting our new point-of-sale system in our stores this year as well as to open a new 800,000-square-foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As a reminder, this new facility will allow for fulfilling online orders for all concepts and continue to improve our delivery capabilities.
As Janet mentioned, our purchase of One Kings Lane occurred last week after the close of our first quarter, and I'd like to give a warm welcome to our new associates. As an authority in home decor and design, One Kings Lane works directly with home furnishing brands, vintage dealers, designers and taste makers to offer curated merchandise assortment. Additionally, they deliver design inspiration and expert style advice. With studios in San Francisco and New York, they also provide complementary interior design services. The One Kings Lane mission is to help make your home an expression of your personal style through access to a curated assortment, inspiration that fuels your passion and help putting it together. 
We have followed One Kings Lane and loved the site since its inception, and we are thrilled for the opportunity to provide the team with additional support and exposure to promote and grow the brand. At the same time, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. And together, we will be able to do even more for and with our collective customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us and to further our mission to be viewed as the expert for the home. 
Over time, we believe this relationship will provide us an opportunity to enhance our gift registry services as well as increase the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through their design services and studio locations. We're delighted to be able to partner with such a dedicated and talented group of people.
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, our strong operations allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, such as One Kings Lane, as they may arise. 
As we've consistently said, we believe we are making the right investments to position our company for long-term success. Over the past several years, we have been transforming our company and have created an incredible foundation for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer. 
As always, I want to thank our dedicated associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. Sue?"
321778,330267047,1001821,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 22, 2016",2016-06-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat",1549,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat lighter than in previous years due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. Our actual first quarter results were in line with this directional information and included a marginal impact from the shift of Memorial Day from first quarter into second quarter this year. 
As you probably know, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings, so any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other quarters. Also, as we said in last week's press release, the purchase of One Kings Lane had no effect on our first quarter results as the transaction occurred after the end of the first quarter.
Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat with the first quarter of last year due to an increase in net sales from new stores, offset by a decrease in comp sales. Comp sales for the quarter decreased by approximately 50 basis points, attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amounts. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels continued to grow in excess of 20%, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the first quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the first quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of increases in both redemptions and average coupon amount. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense.
SG&A for the first quarter was approximately 29.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. 
Net interest for the quarter was approximately $16.3 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.7% compared to approximately 37.5% in the prior year period. The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $500,000 this year and approximately $1.5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.80 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $645 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.3% compared to the end of the prior year period due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $89 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $178 million of our stock, representing about 3.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18 to shareholders of record as of September 16. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. 
Now I'd like to review our updated planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which include our actual first quarter results, recent trends in the business and our purchase of One Kings Lane, which we announced on June 14. 
We are modeling comp sales to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016, with net sales about 170 basis points higher than comp. Just as a reminder, One Kings Lane will be excluded from our comp sales calculations until after the anniversary of the purchase. 
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as we evaluate our free shipping threshold. We continue to expect the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items: one, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility; two, an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates and response to wage increases impacting the broader workforce, including in the retail sector; three, store payroll hours comparable to the prior year to support servicing our customers in connection with omnichannel activities, such as online appointment scheduling, the on-store orders, items reserved online and picked up in store, items returned to stores from online purchases and fulfillment from our stores; and four, further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. 
We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is estimated to be between $75 million and $80 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, a continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 are planned to be in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. 
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of the spending level. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system. In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I've just discussed, which reflect our first quarter results, current business trends and also include the slight dilution anticipated by our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, we believe our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share will still be comfortably within this range.
Also, as I said earlier and as we planned -- explained on our last conference call, our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share were expected to have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have had in previous years, excluding onetime items, with the exception that we believe that the percent for the first quarter would be somewhat lighter and it was. And the fourth quarter contribution to full year earnings is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes.
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability.

For example, we talked about being more experiential, and you look at the design services that they provide, the studio experience that they provide their customers in California, in San Fran and New York. Those are the things that, we think, could have legs also going forward and even -- might even have application in our stores at some point. And then you take a look at the ability to register in certain respects either towards a large gift, offer a gift card, offer a specific furniture that could be available on a continuity basis, so what it could mean for our registry business.

So that's interesting. But I guess, this time, we would talk about 25% and, I guess, we're somewhere along those lines. We get -- the language used is in excess of 20%. But again, the first quarter, they're relatively -- it's the smallest of all quarters for us. And again, the direction, nothing has changed. Our online digital business is growing extremely well. And at the same -- on the other end of the coin, we're seeing pressure placed upon the bricks and mortar aspect of our business by the lack of foot traffic that we would like to see or that I think that is being experienced across the board in bricks and mortar."

So that's what remains to be determined as we have price transparency out there. And again, I think that we're starting to see some anniversary-ing of that price transparency that people -- everybody seems to be aware of the fact and more and more retailers seem to be settling at the same price. But again, really what it comes down to, to a great extent, is being at the right price and not being involved in a price war, and that means having differentiated product. So when we look at World Market and we look at what One Kings Lane can do in developing differentiated product, when we look at Christmas Tree and what they've done with differentiated product and our growing product development group at Bed Bath, being about differentiated product is so important to us so that we -- so that it doesn't become just about the price. But again, we can't be at a different price than other people are at. So we have to be at the right price. And when it comes to how do we price, it's an interesting question. It's a good question because we have a growing group in our analytics. We look at pricing. We surf the web or whatever you call every day, multiple times a day or all throughout the day. And our buyers and planners, they're reporting each and every day by item, by categories, by vendor. And prices are adjusted on a daily basis, but we are omnichannel. So our ability -- and we're doing dynamic pricing today. Again, at its infancy for us, but we're doing it. But again, it's more difficult for us when it comes to items that you could find both online and in a store because we don't have the capability or the desire really to change prices daily in our stores. So again, so where the product is direct from vendor or a differentiated product is not a concern, but we could be more aggressive. But for the product that you can find in store and online, to the extent that it's changed online and we have to follow suit in store, it's more difficult for us to do that. But again, being at the right price is essential to us."

We do know that we do have a competitive set that people today to make decisions not based on short-term profitability, and they run their business as well and they good -- and they're servicing the customer well. So these are things that we have to respond to as well. So it's hard to -- and I know everybody wants to do a model and they want to say at what point in time will the margins turn around or what it's going to look like. But again, when you talk about how we're running the business, things we're investing in, is that -- you look at a number of years ago, and the people -- just a short time ago, when you had all the big boxes or when you had Borders books, you had Sports Authority, you had CircuitCity, you had all these industry leaders who are no longer around today because -- and you know that Toys “R” Us struggles. You go back and you say that what investments do you make and at what point in time and when do they pay you off, well, we just know in part that we'd be so much better off or we are so much better off with the investments we've made for where the company is today than if we didn't make these investments. So again, we could  chased short-term profitability or short-term comps by buying comps. There's a lot of things that we could be doing. But again, as we've always said and you know as well is that we're building this business from -- for the long term and that we think the foundation is very strong. And if you look around the company, if you walk the offices today, the analytics people, the people have all these Ph.D.s or master's degrees in statistics, the people that are doing product development for us, the people that are doing target marketing, when you look at the people that -- throughout the organization, you look at Of a Kind or you look at One Kings Lane, you look at the Clay [ph] that we have today, the company's never been stronger. And so again, is that -- so I know it's difficult for people who are trying to write a model to say, well, this turns around when. But all I could say is that being here every day and doing this now, entering my 25th year, we've never been stronger, never been a better company. I've never been more excited about what we have. And again, we're going to be great and we're going to do very well. And so when and where it comes out from a -- so turning a number around on the bottom line relative to where we are today, those are things that we wish we could tell you and we wish you could model it.

When you say is there -- I'm not sure if you asked if there's a goal or objective of where we want to be, but again, the customer will tell us because there's -- we don't pick a number or percentage of our assortment. We really look at it category by category what's the opportunity, what do we - what can we be bringing to market and making -- that makes us different, that has great value, that really adds something to the customers' choices out there, and then we look at other things, like, is it -- can you really make it? I mean, obviously things that would have plugged around mold, they're much more difficult to really work on differentiated product. But again, what's the markdown exposure? And so how much do you have to make? So all these things are taken into account. But the objective is really to be great merchants. And to be great merchants, we should be really a leader and bringing differentiated product to market.

In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18, 2016, to shareholders of record as of September 16, 2016. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17.
Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we previously described in our year-end press release and conference call. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve for his perspective on the first quarter and some operational highlights related to our strategic initiatives.

At the same time, we remain vigilant in our mission to do more, for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us to provide our customers a seamless experience whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home, such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence, so as to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. On our last call, I reviewed the transformation that has taken place in our company over the past several years. Today, I will provide a brief update on some of the notable developments since our call in April.
In our digital channels, the first of several upgrades planned for fiscal 2016 occurred early this month and included refinements to the user experience. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized omnichannel experience. We have made further improvements to both our online wedding and baby registry experiences to simplify the creation and management of these registries. Our mobile websites to these concepts have also been enhanced to improve usability, with refinements to the product list pages, product detail pages and checkouts. Earlier this month, we also relaunched our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY mobile apps with enhancements related to registry, navigation and product search.
From a merchandising perspective and in keeping with our objective to be viewed as the expert for the home, we debuted our new online series of curated and inspirational collections called LOOK LOVE on the Bed Bath & Beyond website during the first quarter. The initial collections include 5 different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections serve as Look books that engage and inspire customers through the lens of a specific lifestyle trend. We plan to continually refresh and launch new Look books in the future to help our customers find what they need for their home and to make it uniquely theirs. This merchandising initiative has been supported by targeted marketing communications to introduce and build awareness for these new collections.
With regard to marketing, we continue to leverage our ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customer, which enables us to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities, both digitally and through traditional marketing media. For example, as we further utilize our predictive modeling tools, we are able to achieve improved optimization of our direct mail and print campaigns, such as with our recent outdoor living catalog that was published during the first quarter and promoted directly to customers who were modeled to have a propensity to purchase outdoor furniture and accessories. The virtual version of this catalog is also available online. We applied the learnings from last year's catalog and developed an improved campaign that included a significantly larger distribution group. Early results of this campaign have been positive, and our analytical models improved with each iteration. 
As part of our continued investment in life stage marketing, later this month, we will be launching a targeted print campaign for our first student life college catalog. As we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us, we will be able to further optimize our marketing strategies and provide more personalized, timely and relevant information to them.
Another highlight of the first quarter was the exclusive launch of Ellen DeGeneres' new ED Ellen DeGeneres line of bedding in Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. This beautifully designed, high-quality bedding collection is reflective of Ellen's personal style and design aesthetic. We look forward to growing our partnership with Ellen as she looks to bring her vision for home and home-related merchandise to market. 
Another exciting introduction during the quarter was the grand opening of our newest andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia. This store has a great look and feel. As I described in our last call, we designed this store to have local appeal with an ever-changing mix of differentiated merchandise and opportunistic purchases, spanning categories such as home decor; seasonal food, wine and beer; entertaining essentials; and guests, all at a great value. Early reviews have been outstanding. For those for whom it makes sense, we would love you to visit the store and give us your feedback. 
During the quarter, we opened 4 stores, including the Kennesaw andThat! and we closed one. We also relocated several stores during the quarter, including our Bed Bath & Beyond store in Hyannis, Massachusetts that opened in its new location in March. As we evolve our stores, we look to integrate additional physical and digital capabilities to create a more experiential shopping environment and showcase the products, services and solutions we offer. 
In Hyannis, we have launched our scan-for-more digital tool, which enables customers to see customer reviews on specific products as well as product images and pricing information; and our interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view a curated assortment of products in categories such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath. Later this month, we will be adding our digital product advisor tool to assist customers in finding what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs. If you ever get the chance, we'd also love for you to visit the store in Hyannis and give us your thoughts. 
Additionally, our development of a unique shopping venue in the Liberty View Industrial Park in Brooklyn continues, which will include 4 of our concepts. We currently project to open Liberty View early this fall. We remain excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with an even more experiential shopping environment through the integration of our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and our expanding and improving omnichannel capabilities. 
As we've described previously, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes as well as utilize our latest digital tools to assist them in finding the right merchandise for their home. 
To close out my quarterly update on our operations, I'd like to note that we will remain on track to begin piloting our new point-of-sale system in our stores this year as well as to open a new 800,000-square-foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As a reminder, this new facility will allow for fulfilling online orders for all concepts and continue to improve our delivery capabilities.
As Janet mentioned, our purchase of One Kings Lane occurred last week after the close of our first quarter, and I'd like to give a warm welcome to our new associates. As an authority in home decor and design, One Kings Lane works directly with home furnishing brands, vintage dealers, designers and taste makers to offer curated merchandise assortment. Additionally, they deliver design inspiration and expert style advice. With studios in San Francisco and New York, they also provide complementary interior design services. The One Kings Lane mission is to help make your home an expression of your personal style through access to a curated assortment, inspiration that fuels your passion and help putting it together. 
We have followed One Kings Lane and loved the site since its inception, and we are thrilled for the opportunity to provide the team with additional support and exposure to promote and grow the brand. At the same time, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. And together, we will be able to do even more for and with our collective customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us and to further our mission to be viewed as the expert for the home. 
Over time, we believe this relationship will provide us an opportunity to enhance our gift registry services as well as increase the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through their design services and studio locations. We're delighted to be able to partner with such a dedicated and talented group of people.
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, our strong operations allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as One Kings Lane, as they may arise. 
As we've consistently said, we believe we are making the right investments to position our company for long-term success. Over the past several years, we have been transforming our company and have created an incredible foundation for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer. 
As always, I want to thank our dedicated associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. Sue?"
321778,330267047,1001830,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 22, 2016",2016-06-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat",1549,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat lighter than in previous years due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. Our actual first quarter results were in line with this directional information and included a marginal impact from the shift of Memorial Day from first quarter into second quarter this year. 
As you probably know, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings, so any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other quarters. Also, as we said in last week's press release, the purchase of One Kings Lane had no effect on our first quarter results as the transaction occurred after the end of the first quarter.
Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat with the first quarter of last year due to an increase in net sales from new stores, offset by a decrease in comp sales. Comp sales for the quarter decreased by approximately 50 basis points, attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amounts. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels continued to grow in excess of 20%, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the first quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the first quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of increases in both redemptions and average coupon amount. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense.
SG&A for the first quarter was approximately 29.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. 
Net interest for the quarter was approximately $16.3 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.7% compared to approximately 37.5% in the prior year period. The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $500,000 this year and approximately $1.5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.80 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $645 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.3% compared to the end of the prior year period due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $89 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $178 million of our stock, representing about 3.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18 to shareholders of record as of September 16. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. 
Now I'd like to review our updated planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which include our actual first quarter results, recent trends in the business and our purchase of One Kings Lane, which we announced on June 14. 
We are modeling comp sales to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016, with net sales about 170 basis points higher than comp. Just as a reminder, One Kings Lane will be excluded from our comp sales calculations until after the anniversary of the purchase. 
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as we evaluate our free shipping threshold. We continue to expect the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items: one, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility; two, an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates in response to wage increases impacting the broader workforce, including in the retail sector; three, store payroll hours comparable to the prior year to support servicing our customers in connection with omnichannel activities, such as online appointment scheduling, the on-store orders, items reserved online and picked up in store, items returned to stores from online purchases and fulfillment from our stores; and four, further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. 
We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is estimated to be between $75 million and $80 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, a continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 are planned to be in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. 
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of the spending level. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system. In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I've just discussed, which reflect our first quarter results, current business trends and also include the slight dilution anticipated by our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, we believe our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share will still be comfortably within this range.
Also, as I said earlier and as we planned -- explained on our last conference call, our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share were expected to have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have had in previous years, excluding onetime items, with the exception that we believe that the percent for the first quarter would be somewhat lighter and it was. And the fourth quarter contribution to full year earnings is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes.
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability.
Before opening the call to Q&A, we plan to report our 2016 fiscal second quarter results on Wednesday, September 21. Janet?"

Those are the things that we think could have legs also going forward and even -- might even have application in our stores at some point. And then you take a look at the ability to register in certain respects either towards a large gift, offer a gift card, offer specific furniture that could be available on a continuity basis, so what it could mean for our registry business.

So that's what remains to be determined as we have price transparency out there. And again, I think that we're starting to see some anniversary-ing of that price transparency that people -- everybody seems to be aware of the fact and more and more retailers seem to be settling at the same price. But again, really what it comes down to, to a great extent, is being at the right price and not being involved in a price war, and that means having differentiated product. So when we look at World Market and we look at what One Kings Lane can do in developing differentiated product, when we look at Christmas Tree and what they've done with differentiated product and our growing product development group at Bed Bath, being about differentiated product is so important to us so that we -- so that it doesn't become just about the price. But again, we can't be at a different price than other people are at. So we have to be at the right price. And when it comes to how do we price, it's an interesting question. It's a good question because we have a growing group in our analytics. We look at pricing. We surf the web or whatever you call it, every day, multiple times a day or all throughout the day. And our buyers and planners, they're reporting each and every day by item, by categories, by vendor. And prices are adjusted on a daily basis, but we are omnichannel. So our ability -- and we're doing dynamic pricing today. Again, at its infancy for us, but we're doing it. But again, it's more difficult for us when it comes to items that you could find both online and in a store because we don't have the capability or the desire really to change prices daily in our stores. So again, so where the product is direct from vendor or is a differentiated product, it's not a concern, but we could be more aggressive. But for the product that you can find in store and online, to the extent that it's changed online and we have to follow suit in store, it's more difficult for us to do that. But again, being at the right price is essential to us."

We do know that we do have a competitive set that people today to make decisions not based on short-term profitability, and they run their business as well and they good -- and they're servicing the customer well. So these are things that we have to respond to as well. So it's hard to -- and I know everybody wants to do a model and they want to say at what point in time will the margins turn around or what it's going to look like. But again, when you talk about how we're running the business, things we're investing in, is that -- you look at a number of years ago, and the people -- just a short time ago, when you had all the big boxes, so when you had Borders books, you had Sports Authority, you had CircuitCity, you had all these industry leaders who are no longer around today because -- you know that Toys “R” Us struggles. You go back and you say that what investments do you make and at what point in time and when do they pay you off. Well, we just know in part that we'd be so much better off or we are so much better off with the investments we've made for where the company is today than if we didn't make these investments. So again, we could have chased short-term profitability or short-term comps by buying comps. There's a lot of things that we could be doing. But again, as we've always said and you know as well is that we're building this business from -- for the long term and that we think the foundation is very strong. And if you look around the company, if you walk the offices today, the analytics people, the people have all these Ph.D.s or master's degrees in statistics, the people that are doing product development for us, the people that are doing target marketing, when you look at the people that -- throughout the organization, you look at Of a Kind or you look at One Kings Lane, you look at the Clay [ph] that we have today, the company's never been stronger. And so again, is that -- so I know it's difficult for people who are trying to write a model to say, well, this turns around when. But all I could say is that being here every day and doing this now, entering my 25th year, we've never been stronger, never been a better company. I've never been more excited about what we have. And again, we're going to be great and we're going to do very well. And so -- but when and where it comes out from turning a number around on the bottom line relative to where we are today, those are things that we wish we could tell you and we wish you could model it. But the investments we're making, we're very, very confident and confident in the direction of the company and very confident in our people."

When you say is there -- I'm not sure if you asked if there's a goal or objective of where we want to be, but again, the customer will tell us because there's -- we don't pick a number or a percentage of our assortment.

I mean, obviously things with a plug or a mold, they're much more difficult to really work on differentiated product. But again, what's the markdown exposure? And so how much do you have to make? So all these things are taken into account. But the objective is really to be great merchants. And to be great merchants, we should be really a leader and bringing differentiated product to market. So it is the objective and objective of every part of the organization, and it's been growing in every part of the organization even if you look at Harmon Face Values, for example, when you look at all the private-label product that we're bringing to market, so again, very, very, very critical for us."

So again, we do believe we have to move down the continuum in that way. But at the same time, when we add more product today because of analytics and target marketing and the ability to serve up to a customer something, know where the customer came from online, where they are going to, what their interests are, what they purchase from us, to give them a view that really speaks to that customer so they don't have to be bothered with. If they love to bake, that's what they see our site for and they -- that's what they see our assortment. So we don't have to show them a chicken coop or a snowblower.

All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today. Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. 
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated June 22, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some highlights from our financial results. First quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.80. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat to the prior year quarter. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 50 basis points. 
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18, 2016, to shareholders of record as of September 16, 2016. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17.
Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we previously described in our year-end press release and conference call. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve for his perspective on the first quarter and some operational highlights related to our strategic initiatives. In addition, he will share his thoughts regarding our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, an authority in home decor and design that offers a unique collection of select home goods, designer and vintage items. This transaction was announced on June 14. 
Later in the call, Sue will discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail and provide an update on our key modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will allow approximately 20 to 25 minutes for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Steve."

On our last call, I reviewed the transformation that has taken place in our company over the past several years. Today, I will provide a brief update on some of the notable developments since our call in April.
In our digital channels, the first of several upgrades planned for fiscal 2016 occurred early this month and included refinements to the user experience. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized omnichannel experience. We have made further improvements to both our online wedding and baby registry experiences to simplify the creation and management of these registries. Our mobile websites to these concepts have also been enhanced to improve usability, with refinements to the product list pages, product detail pages and checkouts. Earlier this month, we also relaunched our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY mobile apps with enhancements related to registry, navigation and product search.
From a merchandising perspective and in keeping with our objective to be viewed as the expert for the home, we debuted our new online series of curated and inspirational collections called LOOK LOVE on the Bed Bath & Beyond website during the first quarter. The initial collections include 5 different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections serve as Look books that engage and inspire customers through the lens of a specific lifestyle trend. We plan to continually refresh and launch new Look books in the future to help our customers find what they need for their home and to make it uniquely theirs. This merchandising initiative has been supported by targeted marketing communications to introduce and build awareness for these new collections.
With regard to marketing, we continue to leverage our ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customer, which enables us to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities, both digitally and through traditional marketing media. For example, as we further utilize our predictive modeling tools, we are able to achieve improved optimization of our direct mail and print campaigns, such as with our recent outdoor living catalog that was published during the first quarter and promoted directly to customers who were modeled to have a propensity to purchase outdoor furniture and accessories. The virtual version of this catalog is also available online. We applied the learnings from last year's catalog and developed an improved campaign that included a significantly larger distribution group. Early results of this campaign have been positive, and our analytical models improved with each iteration. 
As part of our continued investment in life stage marketing, later this month, we will be launching a targeted print campaign for our first student life college catalog. As we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us, we will be able to further optimize our marketing strategies and provide more personalized, timely and relevant information to them.
Another highlight of the first quarter was the exclusive launch of Ellen DeGeneres' new ED Ellen DeGeneres line of bedding in Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. This beautifully designed, high-quality bedding collection is reflective of Ellen's personal style and design aesthetic. We look forward to growing our partnership with Ellen as she looks to bring her vision for home and home-related merchandise to market. 
Another exciting introduction during the quarter was the grand opening of our newest andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia. This store has a great look and feel. As I described in our last call, we designed this store to have local appeal with an ever-changing mix of differentiated merchandise and opportunistic purchases, spanning categories such as home decor; seasonal food, wine and beer; entertaining essentials; and guests, all at a great value. Early reviews have been outstanding. For those for whom it makes sense, we would love you to visit the store and give us your feedback. 
During the quarter, we opened 4 stores, including the Kennesaw andThat! and we closed one. We also relocated several stores during the quarter, including our Bed Bath & Beyond store in Hyannis, Massachusetts that opened in its new location in March. As we evolve our stores, we look to integrate additional physical and digital capabilities to create a more experiential shopping environment and showcase the products, services and solutions we offer. 
In Hyannis, we have launched our scan-for-more digital tool, which enables customers to see customer reviews on specific products as well as product images and pricing information; and our interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view a curated assortment of products in categories such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath. Later this month, we will be adding our digital product advisor tool to assist customers in finding what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs. If you ever get the chance, we'd also love for you to visit the store in Hyannis and give us your thoughts. 
Additionally, our development of a unique shopping venue in the Liberty View Industrial Park in Brooklyn continues, which will include 4 of our concepts. We currently project to open Liberty View early this fall. We remain excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with an even more experiential shopping environment through the integration of our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and our expanding and improving omnichannel capabilities. 
As we've described previously, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes as well as utilize our latest digital tools to assist them in finding the right merchandise for their home. 
To close out my quarterly update on our operations, I'd like to note that we will remain on track to begin piloting our new point-of-sale system in our stores this year as well as to open a new 800,000-square-foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As a reminder, this new facility will allow for fulfilling online orders for all concepts and continue to improve our delivery capabilities.
As Janet mentioned, our purchase of One Kings Lane occurred last week after the close of our first quarter, and I'd like to give a warm welcome to our new associates. As an authority in home decor and design, One Kings Lane works directly with home furnishing brands, vintage dealers, designers and taste makers to offer curated merchandise assortment. Additionally, they deliver design inspiration and expert style advice. With studios in San Francisco and New York, they also provide complementary interior design services. The One Kings Lane mission is to help make your home an expression of your personal style through access to a curated assortment, inspiration that fuels your passion and help putting it together. 
We have followed One Kings Lane and loved the site since its inception, and we are thrilled for the opportunity to provide the team with additional support and exposure to promote and grow the brand. At the same time, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. And together, we will be able to do even more for and with our collective customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us and to further our mission to be viewed as the expert for the home. 
Over time, we believe this relationship will provide us an opportunity to enhance our gift registry services as well as increase the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through their design services and studio locations. We're delighted to be able to partner with such a dedicated and talented group of people.
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, our strong operations allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as One Kings Lane, as they may arise. 
As we've consistently said, we believe we are making the right investments to position our company for long-term success. Over the past several years, we have been transforming our company and have created an incredible foundation for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer. 
As always, I want to thank our dedicated associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. Sue?"
321778,330267047,1001873,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 22, 2016",2016-06-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat",1549,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat lighter than in previous years due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. Our actual first quarter results were in line with this directional information and included a marginal impact from the shift of Memorial Day from first quarter into second quarter this year. 
As you probably know, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings, so any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other quarters. Also, as we said in last week's press release, the purchase of One Kings Lane had no effect on our first quarter results as the transaction occurred after the end of the first quarter.
Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat with the first quarter of last year due to an increase in net sales from new stores, offset by a decrease in comp sales. Comp sales for the quarter decreased by approximately 50 basis points, attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amounts. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels continued to grow in excess of 20%, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the first quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the first quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of increases in both redemptions and average coupon amount. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense.
SG&A for the first quarter was approximately 29.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. 
Net interest for the quarter was approximately $16.3 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.7% compared to approximately 37.5% in the prior year period. The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $500,000 this year and approximately $1.5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.80 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $645 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.3% compared to the end of the prior year period due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $89 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $178 million of our stock, representing about 3.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18 to shareholders of record as of September 16. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. 
Now I'd like to review our updated planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which include our actual first quarter results, recent trends in the business and our purchase of One Kings Lane, which we announced on June 14. 
We are modeling comp sales to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016, with net sales about 170 basis points higher than comp. Just as a reminder, One Kings Lane will be excluded from our comp sales calculations until after the anniversary of the purchase. 
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as we evaluate our free shipping threshold. We continue to expect the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items: one, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility; two, an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates in response to wage increases impacting the broader workforce, including in the retail sector; three, store payroll hours comparable to the prior year to support servicing our customers in connection with omnichannel activities, such as online appointment scheduling, the on-store orders, items reserved online and picked up in store, items returned to stores from online purchases and fulfillment from our stores; and four, further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. 
We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is estimated to be between $75 million and $80 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, a continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 are planned to be in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. 
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of the spending level. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system. In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I've just discussed, which reflect our first quarter results, current business trends and also include the slight dilution anticipated by our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, we believe our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share will still be comfortably within this range.
Also, as I said earlier and as we planned -- explained on our last conference call, our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share were expected to have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have had in previous years, excluding onetime items, with the exception that we believe that the percent for the first quarter would be somewhat lighter and it was. And the fourth quarter contribution to full year earnings is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes.
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability.
Before opening the call to Q&A, we plan to report our 2016 fiscal second quarter results on Wednesday, September 21. Janet?"

Those are the things that we think could have legs also going forward and even -- might even have application in our stores at some point. And then you take a look at the ability to register in certain respects either towards a large gift, offer a gift card, offer specific furniture that could be available on a continuity basis, so what it could mean for our registry business.

So that's what remains to be determined as we have price transparency out there. And again, I think that we're starting to see some anniversary-ing of that price transparency that people -- everybody seems to be aware of the fact and more and more retailers seem to be settling at the same price. But again, really what it comes down to, to a great extent, is being at the right price and not being involved in a price war, and that means having differentiated product. So when we look at World Market and we look at what One Kings Lane can do in developing differentiated product, when we look at Christmas Tree and what they've done with differentiated product and our growing product development group at Bed Bath, being about differentiated product is so important to us so that we -- so that it doesn't become just about the price. But again, we can't be at a different price than other people are at. So we have to be at the right price. And when it comes to how do we price, it's an interesting question. It's a good question because we have a growing group in our analytics. We look at pricing. We surf the web or whatever you call it, every day, multiple times a day or all throughout the day. And our buyers and planners, they're reporting each and every day by item, by categories, by vendor. And prices are adjusted on a daily basis, but we are omnichannel. So our ability -- and we're doing dynamic pricing today. Again, at its infancy for us, but we're doing it. But again, it's more difficult for us when it comes to items that you could find both online and in a store because we don't have the capability or the desire really to change prices daily in our stores. So again, so where the product is direct from vendor or is a differentiated product, it's not a concern, but we could be more aggressive. But for the product that you can find in store and online, to the extent that it's changed online and we have to follow suit in store, it's more difficult for us to do that. But again, being at the right price is essential to us."

We know that our gross margin still remains some of the strongest in retail despite the declines. We do know that we do have a competitive set that people today to make decisions not based on short-term profitability, and they run their business as well and they good -- and they're servicing the customer well. So these are things that we have to respond to as well. So it's hard to -- and I know everybody wants to do a model and they want to say at what point in time will the margins turn around or what it's going to look like. But again, when you talk about how we're running the business, things we're investing in, is that -- you look at a number of years ago, and the people -- just a short time ago, when you had all the big boxes, so when you had Borders books, you had Sports Authority, you had CircuitCity, you had all these industry leaders who are no longer around today because -- you know that Toys “R” Us struggles. You go back and you say that what investments do you make and at what point in time and when do they pay you off. Well, we just know in part that we'd be so much better off or we are so much better off with the investments we've made for where the company is today than if we didn't make these investments. So again, we could have chased short-term profitability or short-term comps by buying comps. There's a lot of things that we could be doing. But again, as we've always said and you know as well is that we're building this business from -- for the long term and that we think the foundation is very strong. And if you look around the company, if you walk the offices today, the analytics people, the people have all these Ph.D.s or master's degrees in statistics, the people that are doing product development for us, the people that are doing target marketing, when you look at the people that -- throughout the organization, you look at Of a Kind or you look at One Kings Lane, you look at the Clay [ph] that we have today, the company's never been stronger. And so again, is that -- so I know it's difficult for people who are trying to write a model to say, well, this turns around when. But all I could say is that being here every day and doing this now, entering my 25th year, we've never been stronger, never been a better company. I've never been more excited about what we have. And again, we're going to be great and we're going to do very well. And so -- but when and where it comes out from turning a number around on the bottom line relative to where we are today, those are things that we wish we could tell you and we wish you could model it. But the investments we're making, we're very, very confident and confident in the direction of the company and very confident in our people."

I mean, obviously things with a plug or a mold, they're much more difficult to really work on differentiated product. But again, what's the markdown exposure? And so how much do you have to make?

So again, we do believe we have to move down the continuum in that way. But at the same time, when we add more product today because of analytics and target marketing and the ability to serve up to a customer something, know where the customer came from online, where they are going to, what their interests are, what they purchase from us, to give them a view that really speaks to that customer so they don't have to be bothered with. If they love to bake, that's what they see our site for and they -- that's what they see our assortment. So we don't have to show them a chicken coop or a snowblower.

All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today. Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. 
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated June 22, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some highlights from our financial results. First quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.80. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat to the prior year quarter. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 50 basis points. 
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18, 2016, to shareholders of record as of September 16, 2016. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17.
Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we previously described in our year-end press release and conference call. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve for his perspective on the first quarter and some operational highlights related to our strategic initiatives. In addition, he will share his thoughts regarding our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, an authority in home decor and design that offers a unique collection of select home goods, designer and vintage items. This transaction was announced on June 14. 
Later in the call, Sue will discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail and provide an update on our key modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will allow approximately 20 to 25 minutes for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Steve."

Our first quarter results were in line with the directional information we provided back in April on our year-end earnings call. During the first quarter, we made steady progress on our strategic initiatives, which include significant investments in our business to further strengthen our foundation for future growth. 
At the same time, we remain vigilant in our mission to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us to provide our customers a seamless experience whether they interact with us in a store through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media and to be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home, such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college and moving to a new residence so as to become the destination for our customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. On our last call, I reviewed the transformation that has taken place in our company over the past several years. Today, I will provide a brief update on some of the notable developments since our call in April.
In our digital channels, the first of several upgrades planned for fiscal 2016 occurred early this month and included refinements to the user experience. As consumer shopping preferences evolve, we remain focused on providing a consistently better and more personalized omnichannel experience. We have made further improvements to both our online wedding and baby registry experiences to simplify the creation and management of these registries. Our mobile websites to these concepts have also been enhanced to improve usability, with refinements to the product list pages, product detail pages and checkouts. Earlier this month, we also relaunched our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY mobile apps with enhancements related to registry, navigation and product search.
From a merchandising perspective and in keeping with our objective to be viewed as the expert for the home, we debuted our new online series of curated and inspirational collections called LOOK LOVE on the Bed Bath & Beyond website during the first quarter. The initial collections include 5 different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections serve as lookbooks that engage and inspire customers through the lens of a specific lifestyle trend. We plan to continually refresh and launch new lookbooks in the future to help our customers find what they need for their home and to make it uniquely theirs. This merchandising initiative has been supported by targeted marketing communications to introduce and build awareness for these new collections.
With regard to marketing, we continue to leverage our ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customer, which enables us to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities, both digitally and through traditional marketing media. For example, as we further utilize our predictive modeling tools, we are able to achieve improved optimization of our direct mail and print campaigns, such as with our recent outdoor living catalog that was published during the first quarter and promoted directly to customers who were modeled to have a propensity to purchase outdoor furniture and accessories. The virtual version of this catalog is also available online. We applied the learnings from last year's catalog and developed an improved campaign that included a significantly larger distribution group. Early results of this campaign have been positive, and our analytical models improved with each iteration. 
As part of our continued investment in life stage marketing, later this month, we will be launching a targeted print campaign for our first student life college catalog. As we learn more about our customers and how they prefer to interact with us, we will be able to further optimize our marketing strategies and provide more personalized, timely and relevant information to them.
Another highlight of the first quarter was the exclusive launch of Ellen DeGeneres' new ED Ellen DeGeneres line of bedding in Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. This beautifully designed, high-quality bedding collection is reflective of Ellen's personal style and design aesthetic. We look forward to growing our partnership with Ellen as she looks to bring her vision for home and home-related merchandise to market. 
Another exciting introduction during the quarter was the grand opening of our newest andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia. This store has a great look and feel. As I described in our last call, we designed this store to have local appeal with an ever-changing mix of differentiated merchandise and opportunistic purchases, spanning categories such as home decor; seasonal food, wine and beer; entertaining essentials; and guests, all at a great value. Early reviews have been outstanding. For those for whom it makes sense, we would love you to visit the store and give us your feedback. 
During the quarter, we opened 4 stores, including the Kennesaw andThat! and we closed one. We also relocated several stores during the quarter, including our Bed Bath & Beyond store in Hyannis, Massachusetts that opened in its new location in March. As we evolve our stores, we look to integrate additional physical and digital capabilities to create a more experiential shopping environment and showcase the products, services and solutions we offer. 
In Hyannis, we have launched our scan-for-more digital tool, which enables customers to see customer reviews on specific products as well as product images and pricing information; and our interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view a curated assortment of products in categories such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath. Later this month, we will be adding our digital product advisor tool to assist customers in finding what they are looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs. If you ever get the chance, we'd also love for you to visit the store in Hyannis and give us your thoughts. 
Additionally, our development of a unique shopping venue in the Liberty View Industrial Park in Brooklyn continues, which will include 4 of our concepts. We currently project to open Liberty View early this fall. We remain excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with an even more experiential shopping environment through the integration of our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and our expanding and improving omnichannel capabilities. 
As we've described previously, customers will be able to experience product demonstrations and how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes as well as utilize our latest digital tools to assist them in finding the right merchandise for their home. 
To close out my quarterly update on our operations, I'd like to note that we will remain on track to begin piloting our new point-of-sale system in our stores this year as well as to open a new 800,000-square-foot distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As a reminder, this new facility will allow for fulfilling online orders for all concepts and continue to improve our delivery capabilities.
As Janet mentioned, our purchase of One Kings Lane occurred last week after the close of our first quarter, and I'd like to give a warm welcome to our new associates. As an authority in home decor and design, One Kings Lane works directly with home furnishing brands, vintage dealers, designers and taste makers to offer curated merchandise assortment. Additionally, they deliver design inspiration and expert style advice. With studios in San Francisco and New York, they also provide complementary interior design services. The One Kings Lane mission is to help make your home an expression of your personal style through access to a curated assortment, inspiration that fuels your passion and help putting it together. 
We have followed One Kings Lane and loved the site since its inception, and we are thrilled for the opportunity to provide the team with additional support and exposure to promote and grow the brand. At the same time, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. And together, we will be able to do even more for and with our collective customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us and to further our mission to be viewed as the expert for the home. 
Over time, we believe this relationship will provide us an opportunity to enhance our gift registry services as well as increase the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through their design services and studio locations. We're delighted to be able to partner with such a dedicated and talented group of people.
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, our strong operations allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, such as One Kings Lane, as they may arise. 
As we've consistently said, we believe we are making the right investments to position our company for long-term success. Over the past several years, we have been transforming our company and have created an incredible foundation for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer. 
As always, I want to thank our dedicated associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2016. Sue?"
321778,330267047,1002174,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 22, 2016",2016-06-22,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat",1549,"Thanks, Steve. I'll start with a review of our first quarter results. As we stated during our last earnings call in April, we anticipated that the contribution of this year's first quarter net earnings per diluted share to the full year would be somewhat lighter than in previous years due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes. Our actual first quarter results were in line with this directional information and included a marginal impact from the shift of Memorial Day from first quarter into second quarter this year. 
As you probably know, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings, so any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other quarters. Also, as we said in last week's press release, the purchase of One Kings Lane had no effect on our first quarter results as the transaction occurred after the end of the first quarter.
Net sales for the quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, flat with the first quarter of last year due to an increase in net sales from new stores, offset by a decrease in comp sales. Comp sales for the quarter decreased by approximately 50 basis points, attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amounts. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels continued to grow in excess of 20%, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the first quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the first quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of increases in both redemptions and average coupon amount. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense.
SG&A for the first quarter was approximately 29.6% of net sales as compared to approximately 28.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. Also contributing, to a lesser extent, was an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. 
Net interest for the quarter was approximately $16.3 million and related primarily to interest from our debt. Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.7% compared to approximately 37.5% in the prior year period. The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $500,000 this year and approximately $1.5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.80 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $645 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.3% compared to the end of the prior year period due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $89 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $178 million of our stock, representing about 3.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on October 18 to shareholders of record as of September 16. As a reminder, our first-ever dividend was declared on April 6 and will be payable on July 19 to shareholders of record as of June 17. 
Now I'd like to review our updated planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which include our actual first quarter results, recent trends in the business and our purchase of One Kings Lane, which we announced on June 14. 
We are modeling comp sales to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016, with net sales about 170 basis points higher than comp. Just as a reminder, One Kings Lane will be excluded from our comp sales calculations until after the anniversary of the purchase. 
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as we evaluate our free shipping threshold. We continue to expect the 2016 deleverage to be less than that of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a percentage of net sales, primarily as a result of the following items: one, additional payroll startup costs associated with the opening of our Lewisville, Texas distribution facility; two, an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits to preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates in response to wage increases impacting the broader workforce, including in the retail sector; three, store payroll hours comparable to the prior year to support servicing our customers in connection with omnichannel activities, such as online appointment scheduling, the on-store orders, items reserved online and picked up in store, items returned to stores from online purchases and fulfillment from our stores; and four, further investments in technology and in our digital web and mobile capabilities, which will result in an increase in our technology-related expenses, including depreciation. 
We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is estimated to be between $75 million and $80 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, a continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 are planned to be in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. 
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We believe that the level of capital investment required over the next few years should start to come down off of the spending level. 
Our technology-related projects represent a significant portion of our planned CapEx and include enhancements to our digital web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics and the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system. In addition to technology-related projects, the CapEx estimate also includes an estimate for the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas and new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments. 
We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. 
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I've just discussed, which reflect our first quarter results, current business trends and also include the slight dilution anticipated by our recent purchase of One Kings Lane, we believe our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share will still be comfortably within this range.
Also, as I said earlier and as we planned -- explained on our last conference call, our fiscal 2016 quarterly net earnings per diluted share were expected to have a similar pro rata percent to the total year as they have had in previous years, excluding onetime items, with the exception that we believe that the percent for the first quarter would be somewhat lighter and it was. And the fourth quarter contribution to full year earnings is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to holiday shifts and advertising changes.
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability.
Before opening the call to Q&A, we plan to report our 2016 fiscal second quarter results on Wednesday, September 21. Janet?"

For example, we talk about being more experiential, and you look at the design services that they provide, the studio experience that they provide their customers in California, in San Fran and New York. Those are the things that, we think, could have legs also going forward and even -- might even have application in our stores at some point. And then you take a look at the ability to register in certain respects either towards a large gift, offer a gift card, offer specific furniture that could be available on a continuity basis, so what it could mean for our registry business.

So when we look at World Market and we look at what One Kings Lane can do in developing differentiated product, when we look at Christmas Tree and what they've done with differentiated product and our growing product development group at Bed Bath, being about differentiated product is so important to us so that we -- so that it doesn't become just about the price. But again, we can't be at a different price than other people are at. So we have to be at the right price. And when it comes to how do we price, it's an interesting question.

And our buyers and planners, they're reporting each and every day by item, by categories, by vendor. And prices are adjusted on a daily basis, but we are omnichannel. So our ability -- and we're doing dynamic pricing today. Again, at its infancy for us, but we're doing it. But again, it's more difficult for us when it comes to items that you could find both online and in a store because we don't have the capability or the desire really to change prices daily in our stores. So again, so where the product is direct from vendor or is a differentiated product, it's not a concern, but we could be more aggressive. But for the product that you can find in store and online, to the extent that it's changed online and we have to follow suit in store, it's more difficult for us to do that. But again, being at the right price is essential to us."

We know that our gross margin still remains some of the strongest in retail despite the declines. We do know that we do have a competitive set that people today to make decisions not based on short-term profitability, and they run their business as well and they good -- and they're servicing the customer well. So these are things that we have to respond to as well. So it's hard to -- and I know everybody wants to do a model and they want to say at what point in time will the margins turn around or what it's going to look like. But again, when you talk about how we're running the business, things we're investing in, is that -- you look at a number of years ago, and the people -- just a short time ago, when you had all the big boxes, so when you had Borders books, you had Sports Authority, you had CircuitCity, you had all these industry leaders who are no longer around today because -- you know that Toys “R” Us struggles. You go back and you say that what investments do you make and at what point in time and when do they pay you off. Well, we just know in part that we'd be so much better off or we are so much better off with the investments we've made for where the company is today than if we didn't make these investments. So again, we could have chased short-term profitability or short-term comps by buying comps. There's a lot of things that we could be doing. But again, as we've always said and you know as well is that we're building this business from -- for the long term and that we think the foundation is very strong. And if you look around the company, if you walk the offices today, the analytics people, the people have all these Ph.D.s or master's degrees in statistics, the people that are doing product development for us, the people that are doing target marketing, when you look at the people that -- throughout the organization, you look at Of a Kind or you look at One Kings Lane, you look at the Clay [ph] that we have today, the company's never been stronger. And so again, is that -- so I know it's difficult for people who are trying to write a model to say, well, this turns around when. But all I could say is that being here every day and doing this now, entering my 25th year, we've never been stronger, never been a better company. I've never been more excited about what we have. And again, we're going to be great and we're going to do very well. And so -- but when and where it comes out from turning a number around on the bottom line relative to where we are today, those are things that we wish we could tell you and we wish you could model it. But the investments we're making, we're very, very confident and confident in the direction of the company and very confident in our people."

So again -- so I think your critique is fair and accurate, and the criticisms are fair. And the onus is on us to show over time.

When you say is there -- I'm not sure if you asked if there's a goal or objective of where we want to be, but again, the customer will tell us because there's -- we don't pick a number or percentage of our assortment. We really look at it category by category what's the opportunity, what do we - what can we be bringing to market and making -- that makes us different, that has great value, that really adds something to the customers' choices out there, and then we look at other things, like, is it -- can you really make it? I mean, obviously things with a plug or a mold, they're much more difficult to really work on differentiated product. But again, what's the markdown exposure? And so how much do you have to make? So all these things are taken into account. But the objective is really to be great merchants. And to be great merchants, we should be really a leader and bringing differentiated product to market. So it is the objective and objective of every part of the organization, and it's been growing in every part of the organization even if you look at Harmon Face Values, for example, when you look at all the private-label product that we're bringing to market, so again, very, very, very critical for us."

So that how we show things, how we market ourselves, how we communicate with our customer, that we really believe that we have to do a better job, and we think One Kings Lane does a wonderful job of that. So again, we do believe we have to move down the continuum in that way. But at the same time, when we add more product today because of analytics and target marketing and the ability to serve up to a customer something, know where the customer came from online, where they are going to, what their interests are, what they purchase from us, to give them a view that really speaks to that customer so they don't have to be bothered with. If they love to bake, that's what they see our site for and they -- that's what they see our assortment. So we don't have to show them a chicken coop or a snowblower. But for the person who might want to be looking for a chicken coop or snowblower, that we have it for them. So we think that by being smart, that we can do both, that we can extend our offering and to our customers, target them better, to speak to them for their interest in their life stages."

Here are some highlights from our financial results. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.11. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the prior year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.2%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.

I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second",1399,"Thanks, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1.2% in comp sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 1% in non-comp sales including new stores and One Kings Lane.
The decrease in comp sales for the quarter was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. As a reminder, One Kings Lane is excluded from our comp sales calculations and will be until after the anniversary of the purchase.
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the second quarter of last year. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount.
Also contributing to a lesser extent as a percentage of net sales was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, which reflects a reduced free shipping threshold of $29 at Bed Bath & Beyond for much of the quarter. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin by approximately 12 basis points in the second quarter.
SG&A for the second quarter was approximately 28% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses including depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense by approximately 16 basis points in the second quarter.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $18.2 million compared to $25.1 million last year. Approximately $5 million of the decrease resulted from a favorable change in the value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan investment. However, that favorable change was offset by an unfavorable change in SG&A and therefore, the $5 million reduction in net interest expense did not impact net earnings. The remaining decrease of approximately $2 million in net interest expense for the quarter is the result of the realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities, which was included in last year's second quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36.3% compared to approximately 38% in the prior year period. The second quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $2.9 million this year as compared to net after-tax cost of approximately $800,000 last year, due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.11 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with approximately $661 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the end of the prior year period, due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers. 
Our newest facility in Lewisville, Texas opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting it to begin shipping to customers in October. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $185 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investment in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investment in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 6 new stores during the second quarter, including 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 2 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. Since the end of the quarter, we have opened 1 Bed Bath & Beyond and 1 BABY store both in the Canadian province of British Columbia and closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store. In addition, our joint venture in Mexico now operates 8 stores, including the newest store in Morelia, which opened in July 2016.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $121 million of stock, representing about 2.7 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
In addition, we paid our first quarterly dividend in July, and today, our Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.
Now I'd like to review our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which incorporate our year-to-date results, including One Kings Lane and recent business conditions. We are modeling our comp sales change to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016, with the net sales increase to be about 125 to 140 basis points higher than the comp sales change. 
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as well as the inclusion of our models results for One Kings Lane. Even with the inclusion of One Kings Lane, we still expect the 2016 gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than the deleverage of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage primarily due to payroll and payroll-related items including wage increases, further investments in technology including depreciation as well as the inclusion of our model's results for One Kings Lane. We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is now estimated to be $75 million.
We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid-to high 30s percentage range, with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015.
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects.
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completions will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share has been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflects our results through the second quarter, the slight dilution anticipated by our purchase of One Kings Lane and current business trends, we continue to model our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be in this range.
Also as we said before, the fourth quarter contribution of net earnings per diluted share to the full year is anticipated to be somewhat stronger than the similar pro rata percent to the total year it had been in previous years, excluding onetime items, due in part to the additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and advertising changes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven, who will share some highlights of the projects we are making to position Bed Bath & Beyond for continued success. Steven?"

As retail continues to evolve, there's been a democratization of shopping, enabled by technology and the Internet, which has resulted in an ongoing shift in the way the customer shops. We now have more choices, more transparency and more convenience than ever, all resulting in significant investments in technology and dramatic shifts in the retail landscape, highlighted by both new shopping options on one end and retailer consolidation and closing the website and stores on the other.
Over the past several years, in this environment that we have been transforming our company, have laid the groundwork for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer. 
We are making great progress in improving our capabilities everyday. We are taking a systematic and logical approach. We are evolving toward providing a more inspirational and personal shopping experience, with an expanded offering which includes a more differentiated product mix and enhanced services and solutions for our customers. This is to earn the reputation with our customers as the experts for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests. Our investments over the past several years have furthered our foundational ability to do so.
The opportunity to do more forward with our customers have never been greater. At the same time, while we make the investments necessary for our transformation, we remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company.
Today, I'll provide an update on some of the developments since our last call. We announced the purchase of One Kings Lane on June 14, about 2 weeks into the second quarter. As we've said previously, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. We're only a little more than 3 months into the integration process so it's still early but things are progressing as expected. 
We continue to be impressed by the quality and capabilities of the people of One Kings Lane. And we believe that their merchandising expertise and passion for their customers' homes will further enhance both our ability to satisfy and our credibility with our customers.
Over time, we believe One Kings Lane will provide us an opportunity to improve the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through design services and studio locations. We believe the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles.
With respect to differentiated product, Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Tree Shops and Bath and Of a Kind have always had a substantial assortment of proprietary and private-label product that we continue to improve upon. As Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY and One Kings Lane, we have also strived to grow a proprietary offering. And as brands are very important to our customers, we have worked to expand our exclusives or first-to-market opportunities for named brand products.
Some examples of these merchandising initiatives include proprietary or exclusive brands such as Olivia and Oliver and ED by Ellen DeGeneres and Bed Bath & Beyond and Wamsutta Baby and Jonathan crafted by Fisher-Price and buybuy BABY. We also have a growing line of private-label health and beauty care products under the Harmon Face values label. And just this week, One Kings Lane launched the One Kings Lane collection, a line of proprietary furniture and lighting. 
In addition, we now offer more than 3,000 items that could be customized using text, a monogram or personal photos. This personalization service is available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY website, and we will begin to make this available in store through the Beyond store this fall. These items are easy to find under our personalized gifts category and are identified on most shopping pages via an icon or a label that indicates personalization is available. 
There's an even convenient way to create a unique gift or an accent piece for your home. Early customer response has been favorable and we are continuing to add to the assortment of items that can be personalized. We view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional product differentiation and enable us to do more forward with our customers.
We also continue to broaden our merchandise categories online. Some recent examples include other home improvement products such as power tools, kitchen and bath fixtures and silver and gas generators. We also expanded our fitness categories to include treadmill, stationary bikes and other exercise equipments. In the bath department, we have recently increased our assortment of vanity and lighting. And then in our outdoor category, we have added camping gear and equipment.
Differentiation and improvements are paramount for us and this also applies for the services and solutions we provide. We have added more curated experiences to the Bed Bath & Beyond website such as a new category called Designer Picks, which offers an inspirational collection of favorite finds from throughout our websites put together by professional designers. 
Within our shops category, you can find a curated assortment of products and solutions organized by themes such as healthy living, smart innovation and fine linens. We have also added several new lifestyle trends to our LOOK LOVE collection. 
In our Back to College offering this summer, in addition to our popular in-store events and other services such as pack and hold, shop now, ship later and college registry services, we launched Shop With an Expert. This new service enables customers to make an in-store appointment with one of our expert associates to receive personal assistance to get campus ready. Our associates and our website have valuable information regarding thousands of U.S. colleges and in many cases, the details about select dorms on campus.
We also produced our first student life catalog that was mailed in June to a targeted distribution of incoming college freshmen. This 36-page catalog, also available digitally, presented a more inspirational view of the products, services and solutions we offer for this important life stage. We were pleased with the results of this catalog, and we will continue to evolve our targeted marketing efforts in this area.
We have also recently introduced a product expert chat feature on the desktop to select categories on the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites to enhance the online shopping experience and provide customers with an opportunity to interact with one of our expert associates. Currently, we have enabled several categories including car seats, strollers, monitors, coffee and tea makers in cookware. So for example, if you were browsing through items in the car seat category, you will be prompted to chat live with one of our expert associates for further assistance.
Our customer service representatives engaging in live chat undergo additional training to be able to respond to product-specific questions. We have plans to roll additional categories going forward. These new offerings give us an opportunity to elevate our customer service, and as a result, create more stickiness with our customers. We know our customers benefit from our expert associates when they shop with us in-store. Now we are beginning to translate a differentiated level of service and expertise to the digital experience.
As consumer shopping preferences continue to shift to digital, our investments are driving a better omnichannel experience. We have another round of digital upgrades scheduled over the next couple of months. Some examples for Bed Bath & Beyond include extending chat and in-store appointment schedule into a mobile website; adding the ability for our customers to browse the entire site including product and search result pages for a particular item and then further refine their search by what's available in their local store; adding interactive tools to guide our customers to building a registry as well as assisting them in shopping for specific occasions or events; and continue to improve our search experience through enhanced algorithm and data integration.
Our goal is create a seamless and more personalized shopping experience and to present our customers with more relevant product recommendations and offers, not just more products but a more relevant experience. This means we need to serve up our offerings in such a way that resonates with our customers. To that end, our marketing capabilities continue to evolve as we further leverage our robust customer database and third-party data to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities.
For example, our target of lifestyle campaigns for college, new mover, baby and wedding enable us to engage with our customers and present timely and relevant information to them about a specific life stage. These campaigns enhance our ability to be viewed as the expert by communicating the products, services and solutions we offer at a relevant time for the customer. As with everything we do, we strive to improve upon the execution of these campaigns in order to better satisfy our customer, expand our services and achieve greater returns. 
We have also been refining our existing print advertising program and expanding our specialty print pieces including catalogs to drive engagement and enhance product awareness. So far this year, we have published 2 catalogs, Outdoor Living and Student Life. We will soon be releasing a third catalog called Welcome Home, which will showcase the depth and breadth of our product expertise in a more inspirational way than we've ever done before. This 84-page catalog will also be available digitally and includes interactive features to drive further engagements. We're really excited about telling our story and furthering our efforts to be known as the experts for the home.
We have several other marketing initiatives underway this fall, including the rollout of our new cross-concept co-branded credit card and the testing of some additional aspects of a future loyalty program. Our focus on driving a better omnichannel experience also include advancing the rollout and driving adoption of My Offers, our virtual coupon wallet to additional Bed Bath & Beyond customers as well as to our buybuy BABY customers.
We're also evolving our physical channels to further integrate our omnichannel capabilities to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. We want the highlight the service components that reflect how customers are utilizing our stores as well as providing more experiential shopping environment through events such as product demonstrations, how-to sessions, food samplings and cooking classes. 
Our growing list of services include being able to reserve an item online and pick it up in store, being able to return online orders to a store, to have product shipped to your home from a store or to schedule an appointment for wedding and baby registry and to shop with an expert for college. 
In addition, we have introduced new technology in some stores such as a scan-for-more digital tool, which enables a customer to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; our interactive catalogs, which enables customers to view a curated assortment of products such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and our digital product advisory tools, which enables customers to find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs.
We've also talked previously about our newly-located Bed Bath & Beyond stores at Hyannis, Massachusetts and our new store in Kennesaw, Georgia. These are other examples of how we are revolving our physical footprint by testing and bringing differentiated products, services and solutions including new technologies to our stores. We continue to learn and transition our stores over time.
We are set to open our newest retail space in Brooklyn in November. Liberty View Industrial Park is the setting for this unique shopping venue, which will include a Bed Bath & Beyond, a buybuy BABY, a Cost Plus World Market and a Harmon store all under one roof. We're excited about this new iteration of the blending of our physical and digital capabilities as we move towards a more experiential shopping environment.
And finally, regarding our newest retail distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As Sue mentioned, this new facility opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting to begin shipping to customers in October. Over time, this 800,000-square-foot facility will be able to fit orders for all our concepts and improve our overall delivery capabilities. We continue to assess supply chain network for opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies as we build world-class fulfillment capabilities.
We remained on course this quarter as we continued to strategically navigate the ever-evolving retail landscape. We remain focused on our customers and what we need to do to earn still more relevancy and to become their destination as the experts for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests. 
It's a transitional time for retail and many retailers including us are experiencing pressure on their operating margins. Despite the fact that we continue to achieve among the highest profit margins in retail, we too have experienced downward pressures on our financial results as our transformation continues. During this evolution, we've recognized that we must remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company while returning value to our shareholders.
We have spoken a lot today about differentiation. Nowhere is it more important than it is with our people. Our historical success and the success we will achieve in the future is due to our dedicated, hard-working, intellectually honest, intellectually curious and never satisfied associates. I'd like to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business.
I'll now turn the call back over to Janet so we can move forward with our Q&A portion of our call."

But when you talk about noncore categories, Alan, we wouldn't all e-commerce our noncore category. E-commerce is a core category for us. I mean, again, how we reach the customer, how we do more with the customer, how do we satisfy the customer, the digital experience is part of the entire experience, and we have to be great at it. So -- but again, the things that we're doing, we do tend to do things incrementally. When you mentioned or when Kate mentioned acquisition, the things that we purchased were always done in a way that we didn't have to [indiscernible] on it. We always have to test the something to make it work, to get better at it and to roll it forward. Similarly, all the things that we're doing with these categories that -- they're very -- they're not highly -- they're not risk in the sense that if it's furniture, home decor, it's vendor direct for the most part. The categories that we're bringing in and how we show them, we do them in a way that is not to the detriment of our core categories so it doesn't confuse the customer or [indiscernible] the site in a way they can't find what they're looking for. So even as we add categories to our website, it's very important that we improve the left side and our marketing and communication and personalization, so that the customer can find what they're looking for. We're not just adding a bunch of nonsense to customers or noise to a customer. So everything we do is with an eyes towards being better in the eyes of the customer and with an eye towards not betting the house on anything and doing things systematically, deductively, logically, testing them out, proving them out and then rolling them forward."

So -- but we do have the objective to drive differentiated product. You probably heard this from us before and everybody will cringe, but differentiated product is life and death to us. So it really is -- so if you look at Bed Bath & Beyond, which does depend a lot on branded products, we work on lead time first to market with product, but we've worked very hard on, if you look at artisanal or you look at bedding or you look at what we've done with Wamsutta, very important. You look at concepts like Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Trees Shop and Bath, largely proprietary, significant proprietary projects -- products. If you look at One Kings Lane and that we've now launched this private-label program, if you look across Harmon, where we measure costs and growing our private-label product. In each of the categories that we do business in, it's essential for us to drive differentiated product and to, over time, be known for it. But we don't set a goal because it comes down to what we're able to execute and customer acceptance of it. So in certain categories, things that you have applaud, it's very difficult for us to drive a lot of differentiated product. So I can't answer the question with a percentage or a number, but I can tell you that it's larger in certain businesses, smaller in others and being driven passionately across all."

Our earnings press release dated September 21, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some highlights from our financial results. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.11. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the prior year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.2%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016. Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we described in our previous earnings press releases.
I will now turn the call over to Sue, who will review our second quarter financial results and our fiscal 2016 key modeling assumptions. Steven will then discuss some of the notable developments relating to our strategic initiatives. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to questions. I'll now turn the call over to Sue."

I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second",1400,"Thanks, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1.2% in comp sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 1% in noncomp sales including new stores and One Kings Lane.
The decrease in comp sales for the quarter was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. As a reminder, One Kings Lane is excluded from our comp sales calculations and will be until after the anniversary of the purchase.
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the second quarter of last year. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount.
Also contributing to a lesser extent as a percentage of net sales was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, which reflects a reduced free shipping threshold of $29 at Bed Bath & Beyond for much of the quarter. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin by approximately 12 basis points in the second quarter.
SG&A for the second quarter was approximately 28% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense by approximately 16 basis points in the second quarter.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $18.2 million compared to $25.1 million last year. Approximately $5 million of the decrease resulted from a favorable change in the value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan investment. However, that favorable change was offset by an unfavorable change in SG&A, and therefore, the $5 million reduction in net interest expense did not impact net earnings. The remaining decrease of approximately $2 million in net interest expense for the quarter is the result of the realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities, which was included in last year's second quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36.3% compared to approximately 38% in the prior year period. The second quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $2.9 million this year as compared to net after-tax cost of approximately $800,000 last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.11 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with approximately $661 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the end of the prior year period, due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers.
Our newest facility in Lewisville, Texas opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting it to begin shipping to customers in October. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $185 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investment in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 6 new stores during the second quarter, including 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 2 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. Since the end of the quarter, we have opened 1 Bed Bath & Beyond and 1 BABY store both in the Canadian province of British Columbia and closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store. In addition, our joint venture in Mexico now operates 8 stores, including the newest store in Morelia, which opened in July 2016.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $121 million of stock, representing about 2.7 million shares, under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
In addition, we paid our first quarterly dividend in July. And today, our Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.
Now I'd like to review our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which incorporate our year-to-date results, including One Kings Lane, and recent business conditions. We are modeling our comp sales change to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016 with the net sales increase to be about 125 to 140 basis points higher than the comp sales change.
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as well as the inclusion of our model's results for One Kings Lane. Even with the inclusion of One Kings Lane, we still expect the 2016 gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than the deleverage of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage primarily due to payroll and payroll-related items, including wage increases; further investments in technology, including depreciation; as well as the inclusion of our model's results for One Kings Lane. We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is now estimated to be $75 million.
We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015.
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects.
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completions will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share has been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflects our results through the second quarter, the slight dilution anticipated by our purchase of One Kings Lane and current business trends, we continue to model our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be in this range.
Also as we said before, the fourth quarter contribution of net earnings per diluted share to the full year is anticipated to be somewhat stronger than the similar pro rata percent to the total year it had been in previous years, excluding onetime items, due in part to the additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and advertising changes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven, who will share some highlights of the progress we are making to position Bed Bath & Beyond for continued success. Steven?"

As retailing continues to evolve, there has been a democratization of shopping enabled by technology and the Internet, which has resulted in an ongoing shift in the way the customer shops. We now have more choices, more transparency and more convenience than ever, all resulting in significant investments in technology and dramatic shifts in the retail landscape, highlighted by both new shopping options on one end and retailer consolidation and closings of website and stores on the other.
Over the past several years, in this environment, we have been transforming our company and have laid the groundwork for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer.
We are making great progress in improving our capabilities every day. We are taking a systematic and logical approach. We are evolving toward providing a more inspirational and personal shopping experience with an expanded offering, which includes a more differentiated product mix and enhanced services and solutions for our customers. This is to earn the reputation with our customers as the expert for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests. Our investments over the past several years have furthered our foundational ability to do so.
The opportunity to do more forward with our customers have never been greater. At the same time, while we make the investments necessary for our transformation, we remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company.
Today, I will provide an update on some of the developments since our last call. We announced the purchase of One Kings Lane on June 14, about 2 weeks into the second quarter. As we've said previously, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. We are only a little more than 3 months into the integration process, so it's still early but things are progressing as expected.
We continue to be impressed by the quality and capabilities of the people of One Kings Lane. And we believe that their merchandising expertise and passion for their customers' homes will further enhance both our ability to satisfy and our credibility with our customers.
Over time, we believe One Kings Lane will provide us an opportunity to improve the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through design services and studio locations. We believe the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles.
With respect to differentiated product, Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Tree Shops, andThat! and Of a Kind have always had a substantial assortment of proprietary and private-label product that we continue to improve upon. At Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Harmon Face Values and One Kings Lane, we have also strived to grow a proprietary offering. And as brands are very important to our customers, we have worked to expand our exclusives or first-to-market opportunities for named brand products.
Some examples of these merchandising initiatives include proprietary or exclusive brands such as Wamsutta, Olivia & Oliver and ED by Ellen DeGeneres in Bed Bath & Beyond and Wamsutta BABY and Jonathan Adler Crafted by Fisher Price in buybuy BABY. We also have a growing line of private-label health and beauty care products under the Harmon Face Values label. And just this week, One Kings Lane launched the One Kings Lane Collection, a line of proprietary furniture and lighting.
In addition, we now offer more than 3,000 items that could be customized using text, a monogram or personal photos. This personalization service is available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites, and we will begin to make it available in store through the Beyond store this fall. These items are easy to find under our personalized gifts category and are identified on most shopping pages via an icon or a label that indicates personalization is available.
There's an easy and convenient way to create a unique gift or accent piece for your home. Early customer response has been favorable, and we are continuing to add to the assortment of items that can be personalized. We view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional product differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers.
We also continue to broaden our merchandise categories online. Some recent examples include other home improvement products such as power tools, kitchen and bath fixtures and solar and gas generators. We also expanded our fitness category to include treadmill, stationary bikes and other exercise equipment. In the bath department, we have recently increased our assortment of vanity and lighting. And in our outdoor category, we have added camping gear and equipment.
Differentiation and constant improvements are paramount for us, and this also applies to the services and solutions we provide. We have added more curated experiences to the Bed Bath & Beyond website such as a new category called Designer Picks, which offers an inspirational collection of favorite finds from throughout our websites put together by professional designers.
Within our shops category, you can find a curated assortment of products and solutions organized by themes such as healthy living, smart innovation and fine linens. We have also added several new lifestyle trends to our LOOK LOVE collection.
In our Back to College offering this summer, in addition to our popular in-store events and other services such as Pack & Hold, Shop Now, Ship Later and College Registry services, we launched Shop With an Expert. This new service enables customers to make an in-store appointment with one of our expert associates to receive personal assistance to get campus-ready. Our associates and our website have valuable information regarding thousands of U.S. colleges and in many cases, the details about select dorms on campus.
We also produced our first Student Life catalog that was mailed in June to a targeted distribution of incoming college freshmen. This 36-page catalog, also available digitally, presented a more inspirational view of the products, services and solutions we offer for this important life stage. We were pleased with the results of this catalog, and we will continue to evolve our targeted marketing efforts in this area.
We have also recently introduced a product expert chat feature on the desktop to select categories on the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites to enhance the online shopping experience and provide customers with an opportunity to interact with one of our expert associates. Currently, we have enabled several categories, including car seats, strollers, monitors, coffee and tea makers and cookware. So for example, if you were browsing through items in the car seat category, you will be prompted to chat live with one of our expert associates for further assistance.
Our customer service representatives engaging in live chat undergo additional training to be able to respond to product-specific questions. We have plans to roll out additional categories going forward. These new offerings give us an opportunity to elevate our customer service, and as a result, create more stickiness with our customers. We know our customers benefit from our expert associates when they shop with us in store. Now we are beginning to translate a differentiated level of service and expertise to the digital experience.
As consumer shopping preferences continue to shift to digital, our investments are driving a better omnichannel experience. We have another round of digital upgrades scheduled over the next couple of months. Some examples for Bed Bath & Beyond include extending chat and in-store appointment schedule into a mobile website; adding the ability for our customers to browse the entire site, including product list and search result pages for a particular item and then further refine their search by what's available in their local store; adding interactive tools to guide our customers through building a registry as well as assisting them in shopping for specific occasions or events; and continuing to improve our search experience through enhanced algorithm and data integration.
Our goal is create a seamless and more personalized shopping experience and to present our customers with more relevant product recommendations and offers, not just more products but a more relevant experience. This means we need to serve up our offerings in such a way that resonates with our customers. To that end, our marketing capabilities continue to evolve as we further leverage our robust customer database and third-party data to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities.
For example, our targeted lifestyle campaigns for college, new mover, baby and wedding enable us to engage with our customers and present timely and relevant information to them about a specific life stage. These campaigns enhance our ability to be viewed as the expert by communicating the products, services and solutions we offer at a relevant time for the customer. As with everything we do, we strive to improve upon the execution of these campaigns in order to better satisfy our customer, expand our services and achieve greater returns.
We have also been refining our existing print advertising program and expanding our specialty print pieces, including catalogs, to drive engagement and enhance product awareness. So far this year, we have published 2 catalogs, Outdoor Living and Student Life. We will soon be releasing a third catalog called Welcome Home [ph], which will showcase the depth and breadth of our product expertise in a more inspirational way than we've ever done before. This 84-page catalog will also be available digitally and includes interactive features to drive further engagements. We're really excited about telling our story and furthering our efforts to be known as the expert for the home.
We have several other marketing initiatives underway this fall, including the rollout of our new cross-concept co-branded credit card and the testing of some additional aspects of a future loyalty program. Our focus on driving a better omnichannel experience also includes advancing the rollout and driving adoption of My Offers, our virtual coupon wallet, to additional Bed Bath & Beyond customers as well as to our buybuy BABY customers.
We're also evolving our physical channels to further integrate our omnichannel capabilities to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. We want to highlight the service components that reflect how customers are utilizing our stores as well as providing more experiential shopping environment through events such as product demonstrations, how-to sessions, food samplings and cooking classes.
Our growing list of services include being able to reserve an item online and pick it up in store, being able to return online orders to a store, to have product shipped to your home from a store or to schedule an appointment for wedding and baby registry and to shop with an expert for college.
In addition, we have introduced new technology in some stores such as a scan-for-more digital tool, which enables a customer to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; our interactive catalogs, which enables customers to view a curated assortment of products such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and our digital product advisory tool, which enables customers to find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs.
We've also talked previously about our newly located Bed Bath & Beyond store at Hyannis, Massachusetts and our new andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia. These are other examples of how we are evolving our physical footprint by testing and bringing differentiated products, services and solutions, including new technologies, to our stores. We continue to learn and transition our stores over time.
We are set to open our newest retail space in Brooklyn in November. Liberty View Industrial Park is the setting for this unique shopping venue, which will include a Bed Bath & Beyond, a buybuy BABY, a Cost Plus World Market and a Harmon store all under one roof. We're excited about this new iteration of the blending of our physical and digital capabilities as we move towards a more experiential shopping environment.
And finally, regarding our newest retail distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As Sue mentioned, this new facility opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting to begin shipping to customers in October. Over time, this 800,000-square-foot facility will be able to fill orders for all our concepts and improve our overall delivery capabilities. We continue to assess our supply chain network for opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies as we build world-class fulfillment capabilities.
We remained on course this quarter as we continued to strategically navigate the ever-evolving retail landscape. We remain focused on our customers and what we need to do to earn still more relevancy and to become their destination as the expert for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests.
It's a transitional time for retail, and many retailers, including us, are experiencing pressure on their operating margins. Despite the fact that we continue to achieve among the highest profit margins in retail, we, too, have experienced downward pressures on our financial results as our transformation continues. During this evolution, we've recognized that we must remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company while returning value to our shareholders.
We have spoken a lot today about differentiation. Nowhere is it more important than it is with our people. Our historical success and the success we will achieve in the future is due to our dedicated, hard-working, intellectually honest, intellectually curious and never satisfied associates. I'd like to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business.
I'll now turn the call back over to Janet so that we can move forward with our Q&A portion of our call."

So -- but again, the things that we're doing, we do tend to do things incrementally. When you mentioned -- or when Kate mentioned acquisition, the things that we purchased were always done in a way that we didn't bet the farm on it, that we always try to test into something to make it work, to get better at it and to roll it forward. Similarly, all the things that we're doing with these categories, they're very -- they're not highly -- they're not risky in the sense that if it's furniture or home decor, it's vendor direct for the most part. The categories that we're bringing in and how we show them, we do them in a way that is not to the detriment of our core categories so it doesn't confuse the customer but doesn't busy the site in a way that they can't find what they're looking for. So even as we add categories to our website, it's very important that we improve the website and our marketing and communication and personalization so that the customer can find what they're looking for. We're not just adding a bunch of nonsense to customers or noise to a customer. So everything we do is with an eye towards being better in the eyes of the customer and with an eye towards not betting the house on anything but doing things systematically, deductively, logically, testing them out, proving them out and then rolling them forward."

You're obviously adding stuff to have a bigger presence with -- or potentially a greater share of wallet with the customer. But what -- how do you think about your position in the marketplace? What's Bed Bath's angle? Is it going to be price on these new items? Is it assortment? Is it content? And how do you get recognition for those categories? I mean, I just did a quick search on some of those items that you mentioned, Bed Bath doesn't immediately come up as the top place to buy those items.

And the other -- the further you move from the trunk of the tree out to the branches, the more difficult it is to tell the story. But when we're adding lighting and furniture and those types of categories, those will be easier for us. But for someone to look -- like for the chicken coop, that will be less likely. But again, it -- so -- but we're not in a rush to make a mistake. We have to do it right and be diligent about it. We also have to better all these vendors that are vendor direct to make sure that they could ship, they could ship on time, that their product is what they say it is, that the customers' experiences are good before we want to be out there pounding our chest that we have it.

So it really is -- so if you look at Bed Bath & Beyond, which does depend a lot on branded products, we work on lead time first to market with product. But we've worked very hard on, if you look at artisanal or you look at bedding or you look at what we've done with Wamsutta, very important. You look at concepts like Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Trees Shop, andThat!, largely proprietary, significant proprietary projects -- products. If you look at One Kings Lane and that we've now launched this private-label program, if you look across Harmon, where we measure costs and growing our private-label product, in each of the categories that we do business in, it's essential for us to drive differentiated product and to, over time, be known for it. But we don't set a goal because it comes down to what we're able to execute and customer acceptance of it. So in certain categories, things that you have a plug, it's very difficult for us to drive a lot of differentiated product.

Here are some highlights from our financial results. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.11. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the prior year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.2%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016. Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we described in our previous earnings press releases.
I will now turn the call over to Sue, who will review our second quarter financial results and our fiscal 2016 key modeling assumptions. Steven will then discuss some of the notable developments relating to our strategic initiatives. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to questions. I'll now turn the call over to Sue."

I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second",1400,"Thanks, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1.2% in comp sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 1% in noncomp sales including new stores and One Kings Lane.
The decrease in comp sales for the quarter was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. As a reminder, One Kings Lane is excluded from our comp sales calculations and will be until after the anniversary of the purchase.
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the second quarter of last year. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount.
Also contributing to a lesser extent as a percentage of net sales was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, which reflects a reduced free shipping threshold of $29 at Bed Bath & Beyond for much of the quarter. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin by approximately 12 basis points in the second quarter.
SG&A for the second quarter was approximately 28% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense by approximately 16 basis points in the second quarter.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $18.2 million compared to $25.1 million last year. Approximately $5 million of the decrease resulted from a favorable change in the value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan investment. However, that favorable change was offset by an unfavorable change in SG&A, and therefore, the $5 million reduction in net interest expense did not impact net earnings. The remaining decrease of approximately $2 million in net interest expense for the quarter is the result of the realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities, which was included in last year's second quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36.3% compared to approximately 38% in the prior year period. The second quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $2.9 million this year as compared to net after-tax cost of approximately $800,000 last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.11 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with approximately $661 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the end of the prior year period, due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers.
Our newest facility in Lewisville, Texas opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting it to begin shipping to customers in October. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $185 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investment in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 6 new stores during the second quarter, including 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 2 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. Since the end of the quarter, we have opened 1 Bed Bath & Beyond and 1 BABY store both in the Canadian province of British Columbia and closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store. In addition, our joint venture in Mexico now operates 8 stores, including the newest store in Morelia, which opened in July 2016.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $121 million of stock, representing about 2.7 million shares, under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
In addition, we paid our first quarterly dividend in July. And today, our Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.
Now I'd like to review our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016 which incorporate our year-to-date results, including One Kings Lane, and recent business conditions. We are modeling our comp sales change to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016 with the net sales increase to be about 125 to 140 basis points higher than the comp sales change.
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as well as the inclusion of our model's results for One Kings Lane. Even with the inclusion of One Kings Lane, we still expect the 2016 gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than the deleverage of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage primarily due to payroll and payroll-related items, including wage increases; further investments in technology, including depreciation; as well as the inclusion of our model's results for One Kings Lane. We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is now estimated to be $75 million.
We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015.
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects.
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completions will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflects our results through the second quarter, the slight dilution anticipated by our purchase of One Kings Lane and current business trends, we continue to model our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be in this range.
Also, as we said before, the fourth quarter contribution of net earnings per diluted share to the full year is anticipated to be somewhat stronger than the similar pro rata percent to the total year it had been in previous years, excluding onetime items, due in part to the additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and advertising changes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven, who will share some highlights of the progress we are making to position Bed Bath & Beyond for continued success. Steven?"

As retailing continues to evolve, there has been a democratization of shopping enabled by technology and the Internet, which has resulted in an ongoing shift in the way the customer shops. We now have more choices, more transparency and more convenience than ever, all resulting in significant investments in technology and dramatic shifts in the retail landscape, highlighted by both new shopping options on one end and retailer consolidation and closings of websites and stores on the other.
Over the past several years, it's in this environment that we have been transforming our company and have laying the groundwork for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer.
We are making great progress in improving our capabilities every day. We are taking a systematic and logical approach. We are evolving toward providing a more inspirational and personal shopping experience with an expanded offering, which includes a more differentiated product mix and enhanced services and solutions for our customers. This is to earn a reputation with our customers as the expert for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests. Our investments over the past several years have furthered our foundational ability to do so.
The opportunity to do more for and with our customers have never been greater. At the same time, while we make the investments necessary for our transformation, we remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company.
Today, I will provide an update on some of the developments since our last call. We announced the purchase of One Kings Lane on June 14, about 2 weeks into the second quarter. As we've said previously, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. We are only a little more than 3 months into the integration process, so it's still early but things are progressing as expected.
We continue to be impressed by the quality and capabilities of the people of One Kings Lane. And we believe that their merchandising expertise and passion for their customers' homes will further enhance both our ability to satisfy and our credibility with our customers.
Over time, we believe One Kings Lane will provide us an opportunity to improve the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through design services and studio locations. We believe the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated product to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles.
With respect to differentiated product, Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Tree Shops, andThat! and Of a Kind have always had a substantial assortment of proprietary and private-label products that we continue to improve upon. At Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Harmon Face Values and One Kings Lane, we have also strived to grow a proprietary offering. And as brands are very important to our customers, we have worked to expand our exclusives or first-to-market opportunities for named brand products.
Some examples of these merchandising initiatives include proprietary or exclusive brands such as Wamsutta, Olivia & Oliver and ED by Ellen DeGeneres in Bed Bath & Beyond and Wamsutta BABY and Jonathan Adler Crafted by Fisher Price in buybuy BABY. We also have a growing line of private-label health and beauty care products under the Harmon Face Values label. And just this week, One Kings Lane launched the One Kings Lane Collection, a line of proprietary furniture and lighting.
In addition, we now offer more than 3,000 items that could be customized using text, a monogram or personal photos. This personalization service is available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites, and we will begin to make it available in store through the Beyond store this fall. These items are easy to find under our personalized gifts category and are identified on most shopping pages via an icon or a label that indicates personalization is available.
It's an easy and convenient way to create a unique gift or accent piece for your home. Early customer response has been favorable, and we are continuing to add to the assortment of items that can be personalized. We view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional product differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers.
We also continue to broaden our merchandise categories online. Some recent examples include other home improvement products such as power tools, kitchen and bath fixtures and solar and gas generators. We also expanded our fitness category to include treadmill, stationary bikes and other exercise equipment. In the bath department, we have recently increased our assortment of vanity and lighting. And in our outdoor category, we have added camping gear and equipment.
Differentiation and constant improvements are paramount for us, and this also applies to the services and solutions we provide. We have added more curated experiences to the Bed Bath & Beyond website such as a new category called Designer Picks, which offers an inspirational collection of favorite finds from throughout our websites put together by professional designers.
Within our shops category, you can find a curated assortment of products and solutions organized by themes such as healthy living, smart innovation and fine linens. We have also added several new lifestyle trends to our LOOK LOVE collection.
In our Back to College offering this summer, in addition to our popular in-store events and other services such as Pack & Hold, Shop Now, Ship Later and College Registry services, we have launched Shop With an Expert. This new service enables customers to make an in-store appointment with one of our expert associates to receive personal assistance to get campus-ready. Our associates and our website have valuable information regarding thousands of U.S. colleges and in many cases, the details about select dorms on campus.
We also produced our first Student Life catalog that was mailed in June to a targeted distribution of incoming college freshmen. This 36-page catalog, also available digitally, presented a more inspirational view of the products, services and solutions we offer for this important life stage. We were pleased with the results of this catalog, and we will continue to evolve our targeted marketing efforts in this area.
We have also recently introduced a product expert chat feature on the desktop to select categories on the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites to enhance the online shopping experience and provide customers with an opportunity to interact with one of our expert associates. Currently, we have enabled several categories, including car seats, strollers, monitors, coffee and tea makers and cookware. So for example, if you were browsing through items in the car seat category, you will be prompted to chat live with one of our expert associates for further assistance.
Our customer service representatives engaging in live chat undergo additional training to be able to respond to product-specific questions. We have plans to roll out additional categories going forward. These new offerings give us an opportunity to elevate our customer service, and as a result, create more stickiness with our customers. We know our customers benefit from our expert associates when they shop with us in store. Now we are beginning to translate a differentiated level of service and expertise to the digital experience.
As consumer shopping preferences continue to shift to digital, our investments are driving a better omnichannel experience. We have another round of digital upgrades scheduled over the next couple of months. Some examples for Bed Bath & Beyond include extending chat and in-store appointment schedule into our mobile website; adding the ability for our customers to browse the entire site, including product list and search result pages for a particular item and then further refine their search by what's available in their local store; adding interactive tools to guide our customers through building a registry as well as assisting them in shopping for specific occasions or events; and continuing to improve our search experience through enhanced algorithm and data integration.
Our goal is create a seamless and more personalized shopping experience and to present our customers with more relevant product recommendations and offers -- not just more products but a more relevant experience. This means we need to serve up our offerings in such a way that resonates with our customers. To that end, our marketing capabilities continue to evolve as we further leverage our robust customer database and third-party data to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities.
For example, our targeted lifestyle campaigns for college, new mover, baby and wedding enable us to engage with our customers and present timely and relevant information to them about a specific life stage. These campaigns enhance our ability to be viewed as an expert by communicating the products, services and solutions we offer at a relevant time for the customer. As with everything we do, we strive to improve upon the execution of these campaigns in order to better satisfy our customer, expand our services and achieve greater returns.
We have also been refining our existing print advertising program and expanding our specialty print pieces, including catalogs, to drive engagement and enhance product awareness. So far this year, we have published 2 catalogs, Outdoor Living and Student Life. We will soon be releasing a third catalog called Welcome Home, which will showcase the depth and breadth of our product expertise in a more inspirational way than we've ever done before. This 84-page catalog will also be available digitally and includes interactive features to drive further engagements. We're really excited about telling our story and furthering our efforts to be known as the expert for the home.
We have several other marketing initiatives underway this fall, including the rollout of our new cross-concept co-branded credit card and the testing of some additional aspects of a future loyalty program. Our focus on driving a better omnichannel experience also includes advancing the rollout and driving adoption of My Offers, our virtual coupon wallet, to additional Bed Bath & Beyond customers as well as to our buybuy BABY customers.
We're also evolving our physical channels to further integrate our omnichannel capabilities to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. We want to highlight the service components that reflect how customers are utilizing our stores as well as provide a more experiential shopping environment through events such as product demonstrations, how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes.
Our growing list of services include being able to reserve an item online and pick it up in store, being able to return online orders to a store, to have product shipped to your home from a store or to schedule an appointment for wedding and baby registry and to shop with an expert for college.
In addition, we have introduced new technology in some stores such as a scan-for-more digital tool, which enables a customer to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; our interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view a curated assortment of products such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and our digital product advisory tool, which enables customers to find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs.
We've also talked previously about our newly located Bed Bath & Beyond store at Hyannis, Massachusetts and our new andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia. These are other examples of how we are evolving our physical footprint by testing and bringing differentiated products, services and solutions, including new technologies, to our stores. We continue to learn and transition our stores over time.
We are set to open our newest retail space in Brooklyn in November. Liberty View Industrial Park is the setting for this unique shopping venue, which will include a Bed Bath & Beyond, a buybuy BABY, a Cost Plus World Market and a Harmon store all under one roof. We're excited about this new iteration of the blending of our physical and digital capabilities as we move towards a more experiential shopping environment.
And finally, regarding our newest retail distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As Sue mentioned, this new facility opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting to begin shipping to customers in October. Over time, this 800,000-square-foot facility will be able to fill orders for all our concepts and improve our overall delivery capabilities. We continue to assess our supply chain network for opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies as we build world-class fulfillment capabilities.
We remained on course this quarter as we continued to strategically navigate the ever-evolving retail landscape. We remain focused on our customers and what we need to do to earn still more relevancy and to become their destination as the expert for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests.
It's a transitional time for retail, and many retailers, including us, are experiencing pressure on their operating margins. Despite the fact that we continue to achieve among the highest profit margins in retail, we, too, have experienced downward pressures on our financial results as our transformation continues. During this evolution, we've recognized that we must remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company while returning value to our shareholders.
We have spoken a lot today about differentiation. Nowhere is it more important than it is with our people. Our historical success and the success we will achieve in the future is due to our dedicated, hard-working, intellectually honest, intellectually curious and never satisfied associates. I'd like to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business.
I'll now turn the call back over to Janet so that we can move forward with our Q&A portion of our call."

There are certain things that indicated good strength. We measure the number of events, the number of attendees at events, the number of high school kids we reached, the number of Pack & Holds we do. From a sales perspective, it's a little bit more difficult for us to measure it because we peg items each year that we call Back to College items, and they don't -- they're not the same necessarily year-to-year. And sometimes, even additional categories might drop off or get added year-over-year. So when we look at the entire quarter, which was relatively flat for us, I think it's fair to say that directionally, to conclude that our Back to College business is probably similar."

The Bed Bath business that we developed was a very profitable business. And basically, a lot of the things -- and basically, I think, that we've added of significance has been -- impacted the margins that we operate under. But when you talk about noncore categories, Alan, we wouldn't call e-commerce our noncore category. E-commerce is a core category for us. I mean, again, how we reach the customer, how we do more with the customer, how do we satisfy the customer, the digital experience is part of the entire experience, and we have to be great at it. So -- but again, the things that we're doing, we do tend to do things incrementally. When you mentioned -- or when Kate mentioned acquisition, the things that we purchased were always done in a way that we didn't bet the farm on it, that we always try to test into something to make it work, to get better at it and to roll it forward. Similarly, all the things that we're doing with these categories, they're very -- they're not highly -- they're not risky in the sense that if it's furniture or home decor, it's vendor direct for the most part. The categories that we're bringing in and how we show them, we do them in a way that is not to the detriment of our core categories so it doesn't confuse the customer but doesn't busy the site in a way that they can't find what they're looking for. So even as we add categories to our website, it's very important that we improve the website and our marketing and communication and personalization so that the customer can find what they're looking for. We're not just adding a bunch of nonsense to customers or noise to a customer. So everything we do is with an eye towards being better in the eyes of the customer and with an eye towards not betting the house on anything but doing things systematically, deductively, logically, testing them out, proving them out and then rolling them forward."

But we do have the objective to drive differentiated product. I think you probably heard this from us before and everybody will cringe, but differentiated product is life and death to us. So it really is -- so if you look at Bed Bath & Beyond, which does depend a lot on branded products, we work on lead time first to market with product. But we've worked very hard on it, if you look at artisanal or you look at bedding or you look at what we've done with Wamsutta, very important. You look at concepts like Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Trees Shop, andThat!, largely proprietary, significant proprietary projects -- products. If you look at One Kings Lane and that we've now launched this private-label program, if you look across Harmon, where we measure costs and growing our private-label products, in each of the categories that we do business in, it's essential for us to drive differentiated product and to, over time, be known for it. But we don't set a goal because it comes down to what we're able to execute and customer acceptance of it. So in certain categories, things that you have a plug, it's very difficult for us to drive a lot of differentiated product. So I can't answer the question with a percentage or a number, but I can tell you that it's larger in certain businesses, smaller in others and being driven passionately across all."

Our earnings press release dated September 21, 2016, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some highlights from our financial results. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.11. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the prior year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.2%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016. Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be within the range we described in our previous earnings press releases.
I will now turn the call over to Sue, who will review our second quarter financial results and our fiscal 2016 key modeling assumptions. Steven will then discuss some of the notable developments relating to our strategic initiatives. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to questions. I'll now turn the call over to Sue."

I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second",1400,"Thanks, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results, which include the activity of One Kings Lane from June 14. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, a decrease of 0.2% from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1.2% in comp sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 1% in noncomp sales including new stores and One Kings Lane.
The decrease in comp sales for the quarter was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. As a reminder, One Kings Lane is excluded from our comp sales calculations and will be until after the anniversary of the purchase.
Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the second quarter, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
Gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 37.4% as compared to approximately 38.1% of net sales in the second quarter of last year. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense as a result of an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount.
Also contributing to a lesser extent as a percentage of net sales was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, which reflects a reduced free shipping threshold of $29 at Bed Bath & Beyond for much of the quarter. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin by approximately 12 basis points in the second quarter.
SG&A for the second quarter was approximately 28% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.4% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology-related expenses, including depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense by approximately 16 basis points in the second quarter.
Net interest expense for the quarter was approximately $18.2 million compared to $25.1 million last year. Approximately $5 million of the decrease resulted from a favorable change in the value of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan investment. However, that favorable change was offset by an unfavorable change in SG&A, and therefore, the $5 million reduction in net interest expense did not impact net earnings. The remaining decrease of approximately $2 million in net interest expense for the quarter is the result of the realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities, which was included in last year's second quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 36.3% compared to approximately 38% in the prior year period. The second quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $2.9 million this year as compared to net after-tax cost of approximately $800,000 last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.11 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with approximately $661 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1% compared to the end of the prior year period, due in part to the growth in the inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers.
Our newest facility in Lewisville, Texas opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting it to begin shipping to customers in October. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of fiscal 2016 were approximately $185 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investment in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 6 new stores during the second quarter, including 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 2 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. Since the end of the quarter, we have opened 1 Bed Bath & Beyond and 1 BABY store both in the Canadian province of British Columbia and closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store. In addition, our joint venture in Mexico now operates 8 stores, including the newest store in Morelia, which opened in July 2016.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $121 million of stock, representing about 2.7 million shares, under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
In addition, we paid our first quarterly dividend in July. And today, our Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016.
Now I'd like to review our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016 which incorporate our year-to-date results, including One Kings Lane, and recent business conditions. We are modeling our comp sales change to be in the range of relatively flat to a 1% increase for fiscal 2016 with the net sales increase to be about 125 to 140 basis points higher than the comp sales change.
We are modeling gross margin deleverage, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense as well as the inclusion of our model's results for One Kings Lane. Even with the inclusion of One Kings Lane, we still expect the 2016 gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than the deleverage of 2015.
We are modeling SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage primarily due to payroll and payroll-related items, including wage increases; further investments in technology, including depreciation; as well as the inclusion of our model's results for One Kings Lane. We estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year. Annual net interest expense is now estimated to be $75 million.
We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. We anticipate less favorable distinct tax dollars in 2016 as compared to 2015.
We remain on track to open approximately 30 new stores across all concepts and close about 15 stores. Most of our store openings are planned in new markets for our various concepts. Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects.
As we previously said, we anticipate our current period of heavy CapEx investment to reach a peak in fiscal 2016. We plan to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization. We continue to anticipate the completion of this program to occur in the latter half of fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completions will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflects our results through the second quarter, the slight dilution anticipated by our purchase of One Kings Lane and current business trends, we continue to model our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be in this range.
Also, as we said before, the fourth quarter contribution of net earnings per diluted share to the full year is anticipated to be somewhat stronger than the similar pro rata percent to the total year it had been in previous years, excluding onetime items, due in part to the additional shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and advertising changes.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven, who will share some highlights of the progress we are making to position Bed Bath & Beyond for continued success. Steven?"

As retailing continues to evolve, there has been a democratization of shopping enabled by technology and the Internet, which has resulted in an ongoing shift in the way the customer shops. We now have more choices, more transparency and more convenience than ever, all resulting in significant investments in technology and dramatic shifts in the retail landscape, highlighted by both new shopping options on one end and retailer consolidation and closings of websites and stores on the other.
Over the past several years, it's in this environment that we have been transforming our company and have laying the groundwork for future growth. We are excited about the opportunities to do more for and with our customers and to strengthen our business as a world-class omnichannel retailer.
We are making great progress in improving our capabilities every day. We are taking a systematic and logical approach. We are evolving toward providing a more inspirational and personal shopping experience with an expanded offering, which includes a more differentiated product mix and enhanced services and solutions for our customers. This is to earn a reputation with our customers as the expert for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests. Our investments over the past several years have furthered our foundational ability to do so.
The opportunity to do more for and with our customers have never been greater. At the same time, while we make the investments necessary for our transformation, we remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company.
Today, I will provide an update on some of the developments since our last call. We announced the purchase of One Kings Lane on June 14, about 2 weeks into the second quarter. As we've said previously, One Kings Lane will serve as a cornerstone for Bed Bath & Beyond's growing offerings in furniture and home decor. We are only a little more than 3 months into the integration process, so it's still early but things are progressing as expected.
We continue to be impressed by the quality and capabilities of the people of One Kings Lane. And we believe that their merchandising expertise and passion for their customers' homes will further enhance both our ability to satisfy and our credibility with our customers.
Over time, we believe One Kings Lane will provide us an opportunity to improve the overall experiential environment of the services and solutions we offer through design services and studio locations. We believe the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated product to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles.
With respect to differentiated product, Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Tree Shops, andThat! and Of a Kind have always had a substantial assortment of proprietary and private-label products that we continue to improve upon. At Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Harmon Face Values and One Kings Lane, we have also strived to grow a proprietary offering. And as brands are very important to our customers, we have worked to expand our exclusives or first-to-market opportunities for named brand products.
Some examples of these merchandising initiatives include proprietary or exclusive brands such as Wamsutta, Olivia & Oliver and ED by Ellen DeGeneres in Bed Bath & Beyond and Wamsutta BABY and Jonathan Adler Crafted by Fisher Price in buybuy BABY. We also have a growing line of private-label health and beauty care products under the Harmon Face Values label. And just this week, One Kings Lane launched the One Kings Lane Collection, a line of proprietary furniture and lighting.
In addition, we now offer more than 3,000 items that could be customized using text, a monogram or personal photos. This personalization service is available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites, and we will begin to make it available in store through the Beyond store this fall. These items are easy to find under our personalized gifts category and are identified on most shopping pages via an icon or a label that indicates personalization is available.
It's an easy and convenient way to create a unique gift or accent piece for your home. Early customer response has been favorable, and we are continuing to add to the assortment of items that can be personalized. We view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional product differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers.
We also continue to broaden our merchandise categories online. Some recent examples include other home improvement products such as power tools, kitchen and bath fixtures and solar and gas generators. We also expanded our fitness category to include treadmill, stationary bikes and other exercise equipment. In the bath department, we have recently increased our assortment of vanity and lighting. And in our outdoor category, we have added camping gear and equipment.
Differentiation and constant improvements are paramount for us, and this also applies to the services and solutions we provide. We have added more curated experiences to the Bed Bath & Beyond website such as a new category called Designer Picks, which offers an inspirational collection of favorite finds from throughout our websites put together by professional designers.
Within our shops category, you can find a curated assortment of products and solutions organized by themes such as healthy living, smart innovation and fine linens. We have also added several new lifestyle trends to our LOOK LOVE collection.
In our Back to College offering this summer, in addition to our popular in-store events and other services such as Pack & Hold, Shop Now, Ship Later and College Registry services, we have launched Shop With an Expert. This new service enables customers to make an in-store appointment with one of our expert associates to receive personal assistance to get campus-ready. Our associates and our website have valuable information regarding thousands of U.S. colleges and in many cases, the details about select dorms on campus.
We also produced our first Student Life catalog that was mailed in June to a targeted distribution of incoming college freshmen. This 36-page catalog, also available digitally, presented a more inspirational view of the products, services and solutions we offer for this important life stage. We were pleased with the results of this catalog, and we will continue to evolve our targeted marketing efforts in this area.
We have also recently introduced a product expert chat feature on the desktop to select categories on the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites to enhance the online shopping experience and provide customers with an opportunity to interact with one of our expert associates. Currently, we have enabled several categories, including car seats, strollers, monitors, coffee and tea makers and cookware. So for example, if you were browsing through items in the car seat category, you will be prompted to chat live with one of our expert associates for further assistance.
Our customer service representatives engaging in live chat undergo additional training to be able to respond to product-specific questions. We have plans to roll out additional categories going forward. These new offerings give us an opportunity to elevate our customer service, and as a result, create more stickiness with our customers. We know our customers benefit from our expert associates when they shop with us in store. Now we are beginning to translate a differentiated level of service and expertise to the digital experience.
As consumer shopping preferences continue to shift to digital, our investments are driving a better omnichannel experience. We have another round of digital upgrades scheduled over the next couple of months. Some examples for Bed Bath & Beyond include extending chat and in-store appointment schedule into our mobile website; adding the ability for our customers to browse the entire site, including product list and search result pages for a particular item and then further refine their search by what's available in their local store; adding interactive tools to guide our customers through building a registry as well as assisting them in shopping for specific occasions or events; and continuing to improve our search experience through enhanced algorithm and data integration.
Our goal is create a seamless and more personalized shopping experience and to present our customers with more relevant product recommendations and offers -- not just more products but a more relevant experience. This means we need to serve up our offerings in such a way that resonates with our customers. To that end, our marketing capabilities continue to evolve as we further leverage our robust customer database and third-party data to tailor our targeting techniques and enhance our personalization capabilities.
For example, our targeted lifestyle campaigns for college, new mover, baby and wedding enable us to engage with our customers and present timely and relevant information to them about a specific life stage. These campaigns enhance our ability to be viewed as an expert by communicating the products, services and solutions we offer at a relevant time for the customer. As with everything we do, we strive to improve upon the execution of these campaigns in order to better satisfy our customer, expand our services and achieve greater returns.
We have also been refining our existing print advertising program and expanding our specialty print pieces, including catalogs, to drive engagement and enhance product awareness. So far this year, we have published 2 catalogs, Outdoor Living and Student Life. We will soon be releasing a third catalog called Welcome Home, which will showcase the depth and breadth of our product expertise in a more inspirational way than we've ever done before. This 84-page catalog will also be available digitally and includes interactive features to drive further engagements. We're really excited about telling our story and furthering our efforts to be known as the expert for the home.
We have several other marketing initiatives underway this fall, including the rollout of our new cross-concept co-branded credit card and the testing of some additional aspects of a future loyalty program. Our focus on driving a better omnichannel experience also includes advancing the rollout and driving adoption of My Offers, our virtual coupon wallet, to additional Bed Bath & Beyond customers as well as to our buybuy BABY customers.
We're also evolving our physical channels to further integrate our omnichannel capabilities to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing our products, services and solutions as well as our brand to life. We want to highlight the service components that reflect how customers are utilizing our stores as well as provide a more experiential shopping environment through events such as product demonstrations, how-to sessions, food sampling and cooking classes.
Our growing list of services include being able to reserve an item online and pick it up in store, being able to return online orders to a store, to have product shipped to your home from a store or to schedule an appointment for wedding and baby registry and to shop with an expert for college.
In addition, we have introduced new technology in some stores such as a scan-for-more digital tool, which enables a customer to view product images, get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; our interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view a curated assortment of products such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and our digital product advisory tool, which enables customers to find what they're looking for based on responses to questions that will filter the assortment of products that best fit their needs.
We've also talked previously about our newly located Bed Bath & Beyond store at Hyannis, Massachusetts and our new andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia. These are other examples of how we are evolving our physical footprint by testing and bringing differentiated products, services and solutions, including new technologies, to our stores. We continue to learn and transition our stores over time.
We are set to open our newest retail space in Brooklyn in November. Liberty View Industrial Park is the setting for this unique shopping venue, which will include a Bed Bath & Beyond, a buybuy BABY, a Cost Plus World Market and a Harmon store all under one roof. We're excited about this new iteration of the blending of our physical and digital capabilities as we move towards a more experiential shopping environment.
And finally, regarding our newest retail distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas. As Sue mentioned, this new facility opened for inbound freight during the second quarter, and we're targeting to begin shipping to customers in October. Over time, this 800,000-square-foot facility will be able to fill orders for all our concepts and improve our overall delivery capabilities. We continue to assess our supply chain network for opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies as we build world-class fulfillment capabilities.
We remained on course this quarter as we continued to strategically navigate the ever-evolving retail landscape. We remain focused on our customers and what we need to do to earn still more relevancy and to become their destination as the expert for the home and their accompanying life stages and life interests.
It's a transitional time for retail, and many retailers, including us, are experiencing pressure on their operating margins. Despite the fact that we continue to achieve among the highest profit margins in retail, we, too, have experienced downward pressures on our financial results as our transformation continues. During this evolution, we've recognized that we must remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns and improve the long-term profitability of our company while returning value to our shareholders.
We have spoken a lot today about differentiation. Nowhere is it more important than it is with our people. Our historical success and the success we will achieve in the future is due to our dedicated, hard-working, intellectually honest, intellectually curious and never satisfied associates. I'd like to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business.
I'll now turn the call back over to Janet so that we can move forward with our Q&A portion of our call."

There are certain things that indicated good strength. We measure the number of events, the number of attendees at events, the number of high school kids we reached, the number of Pack & Holds we do. From a sales perspective, it's a little bit more difficult for us to measure it because we peg items each year that we call Back to College items, and they don't -- they're not the same necessarily year-to-year. And sometimes, even additional categories might drop off or get added year-over-year. So when we look at the entire quarter, which was relatively flat for us, I think it's fair to say that directionally, to conclude that our Back to College business is probably similar."

But when you talk about noncore categories, Alan, we wouldn't call e-commerce our noncore category. E-commerce is a core category for us. I mean, again, how we reach the customer, how we do more with the customer, how do we satisfy the customer, the digital experience is part of the entire experience, and we have to be great at it. So -- but again, the things that we're doing, we do tend to do things incrementally. When you mentioned -- or when Kate mentioned acquisition, the things that we purchased were always done in a way that we didn't bet the farm on it, that we always try to test into something to make it work, to get better at it and to roll it forward. Similarly, all the things that we're doing with these categories, they're very -- they're not highly -- they're not risky in the sense that if it's furniture or home decor, it's vendor direct for the most part. The categories that we're bringing in and how we show them, we do them in a way that is not to the detriment of our core categories so it doesn't confuse the customer but doesn't busy the site in a way that they can't find what they're looking for. So even as we add categories to our website, it's very important that we improve the website and our marketing and communication and personalization so that the customer can find what they're looking for. We're not just adding a bunch of nonsense to customers or noise to a customer. So everything we do is with an eye towards being better in the eyes of the customer and with an eye towards not betting the house on anything but doing things systematically, deductively, logically, testing them out, proving them out and then rolling them forward."

But we do have the objective to drive differentiated product. I think you probably heard this from us before and everybody will cringe, but differentiated product is life and death to us. So it really is -- so if you look at Bed Bath & Beyond, which does depend a lot on branded products, we work on lead time first to market with product. But we've worked very hard on it, if you look at artisanal or you look at bedding or you look at what we've done with Wamsutta, very important. You look at concepts like Cost Plus World Market, Christmas Trees Shop, andThat!, largely proprietary, significant proprietary projects -- products. If you look at One Kings Lane and that we've now launched this private-label program, if you look across Harmon, where we measure costs and growing our private-label products, in each of the categories that we do business in, it's essential for us to drive differentiated product and to, over time, be known for it. But we don't set a goal because it comes down to what we're able to execute and customer acceptance of it. So in certain categories, things that you have a plug, it's very difficult for us to drive a lot of differentiated product. So I can't answer the question with a percentage or a number, but I can tell you that it's larger in certain businesses, smaller in others and being driven passionately across all."

And for those of you who may have holiday parties to get to tonight, here are some highlights. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.85. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.4%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%.  Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be at the low end of the range we have described in our previous earnings press releases.
During our call today, Sue will review our third quarter financial results and some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, and then Steven will give an update on some operational strategic developments, including the recent acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, which is known as PMall.com and PMall. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue."

I'll start with a review of our third quarter results, which include the activity of PMall for the last few days of the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of ap",1457,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our third quarter results, which include the activity of PMall for the last few days of the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from the third quarter of last year, primarily due to a 1.5% increase in non-comp sales, including One Kings Lane and new stores, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in comp sales.
As we expected, our third quarter comp sales trends were running sequentially better than the second quarter. However, sales softened considerably a week before the presidential election. After the election, comp sales picked back up and, in fact, we experienced relatively strong comp sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. 
Overall for the quarter, the decline in comp sales was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions in our stores, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the third quarter while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
As a reminder, One Kings Lane and PMall are both currently excluded from our comp sales calculations. PMall will be included after the 1-year anniversary of its acquisition. One Kings Lane will be included in comp when the re-platforming of its systems and integration of its support services, both of which are currently in process, have been in place for a period long enough to allow for a meaningful comparison of One Kings Lane's sales over the prior period. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was approximately 37% as compared to approximately 37.8% in the prior year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude: first, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense as a result of more promotional shipping offer activity, including a change in the Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping threshold from $49 last year to $29 this year and for a few days, we offered free shipping on all purchases; and second, an increase in coupon expense resulting from increases in redemption and the average coupon amount. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 13 basis points in the third quarter.
SG&A for the third quarter was approximately 29.8% of net sales as compared to 27.9% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology expenses, included related depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 15 basis points in the third quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 34.5% compared to approximately 35.3% in the prior year period. The third quarter provisions included favorable net after-tax benefits of approximately $6 million this year as compared to $6.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.85 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with approximately $559 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $3.2 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1.4% compared to the end of the prior year period, due in part to the growth in inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers as well as the inventory balances from PMall and One Kings Lane.
Our Lewisville, Texas facility, which opened for inbound freight last quarter, began direct shipments to customers during the third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
Capital expenditures for the 9 months of 2016 were approximately $276 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; the re-platforming of One Kings Lane systems and integration of its support services; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 10 new stores during the quarter, including 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 4 of which were in Canada; 4 buybuy BABY stores, 3 of which were in Canada; and 1 Face Value store. We also closed 8 Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $76 million of stock, representing about 1.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.9 billion at the end of the third quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Now, again, here are some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which incorporate our year-to-date results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and recent business conditions. Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%. 
We continue to model gross margin deleverage for the full year, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We said previously that we expect the gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than in fiscal 2015. Including the extension of Bed Bath & Beyond's $29 free shipping threshold, the slight deleverage from One Kings Lane and a slight leverage from PMall, we are modeling the full year gross margin deleverage to be relatively flat with fiscal 2015.
We continue to model SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the full year, primarily due to payroll and payroll-related items, including wage increases; further investments in technology, including related depreciation and advertising expense. This assumption includes slight deleverage for One Kings Lane and PMall.
As a reminder, last year in the fourth quarter SG&A included certain nonrecurring items which benefited our fiscal 2015 full year net earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. We continue to estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year.
Annual net interest expense is estimated to be approximately $75 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Year-to-date, we have opened a total of 27 stores and have closed 9 stores. Earlier this month, we opened Beyond at Liberty View, a unique shopping experience in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, consisting of 4 of our retail concepts under one roof, including Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Value. In addition, we opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We remain on track with our fiscal 2016 model to open approximately 30 stores, most of which are in new markets for our various concepts, and close approximately 15.
Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. We expect to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization and anticipate the completion of this program to occur sometime in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflect our 9-month results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and our recent business trends, we are modeling our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be at the low end of this historical range.
We are currently in the process of completing our financial planning assumptions for fiscal 2017, which as a reminder, is a 53-week year. We will provide further information related our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter conference call, which is planned for April 5, 2017.
With that, I will turn the call over to Steven."

Within this environment, we've been workin",1901,"Thank you, Sue. Our third quarter results were in line with what we experienced during the first half of the year. This reflects the increasing proportion of sales moving online through various digital platforms. Within this environment, we've been working continuously to evolve our company and expand the breadth of the differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. By providing real answers to our customer needs at the right time and at the right value, we can further strengthen our credibility as the experts for the home and for our customers' accompanying life stages and life interests. 
Today, I will provide an update on some of the key developments in our business over the past several months and the progress we are making in transforming our company to be increasingly relevant and to improve our competitive position in this ever-changing retail environment.
As we reported on November 23, we made an all-cash acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, an industry-leading online retailer of personalized products. The addition of PMall expands our existing personalization and customization capabilities and further enhances our offering of differentiated products, services and solutions to our customers. As we have said previously, we view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers. The market for personalized products is highly fragmented and estimated to be in excess of $15 billion, with a high single-digit annualized growth rate. Historically, demand has been largely driven by gifting occasions, peaking during the winter holiday season.
Over the past 18 years, PMall has developed into a highly successful and innovative company within the personalization category. A key competitive advantage is their fully integrated proprietary technology platform that drives quality, speed and efficiency. PMall's production facilities are capable of automating 14 different innovative personalization processes on a variety of services. These processes include sublimation, embroidery, digital printing, engraving and sandblasting.
PMall already has a large assortment with the opportunity to grow. The assortment includes personalized products to commemorate all of life's events and special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, holidays and the welcoming of a child. Their streamlined production processes enable a 1-day average turnaround time. And importantly, they also share our passion for and commitment to excellent customer service. PMall will remain a distinct brand under the Bed Bath & Beyond umbrella, and we will support them as they continue to improve the customer experience by enhancing their product mix, upgrading their e-commerce website and driving optimization of their marketing initiatives.
As we described in our November 23 press release, we expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share. Going forward, there are synergies that should result in future cost savings and efficiencies in areas including shipping and marketing.
While PMall remains a distinct brand, at the same time, we already have nearly 5,000 items available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites and in stores through the Beyond store that can be personalized. We believe there is an extensive opportunity to grow this assortment. We're excited to partner with PMall and leverage their advanced personalization and production capabilities to further advance our personalization capabilities across all other concepts.
In addition to growing our assortment of personalized products, we have also continued to build out our product and service offerings within other categories, notably furniture and home decor. As we have previously said, the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment that includes unique and differentiated product that will engage with our customers in a meaningful way by providing inspiration, solutions and services across various lifestyles.
Also, we recently introduced a new home decor feature, a drapery design gallery, to be available in select stores and online at bedbathandbeyond.com. Customers can customize draperies for their home by choosing from 250 fabrics, 3 header styles and 4 lanes. In just a few simple steps, customers can select the look and style of the window treatment that best fits their home decor.
To showcase our expanded offering, including within the home furnishing and decor categories and our expertise for the home, we released our first-ever Welcome Home catalog in early October, containing 84 pages of product inspiration for the entire home. In some respects, we're at the beginning stages of building awareness of our wide-ranging assortment of differentiated products, services and solutions for the home and the accompanying life stages and life interests through a more inspirational imagery and content. Catalogs of this type are one way to introduce customers to these expanded offerings and our broad-based expertise.
While the results of the catalog will include the benefits of longer-term brand building, we are pleased with the initial reception of the book and the positive feedback from customers. Based on the initial results, we plan to release another home catalog this spring to further reinforce our position as the expert for the home.
Also, to further these efforts, we are bringing a significant portion of our creative and photography work in-house and hiring a team of about 70 people who will work together alongside existing One Kings Lane creative and photography staff and our new creative and photo studios in Manhattan. We believe bringing more of these capabilities in-house will allow us to have greater control over our ability to produce more inspirational content. In addition, we expect this effort to help increase our digital marketing assets and drive other operational efficiencies for the business.
During the third quarter, other marketing initiatives included the launch of a beta test for our new annual membership program called BEYOND+. For an annual fee of $29, which is being used in our test, members received 20% off their purchases as well as free standard shipping on every order for an entire year. The initial test includes a small cross-section of our customer base, and we are currently monitoring the purchasing behavior of our members over time. We will formulate the next steps to this program based on the key learnings from the beta test, which to date remain encouraging.
In addition to elevating the customer experience through our product and marketing initiatives, we have also advanced our initiatives to elevate the experience within our stores. As Sue mentioned, we have opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We were excited to design this new store to reflect the lifestyle of the area and to feature merchandise inspired by its coastal location. The grand opening occurred last week, and we look forward to learning from our customers' response to our store. As you may recall, our first reformatted andThat! store opened this past April in Kennesaw, Georgia, and it continues to perform well.
A couple of weeks ago we opened the doors of our new shopping venue, Beyond at Liberty View, located in the Sunset Park community within Brooklyn. With approximately 120,000 square feet, this is a unique shopping destination that includes a Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values, all under one roof. For about 2 years now, we have worked to help transform this historic industrial complex constructed in the early 1900s into a vibrant retail space that showcases the products, services and solutions we have to offer today.
We believe the learnings generated from this initial Beyond experience will be beneficial to us in many ways. First, many of the aspects of what we've done here, including our enhanced assortment and services, can be rolled forward to other store locations. Second, we will iterate the entire experience in other settings where appropriate. This experience gives us tremendous clay to work with and continue to do more for and with our customers. We are very excited to be open in Brooklyn and service the local community and have plan to a grand opening to take place during the Martin Luther King holiday weekend in January.
In addition to bringing Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values together in one location and under one roof, there are many features and services special to the Beyond venue. They include an experiential environment where customers and their families can participate in product demonstrations, how-to sessions, cooking classes and other live events in our events space called '71 at Beyond, named after the year Bed Bath & Beyond was founded; a born in Brooklyn feature consisting of Brooklyn-based designers and their products; a seamless and more personalized shopping experience utilizing our latest digital tools to assist customers in finding the right merchandise for their homes and lifestyles, such as scan-for-more, which enable the customer to view product images and get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view an expanded assortment of product, such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and a digital product adviser, which enables customers to find what they are looking for based on responses to questions that filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs.
Also, a dedicated area called the Beyond Room for customers to work with our in-store expert for currency [ph] services, such as our personal shopping, registry and soon-to-come decorating services; a curated collection called Best of New, which will feature the best new items from Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values. This collection will be located in the Beyond Room; a Blow In Blow Out [ph] bar where customers can make appointments with professional stylists to wash, blow and style their hair; additional special services such as home delivery, assembly and installation services; a unique food hall-style dining experience called the Bay Market Kitchen, which serves casual American cuisine as well as local craft beers and select lines. In addition to the restaurant, there are other food stations featuring local fare that change vendors on a regular basis and coffee bars featuring local favorites, such as Brooklyn-based Toby's Estate Coffee.
The Sunset Park community is a thriving and dynamic part of Brooklyn, and we're happy to be part of this growing and diverse neighborhood. We believe that this venue, including the revised format of our stores along with the enhanced services we offer, will become a retail destination for customers to have a fun and productive shopping experience. We hope many of you will be able to visit Beyond at Liberty View and give us your feedback.
In summary, it continues to be a transitional time for retail, and new advances in technology are creating opportunities for our customers to shop in a more seamless environment and for us to do more for and with our customers and connect with them in a more personalized manner. As our business transforms, we're navigating the competitive landscape and adapting as customer preferences and purchasing behavior evolve. We believe that we are making the right investments for our company's long-term success and are well positioned to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.
In closing, I would like to thank our dedicated associates, including our new team numbers from PMall, for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. I wish you all a healthy and happy holiday season and new year.

And the truth is that I think anybody who tells you what they'll be making 3 or 4 years out is just based upon a set of assumptions. And as everybody learns is that the further out you go, the more difficult it is to predict what it's going to be. A lot of these investments we've made have really been foundational for us. They've put us in a position to grow and that's hopefully what will happen. But we can't --  we're not able to say. We don't know -- we know for sure if we didn't make these investments, we'd be one of those companies that you won't be talking to any more. So we're fortunate that we still make some of the best returns in retail. We know that it's not a sexy place to be today at retail. We know what our competitors are doing from a -- or not doing. So these investments are really intended to position us to grow our earnings. We won't be satisfied until we're growing our earnings again. I wish I could tell you exactly the day that will be but it's just not the case. We're not going to be telling something that's 3 or 4 years out. Obviously, if things that we're working on like the growth of our digital business, which has been so strong, the larger the component of our overall business, our digital business becomes and we continue to grow it, that will be beneficial to us. If we're able to execute against a differentiated product, the services, solutions that we offer, that will help us to achieve greater profitability of the differentiated product, the margin structure is different. So all these things are component pieces of getting better and producing the better earnings, but it's the question that -- the right question to ask it's the question that we work towards accomplishing, but they're just simply, I can't tell you when that is internal variables that we execute against that we think we're doing very well, and it's external things that are happening in the marketplace. Still the lion's share of our business is done in bricks and mortar. And the foot traffic that we're seeing, the reduction in foot traffic I think being seen across retail as well as we have a significant component in bricks and mortar like that, that is a bit of a headwind for us."

When we talk about the decorating services or being able to -- have scheduled appointments to go create a registry. When we talk about the things that create the additional stickiness with the customer, the more experiential things that will increase foot traffic relative to where it is today, those are all critical elements of being different but making sure the customer understands that we're different and we're delivering on the message that we're different. So it can't be done in one way. Again, it goes back to the inspirational content we're showing. All the things we're doing to make the customer feel that we're the expert for the home.

The other thing that we did talk about and that we acknowledged is that we have been going to great lengths to introduce our customers to these other categories today. It's critical that we be great in our core categories. It's critical to us, I think, that we be great and really be really close ancillary categories. At that point, we would make sense to start introducing them to everything else that we sell. At that point, we would know about our customer. We'll know more about their life stage, their life interests, what they've shopped for, what they've searched for, where they've searched on other sites, where they've come from, where they've gone to when they left our site to be able to offer them the other product that we sell. But for today, we really haven't gone to really any length to really introduce the customer to all the other things we're adding. It will be there and at the point in time that we're prepared to do that, the assortment will be rich. There's so many things about it and a lot of it is vendor direct. So a lot of it we have to get relationships with these vendors to have confidence in their capabilities to satisfy the customer, to deliver to the customer. If you look at certain categories, when you look at the search and how you search for it on our site, you will be disappointed. You will look at things and say, ""My God, that's not best-in-class"" in some of these categories. So to be running to introduce to customers to certain categories today when we don't do it well, when we really have to double down on our core categories to make the customer understand how we're different, why we're different, why we're great at them, it's just hasn't been the appropriate time. When you take a look at the 84-page home catalog that we did, that's perhaps a first step into introducing to the customer that all of the -- a number of other things that we sell are categories that we sell, so that's what will be view the first time a content piece has gone out even introduced it to them in a large scale, and that book was a very limited book.

But it's really haven't something that I think if you ask 9 out of 10 customers, maybe I shouldn't be giving numbers, for most customers, a lot of the categories that we added we carry, they'd be surprised. I know that Gene tells me stories all the time about family members I don't know. I count on Gene to make these are good communication vehicle for us. So it's a big opportunity for us of that we're not in a rush to be off with something. a so we will get there but the for the time being, we're adding to our website, we're organizing in the search, providing the vendors to make sure they can deliver on our promise of service for our customers and at the appropriate time, we'll introduce the customer to the expanded offering."

We just looked at it as that it really has been a cross-section of stores. It really has more to do with coming to the end of a term, not being able to negotiate a favorable occupancy, looking out over a future time of the lease with our expectations of what's happening with foot traffic. Also we look at what business to be picked up in the market without cannibalization. We looked at the other impacts of closing the store. Getting to your last part of the question, the third part of the question, the stores are critical. The stores not only for their 4-wall profitability but the stores are also today, for the appointment scheduling, to start a registry, to buy online and pick up in the store, to be able to buy an expanded assortment or return something in a store. Those things are critical the store any market drives online digital business. It drives it, the visibility of the store. So all those reasons why the stores are important. And -- no, for the second part of the question, I guess, which is the run rate question is that there really isn't a run rate. I mean, there are independent decisions and being made based upon what's coming available to renegotiate and the landlord's flexibility and impact of keeping it open or closed based upon the new economics. So if you told me that every landlord was going to cut their occupancy in half, I will tell you that run rate would will be one thing. If you told us that everybody was going to try to have one piece of the flavor of the day, then there would be something else. But I don't -- it's not going to be a run rate.

When you look at the large percentage of our business that we rely on in-store today, that when we look at all our competitors basically and you see that they're having similar issues with foot traffic, that would seem to be. And when we look at our digital business and how strong it is, as we look at -- as we -- components of our business where we expect it to be relatively strong, it keeps coming back to foot traffic in the stores. I guess, it was the case that we expected this. That's what we expected this over time, that, of course, we keep driving to grow our digital business, the better off we will be in that sense in terms of our top line. And we -- as far as this quarter itself that we just reported on, we were seeing that sequential improvement. built in the first and second quarter right up until that week before the election, and then after the election, we started to improve again but we had a couple of very bad weeks. And we had a strong Black Friday through that Monday, and we're anticipating a positive comp for the fourth quarter. So -- but given that all -- in totality, it would all be better with stronger foot traffic. 
And just to be clear about it because that's a great question, that this is our model. And we always want it to be our model, but it's our model. But to the extent that we underperform our model and it doesn't come in as planned, then it does jeopardize the entire model. So to the extent that we were -- that will be stronger in terms of the range at the beginning of the year and now we're less strong within that range, if things were worse, we will be out of the range. So all those things are the reality of building the model. But for now, the model would show and the business would indicate from where we are today and where we predict that we're going as that the trend line is a good one for us. But we'll have to see."

All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today. Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties.

And for those of you who may have holiday parties to get to tonight, here are some highlights. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.85. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.4%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%.  Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be at the low end of the range we have described in our previous earnings press releases.
During our call today, Sue will review our third quarter financial results and some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, and then Steven will give an update on some operational strategic developments, including the recent acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, which is known as PMall.com and PMall. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue."
321778,406473387,1104749,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our third quarter results, which include the activity of PMall for the last few days of the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of ap",1457,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our third quarter results, which include the activity of PMall for the last few days of the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from the third quarter of last year, primarily due to a 1.5% increase in non-comp sales, including One Kings Lane and new stores, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in comp sales.
As we expected, our third quarter comp sales trends were running sequentially better than the second quarter. However, sales softened considerably a week before the presidential election. After the election, comp sales picked back up and, in fact, we experienced relatively strong comp sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. 
Overall for the quarter, the decline in comp sales was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions in our stores, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the third quarter while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
As a reminder, One Kings Lane and PMall are both currently excluded from our comp sales calculations. PMall will be included after the 1-year anniversary of its acquisition. One Kings Lane will be included in comp when the re-platforming of its systems and integration of its support services, both of which are currently in process, have been in place for a period long enough to allow for a meaningful comparison of One Kings Lane's sales over the prior period. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was approximately 37% as compared to approximately 37.8% in the prior year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude: first, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense as a result of more promotional shipping offer activity, including a change in the Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping threshold from $49 last year to $29 this year and for a few days, we offered free shipping on all purchases; and second, an increase in coupon expense resulting from increases in redemption and the average coupon amount. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 13 basis points in the third quarter.
SG&A for the third quarter was approximately 29.8% of net sales as compared to 27.9% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology expenses, included related depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 15 basis points in the third quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 34.5% compared to approximately 35.3% in the prior year period. The third quarter provisions included favorable net after-tax benefits of approximately $6 million this year as compared to $6.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.85 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with approximately $559 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $3.2 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1.4% compared to the end of the prior year period, due in part to the growth in inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers as well as the inventory balances from PMall and One Kings Lane.
Our Lewisville, Texas facility, which opened for inbound freight last quarter, began direct shipments to customers during the third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
Capital expenditures for the 9 months of 2016 were approximately $276 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; the re-platforming of One Kings Lane systems and integration of its support services; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 10 new stores during the quarter, including 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 4 of which were in Canada; 4 buybuy BABY stores, 3 of which were in Canada; and 1 Face Value store. We also closed 8 Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $76 million of stock, representing about 1.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.9 billion at the end of the third quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Now, again, here are some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which incorporate our year-to-date results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and recent business conditions. Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%. 
We continue to model gross margin deleverage for the full year, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We said previously that we expect the gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than in fiscal 2015. Including the extension of Bed Bath & Beyond's $29 free shipping threshold, the slight deleverage from One Kings Lane and a slight leverage from PMall, we are modeling the full year gross margin deleverage to be relatively flat with fiscal 2015.
We continue to model SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the full year, primarily due to payroll and payroll-related items, including wage increases; further investments in technology, including related depreciation and advertising expense. This assumption includes slight deleverage for One Kings Lane and PMall.
As a reminder, last year in the fourth quarter SG&A included certain nonrecurring items which benefited our fiscal 2015 full year net earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. We continue to estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year.
Annual net interest expense is estimated to be approximately $75 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Year-to-date, we have opened a total of 27 stores and have closed 9 stores. Earlier this month, we opened Beyond at Liberty View, a unique shopping experience in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, consisting of 4 of our retail concepts under one roof, including Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Value. In addition, we opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We remain on track with our fiscal 2016 model to open approximately 30 stores, most of which are in new markets for our various concepts, and close approximately 15.
Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. We expect to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization and anticipate the completion of this program to occur sometime in fiscal 2020. Of course, the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflect our 9-month results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and our recent business trends, we are modeling our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be at the low end of this historical range.
We are currently in the process of completing our financial planning assumptions for fiscal 2017, which as a reminder, is a 53-week year. We will provide further information related our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter conference call, which is planned for April 5, 2017.
With that, I will turn the call over to Steven."

This reflects the increasing proportion of sales moving online through various digital platforms. Within this environment, we've been working continuously to evolve our company and expand the breadth of the differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. By providing real answers to our customer needs at the right time and at the right value, we can further strengthen our credibility as the experts for the home and for our customers' accompanying life stages and life interests. 
Today, I will provide an update on some of the key developments in our business over the past several months and the progress we are making in transforming our company to be increasingly relevant and to improve our competitive position in this ever-changing retail environment.
As we reported on November 23, we made an all-cash acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, an industry-leading online retailer of personalized products. The addition of PMall expands our existing personalization and customization capabilities and further enhances our offering of differentiated products, services and solutions to our customers. As we have said previously, we view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers. The market for personalized products is highly fragmented and estimated to be in excess of $15 billion, with a high single-digit annualized growth rate. Historically, demand has been largely driven by gifting occasions, peaking during the winter holiday season.
Over the past 18 years, PMall has developed into a highly successful and innovative company within the personalization category. A key competitive advantage is their fully integrated proprietary technology platform that drives quality, speed and efficiency. PMall's production facilities are capable of automating 14 different innovative personalization processes on a variety of services. These processes include sublimation, embroidery, digital printing, engraving and sandblasting.
PMall already has a large assortment with the opportunity to grow. The assortment includes personalized products to commemorate all of life's events and special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, holidays and the welcoming of a child. Their streamlined production processes enable a 1-day average turnaround time. And importantly, they also share our passion for and commitment to excellent customer service. PMall will remain a distinct brand under the Bed Bath & Beyond umbrella, and we will support them as they continue to improve the customer experience by enhancing their product mix, upgrading their e-commerce website and driving optimization of their marketing initiatives.
As we described in our November 23 press release, we expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share. Going forward, there are synergies that should result in future cost savings and efficiencies in areas including shipping and marketing.
While PMall remains a distinct brand, at the same time, we already have nearly 5,000 items available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites and in-store through the Beyond store that can be personalized. We believe there is an extensive opportunity to grow this assortment. We're excited to partner with PMall and leverage their advanced personalization and production capabilities to further advance our personalization capabilities across all other concepts.
In addition to growing our assortment of personalized products, we've also continued to build out our product and service offerings within other categories, notably furniture and home decor. As we have previously said, the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment that includes unique and differentiated product that will engage with our customers in a meaningful way by providing inspiration, solutions and services across various lifestyles.
Also, we recently introduced a new home decor feature, a drapery design gallery, to be available in select stores and online at bedbathandbeyond.com. Customers can customize draperies for their home by choosing from 250 fabrics, 3 header styles and 4 lanes. In just a few simple steps, customers can select the look and style of the window treatment that best fits their home decor.
To showcase our expanded offering, including within the home furnishing and decor categories and our expertise for the home, we released our first-ever Welcome Home catalog in early October, containing 84 pages of product inspiration for the entire home. In some respects, we're at the beginning stages of building awareness of our wide-ranging assortment of differentiated products, services and solutions for the home and the accompanying life stages and life interests through a more inspirational imagery and content. Catalogs of this type are one way to introduce customers to these expanded offerings and our broad-based expertise.
While the results of the catalog will include the benefits of longer-term brand building, we are pleased with the initial reception of the book and the positive feedback from customers. Based on the initial results, we plan to release another home catalog this spring to further reinforce our position as the expert for the home.
Also, to further these efforts, we are bringing a significant portion of our creative and photography work in-house and hiring a team of about 70 people who will work together alongside existing One Kings Lane creative and photography staff and our new creative and photo studios in Manhattan. We believe bringing more of these capabilities in-house will allow us to have greater control over our ability to produce more inspirational content. In addition, we expect this effort to help increase our digital marketing assets and drive other operational efficiencies for the business.
During the third quarter, other marketing initiatives included the launch of a beta test for our new annual membership program called BEYOND+. For an annual fee of $29, which is being used in our test, members received 20% off their purchases as well as free standard shipping on every order for an entire year. The initial test includes a small cross-section of our customer base, and we are currently monitoring the purchasing behavior of our members over time. We will formulate the next steps to this program based on the key learnings from the beta test, which to date remain encouraging.
In addition to elevating the customer experience through our product and marketing initiatives, we have also advanced our initiatives to elevate the experience within our stores. As Sue mentioned, we have opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We were excited to design this new store to reflect the lifestyle of the area and to feature merchandise inspired by its coastal location. The grand opening occurred last week, and we look forward to learning from our customers' response to our store. As you may recall, our first reformatted andThat! store opened this past April in Kennesaw, Georgia, and it continues to perform well.
A couple of weeks ago we opened the doors of our new shopping venue, Beyond at Liberty View, located in the Sunset Park community within Brooklyn. With approximately 120,000 square feet, this is a unique shopping destination that includes a Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values, all under one roof. For about 2 years now, we have worked to help transform this historic industrial complex constructed in the early 1900s into a vibrant retail space that showcases the products, services and solutions we have to offer today.
We believe the learnings generated from this initial Beyond experience will be beneficial to us in many ways. First, many of the aspects of what we've done here, including our enhanced assortment and services, can be rolled forward to other store locations. Second, we will iterate the entire experience in other settings where appropriate. This experience gives us tremendous clay to work with and continue to do more for and with our customers. We are very excited to be open in Brooklyn and service the local community and have plan to a grand opening to take place during the Martin Luther King holiday weekend in January.
In addition to bringing Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values together in one location and under one roof, there are many features and services special to the Beyond venue.

We're trying to do the things that makes sense for the company. So again, if you -- and we said it over and over again, but our focus is on the customer and how do we do more with the customer. And the ability to offer these services, the categories of product, the solutions that we can offer and how to leverage that is the goal. We talk to customers, trying to understand their interest, their life stage through analytics and target marketing to service them with this. So whether we're adding furniture and home decor, whether we're adding services or if we're adding differentiated product and personalized products, all these things are in keeping with what we're doing with our objective and our stated objective to do more with the customer. And so whether we add people by way of hiring people or we buy a small company or how we move forward, it's just the vehicle in a lot of ways. So all these things are giving us a better ability to deliver for the customer. So it's not that we're trying to get bigger, or there's nothing about ego here. It's all about being better. And so it's the same thing with disgorging. We'll close stores when they make sense to close them. We'll move things out of a portfolio if it makes sense to do that. If we're providing certain types of services that don't make sense or that we can't make sense of, we'll stop doing it. Well, of course, we'll try to do it correctly, and then we would stop doing it. So it's not a matter -- we don't look at it as a size component of getting bigger or smaller. It's really just being better."

And as everybody learns is that the further out you go, the more difficult it is to predict what it's going to be. A lot of these investments we've made have really been foundational for us. They put us in a position to grow, and that's hopefully what will happen. But we can't --  we're not able to say. We don't know. We know for sure if we didn't make these investments, we'd be one of those companies that you won't be talking to any more. So we're fortunate that we still make some of the best returns in retail. We know that it's not a sexy place to be today, retail. We know what our competitors are doing from a P&L -- or not doing. So these investments are really intended to position us to grow our earnings. We won't be satisfied until we're growing our earnings again. I wish I could tell you exactly the day that would be, but it's just -- it's not the case. We're not going to be telling you something that's 3 or 4 years out. Obviously, if things that we're working on, like the growth of our digital business, which has been so strong, the larger the component of our overall business our digital business becomes and we continue to grow it, that will be beneficial to us. If we're able to execute against a differentiated product, the services and solutions that we offer, that will help us to achieve greater profitability of the differentiated product. The margin structure is different. So all these things are component pieces of getting better and producing the better earnings. But it's the question that -- the right question to ask, it's the question that we work towards accomplishing, but they're just simply -- I can't tell you when that is. There's internal variables that we execute against that we think we're doing fairly well, and there's external things that are happening in the marketplace. Still the lion's share of our business is done in bricks and mortar. And the foot traffic that we're seeing, the reduction in foot traffic, I think, being seen across all retail, and as long as we have a significant component in bricks and mortar like that, that is a bit of a headwind for us."

At the same time, when you talk about the services, whether we have the largest bridal registry, whether we are going to have the largest baby registry, the largest new mover business, all these things are important to deliver on those related services. When we talk about the decorating services or being able to -- they have scheduled appointments to go and to create a registry, when we talk about the things that create the additional stickiness with the customer, the more experiential things that will increase foot traffic relative to where it is today, those are all critical elements of being different, but making sure the customer understands that we're different and we're delivering on the message that we're different. So it can't be done in one way and again, it goes back to the inspirational content we're showing, all the things we're doing to make the customer feel that we're the expert for the home. It's just not one road that we could travel. Each of these things are important to us. I understand that you were in a Brooklyn location, I think, today. So I mean, you'll see there some of the things that we're delivering to the customer, and not everything is even open yet. But again, those are the things that we're trying to explain to the customer. So if you could bring together the differentiated product, you can bring together the local product, if you could bring together different services that they -- that we offer and the expertise that we provide, all these things have to be -- you have to be great at them, the customer has to understand that you have them and you have to deliver on them. So I wouldn't say one is more important than the other. They're all critical to us."

However, when it comes to being at the right price or similar or the same merchandise, we've taken the position and we maintain that we have to be at that price so that if other people are -- with price transparency more so than ever, that you have to be at the right price and certain that that's the right price before the coupon. We can't have the coupon be a -- think that that's in any way an answer for us. It might be for some customers, it might be for some point in time, but we have to be at the right price without the use of the coupon. So that's the way we thought.

I don't want to keep beating this drum, but it is the truth is that, first of all, we have to be thought of by the customers as their first choice. So when we talk about all those life stages and life interests, truly, when I talked about baby and bridal and new mover and back to college and decorating, we have to be the first choice. We have to be the first choice for enthusiasts. We can't have to be a competitor when it comes to cookware or bakeware or when it comes to closet and storage. We have to be the first choice for these things. So it is a certain point that we have that differentiated product, that we really do provide services and solutions that are better for the customer and they recognize that and that we do it through inspirational marketing and that we do it through better content. I was just looking before, it's something that we do versus one of our competitors in the cookware arena and how we show it online and how we talk about it and acknowledge that. And frankly, we're doing well. And so -- but these are the things that a customer has to see, so it's -- that step's critical to us because again, it can't be about the coupon. We have to be at the right price. There's all different things that are evolving, that there's product that's been -- that the vendors maintain pricing, everybody's at the same pricing, we've never been able to take a coupon on. That's not a new model. That's something that we understand. There's product that to a customer you say it's different but it might -- they might not understand how it's different, so we're not doing a good enough job of communicating, so we can't price it differently perhaps. But when it's the same product, that the customers believe it's the same product, we have to be at that price pre-coupon. We think that to be at the wrong price going forward, the customer won't find you. When they go online, we're not going to be relevant. We're not going to show up in algorithms. We're not going to be in the right place if our pricing is wrong. New customers who come online don't understand even though we have a coupon that we -- what the coupon is or what it means. So for us to be reliant on a coupon and to be at the wrong price, it's just the wrong thought process. So when you said that we used to think that way, I don't know -- if somebody in your organization told you that, it's not the organizational think.

So -- but for the same product, all those places are very relevant. So to the extent they were at the wrong price, you brought the wrong price. So -- and then when you ask me what's the right price -- because look, that's something that literally is an interesting question. We have all these analysts now and they run all these algorithms and they'll come back with the conclusion of how you move the shopper. If you're within a certain percent or a certain cents or at certain price points or certain times of the year and certain categories, you have to be at exactly the same price. So all those things are things that are not one answer across the board in some cases. You have to be at the same price and maybe in some instances, if you were $0.10 higher or 2% higher, it might not be important if they're bundled with other things that only we carry perhaps. In some cases that we're competing with somebody who's really a category killer, who's really known, then maybe we have to be below their price to be relevant.

That's a general all because -- and most things in life aren't all, but it happens to be because they all started small. But, of course, they're all growing. The other thing that we did talk about and that we acknowledged is that we have been gone to great lengths to introduce our customers to these other categories today. It's critical that we be great in our core categories. It's critical to us, I think, that we be great and really be really close ancillary categories. At that point, we would make sense to start introducing them to everything else that we sell. At that point, we would know about our customer. We'll know more about their life stage, their life interests, what they've shopped for, what they've searched for, where they've searched on other sites, where they've come from, where they've gone to when they left our site to be able to offer them the other product that we sell. But for today, we really haven't gone really any length to really introduce the customer to all the other things we're adding. It will be there and at a point in time that we're prepared to do that, the assortment will be rich. There's so many things about it. A lot of it is vendor direct. So a lot of it we have to get relationships with these vendors to have confidence in their capabilities to satisfy the customer, to deliver to the customer. If you look at certain categories, when you look at the search and how you search for it on our site, you will be disappointed. You would look at things and say, ""My god, that's not best-in-class,"" in some of these categories. So to be running to introduce the customer to certain categories today when we don't do it well, when we really have to double down on our core categories to make the customer understand how we're different, why we're different, why we're great at them, it's just -- it hasn't been the appropriate time. When you take a look at the 84-page home catalog that we did, that's perhaps a first step into introducing to the customer that all of the -- a number of other things that we sell or categories that we sell. So that's what it may be from the first time a content piece has gone out, even introduce it to them in a large scale and that book was a very limited book. In the spring, we'll have the opportunity to expand upon that. But it's really hasn't something that -- and I think if you were to ask 9 out of 10 customers, maybe I shouldn't be giving numbers, for most customers, a lot of the categories we added that we carry, they'd be surprised. I know that, Gene tells me stories all the time, it's about family members who don't know. I count on Gene to make sure these are good communication vehicles for us. So it's a big opportunity for us, but we're not in a rush to be off with something. We're -- we still -- we will get there. But for the time being, we're adding to our website. We're organizing it so it can be searched. We're learning the vendors to make sure that they can deliver on our promise of service for our customers and at the appropriate time, we'll introduce the customer to the expanded offering."

We just look at it as that it really has been a cross-section of stores. It really has more to do with coming to the end of a term, not being able to negotiate a favorable occupancy, looking out over a future time of the lease with our expectations of what's happening with foot traffic. Also, we look at what business do we pick up in the market if we -- without cannibalization. We look at the other impacts of closing a store because getting to your last part of the question, the third part of the question, the stores are critical. The stores, not only for their 4-wall profitability, but the stores are also today for the appointment scheduling, to start a registry, to buy online and pick up in the store, to be able to buy expanded assortment and return something in a store, those things are critical. The store in a market drives online digital business. It drives it, the visibility of the store. So all those reasons why the stores are important. And the middle -- the second part of the question, I guess, which is the run rate question is that there really isn't a run rate. I mean, these are independent decisions being made based upon what's coming available to renegotiate and the landlord's flexibility and the impact of keeping it open or close based upon the new economics. So if you told me that every landlord was going to cut their occupancy in half, I would tell you that run rate would be one thing. If you told us that everybody was going to try to have one piece of the flavor of the day, then there would be something else. But I don't -- it's not fair to say a run rate. We really are making independent decisions in each case trying to make the right decision."

I guess, it was the case that we expected this, that we've expected this over time that the course there is though we could drive and grow our digital business, the better off we will be in that sense in terms of our top line. And we -- and as far as this quarter itself that we just reported on, we were seeing that sequential improvement from both our first and second quarter right up until that week before the election. And then after the election, we started to improve again, but we had a couple very bad weeks. And we had a strong Black Friday through that Monday, and we're anticipating a positive comp for the fourth quarter. So -- but given that all -- in totality, it would all be better with stronger foot traffic. And just to be clear about it because Seth asked a great question, that this is our model. And we always want to beat our model, but it's our model. But to the extent that we underperform our model and it doesn't come in as planned, then it does jeopardize the entire model. So to the extent that we were -- thought that we'll be stronger in terms of the range at the beginning of the year and now we're less strong within that range, if things were worse, then we would be out of the range. So all those things are the reality of building the model. But for now, the model would show and the business would indicate from where we are today and where we predict that we're going is that the trend line is a good one for us. But we'll have to see."

And for those of you who may have holiday parties to get to tonight, here are some highlights. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.85. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior-year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.4%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range. 
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%. Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be at the low end of the range we have described in our previous earnings press releases.
During our call today, Sue will review our third quarter financial results and some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, and then Steven will give an update on some operational strategic developments, including the recent acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, which is known as PMall.com and PMall. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue."
321778,406473387,1104755,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our third quarter results, which include the activity of PMall for the last few days of the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of ap",1456,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our third quarter results, which include the activity of PMall for the last few days of the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from the third quarter of last year, primarily due to a 1.5% increase in non-comp sales, including One Kings Lane and new stores, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in comp sales.
As we expected, our third quarter comp sales trends were running sequentially better than the second quarter. However, sales softened considerably a week before the presidential election. After the election, comp sales picked back up and, in fact, we experienced relatively strong comp sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. 
Overall for the quarter, the decline in comp sales was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions in our stores, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the third quarter, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
As a reminder, One Kings Lane and PMall are both currently excluded from our comp sales calculations. PMall will be included after the 1-year anniversary of its acquisition. One Kings Lane will be included in comp when the re-platforming of its systems and integration of its support services, both of which are currently in process, have been in place for a period long enough to allow for a meaningful comparison of One Kings Lane's sales over the prior period. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was approximately 37% as compared to approximately 37.8% in the prior-year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude: first, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense as a result of more promotional shipping offer activity, including a change in the Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping threshold from $49 last year to $29 this year and for a few days, we offered free shipping on all purchases; and second, an increase in coupon expense resulting from increases in redemption and the average coupon amount. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 13 basis points in the third quarter.
SG&A for the third quarter was approximately 29.8% of net sales as compared to 27.9% of net sales in the prior-year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology expenses, included related depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 15 basis points in the third quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 34.5% compared to approximately 35.3% in the prior-year period. The third quarter provisions included favorable net after-tax benefits of approximately $6 million this year as compared to $6.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.85 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with approximately $559 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $3.2 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1.4% compared to the end of the prior-year period, due in part to the growth in inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers as well as the inventory balances from PMall and One Kings Lane.
Our Lewisville, Texas facility, which opened for inbound freight last quarter, began direct shipments to customers during the third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
Capital expenditures for the 9 months of 2016 were approximately $276 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; the re-platforming of One Kings Lane systems and integration of its support services; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 10 new stores during the quarter, including 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 4 of which were in Canada; 4 buybuy BABY stores, 3 of which were in Canada; and 1 Face Value store. We also closed 8 Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $76 million of stock, representing about 1.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.9 billion at the end of the third quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Now, again, here are some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which incorporate our year-to-date results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and recent business conditions. Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%. 
We continue to model gross margin deleverage for the full year, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We said previously that we expect the gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than in fiscal 2015. Including the extension of Bed Bath & Beyond's $29 free shipping threshold, the slight deleverage from One Kings Lane and a slight leverage from PMall, we are modeling the full year gross margin deleverage to be relatively flat with fiscal 2015.
We continue to model SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the full year, primarily due to: payroll and payroll-related items, including wage increases; further investments in technology, including related depreciation; and advertising expense. This assumption includes slight deleverage for One Kings Lane and PMall.
As a reminder, last year in the fourth quarter, SG&A included certain nonrecurring items which benefited our fiscal 2015 full year net earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. We continue to estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year.
Annual net interest expense is estimated to be approximately $75 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Year-to-date, we have opened a total of 27 stores and have closed 9 stores. Earlier this month, we opened Beyond at Liberty View, a unique shopping experience in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, consisting of 4 of our retail concepts under 1 roof, including Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Value. In addition, we opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We remain on track with our fiscal 2016 model to open approximately 30 stores, most of which are in new markets for our various concepts, and close approximately 15.
Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. We expect to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization and anticipate the completion of this program to occur sometime in fiscal 2020. Of course, the plan -- the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflect our 9-month results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and our recent business trends, we are modeling our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be at the low end of this historical range.
We are currently in the process of completing our financial planning assumptions for fiscal 2017, which, as a reminder, is a 53-week year. We will provide further information related our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter conference call, which is planned for April 5, 2017.
With that, I will turn the call over to Steven."

This reflects the increasing proportion of sales moving online through various digital platforms. Within this environment, we've been working continuously to evolve our company and expand the breadth of the differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. By providing real answers to our customer needs at the right time and at the right value, we can further strengthen our credibility as the experts for the home and for our customers' accompanying life stages and life interests. 
Today, I will provide an update on some of the key developments in our business over the past several months and the progress we are making in transforming our company to be increasingly relevant and to improve our competitive position in this ever-changing retail environment.
As we reported on November 23, we made an all-cash acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, an industry-leading online retailer of personalized products. The addition of PMall expands our existing personalization and customization capabilities and further enhances our offering of differentiated product, services and solutions to our customers. As we have said previously, we view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers. The market for personalized products is highly fragmented and estimated to be in excess of $15 billion, with a high single-digit annualized growth rate. Historically, demand has been largely driven by gifting occasions, peaking during the winter holiday season.
Over the past 18 years, PMall has developed into a highly successful and innovative company within the personalization category. A key competitive advantage is their fully integrated proprietary technology platform that drives quality, speed and efficiency. PMall's production facilities are capable of automating 14 different innovative personalization processes on a variety of surfaces. These processes include sublimation, embroidery, digital printing, engraving and sandblasting.
PMall already has a large assortment with the opportunity to grow. The assortment includes personalized products to commemorate all of life's events and special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, holidays and the welcoming of a child. Their streamlined production processes enable a 1-day average turnaround time. And importantly, they also share our passion for and commitment to excellent customer service. PMall will remain a distinct brand under the Bed Bath & Beyond umbrella, and we will support them as they continue to improve the customer experience by enhancing their product mix, upgrading their e-commerce website and driving optimization of their marketing initiatives.
As we described in our November 23 press release, we expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share. Going forward, there are synergies that should result in future cost savings and efficiencies in areas including shipping and marketing.
While PMall remain a distinct brand, at the same time, we already have nearly 5,000 items available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites and in-store through the Beyond store that can be personalized. We believe there's an extensive opportunity to grow this assortment. We're excited to partner with PMall and leverage their advanced personalization and production capabilities to further advance our personalization capabilities across our other concepts.
In addition to growing our assortment of personalized products, we've also continued to build out our product and service offerings within other categories, notably furniture and home decor. As we have previously said, the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment that includes unique and differentiated product that will engage with our customers in a meaningful way by providing inspiration, solutions and services across various lifestyles.
Also, we recently introduced a new home decor feature, a drapery design gallery, to be available in select stores and online at bedbathandbeyond.com. Customers can customize draperies for their home by choosing from 250 fabrics, 3 header styles and 4 lanes. In just a few simple steps, customers can select the look and style of the window treatment that best fits their home decor.
To showcase our expanded offering, including within the home furnishing and decor categories and our expertise for the home, we released our first-ever Welcome home! catalog in early October, containing 84 pages of product inspiration for the entire home. 
In some respects, we're at the beginning stages of building awareness of our wide-ranging assortment of differentiated products, services and solutions for the home and the accompanying life stages and life interests through a more inspirational imagery and content. Catalogs of this type are one way to introduce customers to these expanded offerings and our broad-based expertise.
While the results of the catalog will include the benefits of longer-term brand building, we are pleased with the initial reception of the book and the positive feedback from customers. Based on the initial results, we plan to release another home catalog this spring to further reinforce our position as the expert for the home.
Also, to further these efforts, we are bringing a significant portion of our creative and photography work in-house and hiring a team of about 70 people who will work together alongside existing One Kings Lane creative and photography staff and our new creative and photo studios in Manhattan. We believe bringing more of these capabilities in-house will allow us to have greater control over our ability to produce more inspirational content. In addition, we expect this effort to help increase our digital marketing assets and drive other operational efficiencies for the business.
During the third quarter, other marketing initiatives included the launch of a beta test for our new annual membership program called BEYOND+. For an annual fee of $29, which is being used in our test, members receive 20% off their purchases as well as free standard shipping on every order for an entire year. The initial test includes a small cross-section of our customer base, and we are currently monitoring the purchasing behavior of our members over time. We will formulate the next steps to this program based on the key learnings from the beta test, which to date remain encouraging.
In addition to elevating the customer experience through our product and marketing initiatives, we have also advanced our initiatives to elevate the experience within our stores. As Sue mentioned, we have opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We were excited to design this new store to reflect the lifestyle of the area and to feature merchandise inspired by its coastal location. The grand opening occurred last week, and we look forward to learning from our customers' response to our store. As you may recall, our first reformatted andThat! store opened this past April in Kennesaw, Georgia, and it continues to perform well.
A couple of weeks ago we opened the doors of our new shopping venue, Beyond at Liberty View, located in the Sunset Park community within Brooklyn. With approximately 120,000 square feet, this is a unique shopping destination that includes a Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values, all under 1 roof. For about 2 years now, we have worked to help transform this historic industrial complex constructed in the early 1900s into a vibrant retail space that showcases the products, services and solutions we have to offer today.
We believe the learnings generated from this initial Beyond experience will be beneficial to us in many ways. First, many of the aspects of what we've done here, including our enhanced assortment and services, can be rolled forward to other store locations. Second, we will iterate the entire experience in other settings where appropriate. This experience gives us tremendous clay to work with and continue to do more for and with our customers. We are very excited to be open in Brooklyn and service the local community and have planned our grand opening to take place during the Martin Luther King holiday weekend in January.
In addition to bringing Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values together in 1 location and under 1 roof, there are many features and services special to the Beyond venue. They include: an experiential environment where customers and their families can participate in product demonstrations, how-to sessions, cooking classes and other live events in our events space called '71 at Beyond, named after the year Bed Bath & Beyond was founded; a born in Brooklyn feature consisting of Brooklyn-based designers and their products; a seamless and more personalized shopping experience utilizing our latest digital tools to assist customers in finding the right merchandise for their homes and lifestyles, such as scan-for-more, which enable the customer to view product images and get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view an expanded assortment of product, such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and a digital product adviser, which enables customers to find what they are looking for based on responses to questions that filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs.
Also, a dedicated area called the Beyond Room for customers to work with our in-store experts for concierge services, such as our personal shopping, registry and soon-to-come decorating services; our curated collection called Best of New, which will feature the best new items from Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values. This collection will be located in the Beyond Room; a Blow In Blow Out bar where customers can make appointments with professional stylists to wash, blow and style their hair; additional special services such as home delivery, assembly and installation services; a unique food hall-style dining experience called the Bay Market Kitchen, which serves casual American cuisine as well as local craft beers and select lines. In addition to the restaurant, there are other food stations featuring local fare that change vendors on a regular basis and coffee bars featuring local favorites, such as Brooklyn-based Toby's Estate Coffee.
The Sunset Park community is a thriving and dynamic part of Brooklyn, and we're happy to be part of this growing and diverse neighborhood. We believe that this venue, including the revised format of our stores along with the enhanced services we offer, will become a retail destination for customers to have a fun and productive shopping experience. We hope many of you will be able to visit Beyond at Liberty View and give us your feedback.
In summary, it continues to be a transitional time for retail, and new advances in technology are creating opportunities for our customers to shop in a more seamless environment and for us to do more for and with our customers and connect with them in a more personalized manner. As our business transforms, we're navigating the competitive landscape and adapting as customer preferences and purchasing behavior evolve. We believe that we are making the right investments for our company's long-term success and are well positioned to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.
In closing, I would like to thank our dedicated associates, including our new team numbers from PMall, for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. I wish you all a healthy and happy holiday season and new year.
Janet, I'll turn the call back over to you."

We're trying to do the things that make sense for the company. So again, if you -- and we said it over and over again, but our focus is on the customer; how do we do more with the customer. And the ability to offer these services, the categories of product, the solutions that we can offer and how to leverage that is the goal. We start with the customer, trying to understand their interests, their life stage through analytics and target marketing to service them with this. So whether we're adding furniture and home decor, whether we're adding services or if we're adding differentiated product and personalized product, all these things are in keeping with what we're doing with our objective and our stated objective to do more with the customer. And so whether we add people by way of hiring people or we buy a small company or how we move forward, that's -- it's just a vehicle in a lot of ways. So all these things are giving us a better ability to deliver for the customer. So it's not that we're trying to get bigger, or there's nothing about ego here. It's all about being better. And so it's the same thing with disgorging. I mean we'll close stores when they make sense to close them. We'll move things out of a portfolio if it makes sense to do that. If we're providing certain types of services that don't make sense or that we can't make sense of, we'll stop doing it. First, we'll try to do it correctly, and then we would stop doing it. So it's not a matter -- we don't look at it as a size component of getting bigger or smaller. It's really just being better."

And the truth is, is that I think anybody who tells you what they'll be making 3 or 4 years out, it's just based upon a set of assumptions. And as everybody learns is that the further out you go, the more difficult it is to predict what it's going to be. A lot of these investments we've made have really been foundational for us. They've put us in a position to grow, and that's hopefully what will happen. But we can't -- we're not able to say. We don't know. We know for sure if we didn't make these investments, we'd be one of those companies that you wouldn't be talking to any more. So we're fortunate that we still make some of the best returns in retail. We know that it's not a sexy place to be today, retail. We know what our competitors are doing from a -- or not doing. So these investments are really intended to position us to grow our earnings. We won't be satisfied until we're growing our earnings again. I wish I could tell you exactly the day that would be, but it's just -- it's not the case. We're not going to be telling you something that's 3 or 4 years out. Obviously, things that we're working on, like the growth of our digital business, which has been so strong, the larger the component of our overall business our digital business becomes and we continue to grow it, that will be beneficial to us. If we're able to execute against a differentiated product, the services and solutions that we offer, that will help us to achieve greater profitability of the differentiated product. The margin structure is different. So all these things are component pieces of getting better and producing the better earnings. But it's the question that is the right question to ask, it's the question that we work towards accomplishing, but there just simply -- I can't tell you when that is. There's internal variables that we execute against that we think we're doing fairly well, and there's external things that are happening in the marketplace. Still the lion's share of our business is done in bricks and mortar. And the foot traffic that we're seeing, the reduction in foot traffic I think has been seen across all retail, and as long as we have a significant component in bricks and mortar like that, that is a bit of a headwind for us."

At the same time, when you talk about the services, whether we have the largest bridal registry, whether we are going to have the largest baby registry, the largest new mover business, all these things are important to deliver on those related services. When we talk about the decorating services or being able to have scheduled appointments to go and to create a registry, when we talk about the things that create the additional stickiness with the customer, the more experiential things that will increase foot traffic relative to where it is today, those are all critical elements of being different, but making sure the customer understands that we're different and we're delivering on the message that we're different. So it can't be done in one way. Again, it goes back to the inspirational content we're showing, all the things we're doing to make the customer feel as if we're the expert for the home. It's just not one road that we could travel. Each of these things are important to us. I understand that you were in a Brooklyn location, I think, today. So I mean, you'll see there some of the things that we're delivering to the customer, and not everything is even open yet. But again, those are the things that we're trying to explain to the customer. So if you could bring together the differentiated product, you could bring together the local product, if you could bring together different services that they -- that we offer and the expertise that we provide, all these things have to be -- you have to be great at them, the customer has to understand that you have them and you have to deliver on them. So I wouldn't say one is more important than the other. They're all critical to us."

So if you take some of the specialty services, the home delivery, the assembly, the installation, some of these things have been done elsewhere; that -- the growth of the food component that we have in the stores, the craft beer one that we sell directly ourselves. So all these things have -- some aspects of it have been in the works elsewhere, and we've taken these learnings and we've put it into this one venue. So those things are being rolled forward. And hopefully, as we open up new stores, they will not look like the old stores and to the customer, it'll be recognizably different. So we're taking those learnings now and moving them forward.

Again, we keep going back to that is that if we really want to create that -- if we want to be less sensitive to that direct competitive pricing model is that you have to have differentiated products, services and solutions. So we start with that and that's very important to us. However, when it comes to being at the right price or similar or the same merchandise, we've taken the position and we maintain that we have to be at that price so that if other people are -- with price transparency more so than ever, that you have to be at the right price and certain that that's the right price before the coupon. We can't have the coupon be a -- think that that's in any way an answer for us. It might be for some customers, it might be for some points in time, but we have to be at the right price without the use of a coupon. So that's the way we've thought. That's the way we think that we're constantly looking at and crawling our competitors' websites that we have a dynamic price capability that we are using today and growing it. And so it's all important that we -- and it's something that we report on with every buyer every day and with every planner. And we look at and measure ourselves against to make sure that we're at that right price because we don't believe that for a second that it's okay not to be.

So when we talk about all those life stages and life interests, truly, when I talked about baby and bridal and new mover and back to college and decorating, we have to be the first choice. We have to be the first choice for enthusiasts. We can't have it be a competitor when it comes to cookware or bakeware or when it comes to closet and storage. We have to be the first choice for these things. So it is important that we have that differentiated product, that we really do provide services and solutions that are better for the customer and they recognize that and that we do it through inspirational marketing and that we do it through better content. I was just looking before at something that we do versus one of our competitors in the cookware arena and how we show it online and how we talk about it and acknowledge that. And frankly, we're doing well. And so -- but these are the things that a customer has to see, so it's -- that step's critical to us because again, it can't be about the coupon. We have to be at the right price. There's all different things that are evolving, that there's product that's been -- that the vendors maintain pricing, everybody's at the same pricing, we've never been able to take a coupon on. That's not a new model. That's something that we understand. There's product that to a customer you say it's different but it might -- they might not understand how it's different, so we're not doing a good enough job of communicating, so we can't price it differently perhaps. But when it's the same product, the customer believes it's the same product, we have to be at that price pre-coupon. That to be at the wrong price going forward, the customer won't find you. When they go online, we're not going to be relevant. We're not going to show up in algorithms. We're not going to be in the right place if our pricing is wrong. New customers who come online don't understand even though we have a coupon that we -- what the coupon is or what it means. So for us to be reliant on a coupon and to be at the wrong price, it's just the wrong thought process. So when you said that we used to think that way, I don't know -- if somebody in the organization told you that, it's not the organizational think. We've never believed that we could be at a wrong price because of the coupon or the coupon protects us from being at the wrong price. Never the case."

So -- and then when you ask me what's the right price -- because look, that's something that literally is an interesting question. We have all these analysts now and they run all these algorithms and they'll come back with the conclusion of how you move the shopper. If you're within a certain percent or certain cents or at certain price points or certain times of the year and certain categories, you have to be at exactly the same price. So all those things are things that are not one answer across the board, in some cases, you have to be at the same price and maybe in some instances, if you were $0.10 higher or 2% higher, it might not be important if they're bundled with other things that only we carry perhaps. In some cases, if we're competing with somebody who's really a category killer, who's really known it, maybe we have to be below their price to be relevant. So all those things, there's not one answer. But generally, if you ask me that question, the general answer I'm going to tell you is at the same price is the general answer I would give."

That's a general all because never -- and many -- most things in life aren't all, but it happens to be because they all started small. They were pretty -- across the board, they're all growing. The other thing that we did talk about and that we acknowledge is that we haven't gone to great lengths to introduce our customers to these other categories today. It's critical that we be great in our core categories. It's critical to us, I think, that we be great and really be really close ancillary categories. At that point, we would make sense to start introducing them to everything else that we sell. At that point, we would know about our customer. We'll know more about their life stage, their life interests, what they've shopped for, what they've searched for, where they've searched on other sites, where they've come from, where they've gone to when they left our site to be able to offer them the other product that we sell. But for today, we really haven't gone to really any length to really introduce the customer to all the other things we're adding. It will be there and at the point in time that we're prepared to do that, the assortment will be rich. There's so many things about it. A lot of it is vendor direct. So a lot of it we have to get relationships with these vendors to have confidence in their capabilities to satisfy the customer, to deliver to the customer. If you look at certain categories and you look at the search and how you search for it on our site, you would be disappointed. You would look at things and say, ""My god, that's not best-in-class,"" in some of these categories. So to be running to introduce the customer to certain categories today when we don't do it well, when we really have to double down on our core categories to make the customer understand how we're different, why we're different, why we're great at them, it's just -- it hasn't been the appropriate time. When you take a look at the 84-page home catalog that we did, that's perhaps a first step into introducing to the customer that all of the -- a number of other things that we sell are categories that we sell. So that's really maybe from the first time a content piece has gone out, to even introduce it to them in a large scale and that book was a very limited book. In the spring, we'll have the opportunity to expand upon that. But it's really hasn't something that -- I think if you were to ask 9 out of 10 customers, maybe I shouldn't be giving numbers, but most customers, a lot of the categories we added that we carry, they'd be surprised. I know that, Gene tells me stories all the time, it's about family members who don't know. I count on Gene to make sure these are good communication vehicles for us. So it's a big opportunity for us, but we're not in a rush to be off with something. We're in a -- so we will get there. But for the time being, we're adding to our website. We're organizing it so it can be searched. We're learning the vendors to make sure that they could deliver on our promise of service for our customer and at the appropriate time, we'll introduce the customer to the expanded offering."

It really has more to do with coming to the end of a term, not being able to negotiate a favorable occupancy, looking out over the -- over a future time of the lease with our expectations of what's happening with foot traffic. Also, we look at what business do we pick up in a market if we -- without the cannibalization. We look at the other impacts of closing a store because getting to your last part of the question, the third part of the question, the stores are critical. The stores not only for their 4-wall profitability, but the stores also today for the appointment scheduling, to start a registry, to buy online and pick up in a store, to be able to buy expanded assortment and return something in a store, those things are critical. The store in a market drives online digital business. It drives it, the visibility of the store. So all those reasons why the stores are important. And the middle -- the second part of the question, I guess, which is the run rate question is that there really isn't a run rate. I mean, these are independent decisions being made based upon what's coming available to renegotiate and the landlord's flexibility and the impact of keeping it open or closed based upon the new economics. So if you told me that every landlord was going to cut their occupancy in half, I would tell you that the run rate would be one thing. If you told us that everybody was going to try to have one piece of the flavor of the day, then there would be something else. But I don't -- it's not fair to say a run rate.

It's very -- it's on the margins."

So this is -- talk to every millennial. When you say what would have more, I think it really depends upon an individual. I think that when you talk about a millennial, really, I think the business opportunity is where we're growing our digital business. When you talk about a millennial, you're talking about the social media that to do -- when they see -- when we look at our experience with Instagram or with Facebook and you see that when we're improving those vehicles to communicate with the customer and you see the response rate increase, when you look at the ability to drive better content online, when you look at being able to be more inspirational, I think all that will register well with the millennials. So when you talk about, well, do you think that the beta program or the -- that, I don't think it's those types of things. I think it's really reaching the millennial customer where they are. And it starts with our Back to College business, it starts with our bridal business, with our BABY business, with our new mover business. Those are opportunities to address this customer to provide them a great experience, learn about what they're doing, what they're interested in, what they're doing next to communicate to them what we have to offer and how we're providing solutions for them to create that stickiness.

And we -- and as far as this quarter itself that we just reported on, we were seeing that sequential improvement from both our first and second quarter right up until that week before the election. And then after the election, we started to improve again, but we had a couple very bad weeks. And we had a strong Black Friday through that Monday, and we're anticipating a positive comp for the fourth quarter. So -- but given that all -- in totality, it would all be better with stronger foot traffic. And by the way and just to be clear about it because Seth asked a great question, that this is our model. And we always want to beat our model, but it's our model. But to the extent that we underperform our model and it doesn't come in as planned, then it does jeopardize the entire model. So to the extent that we were -- thought that we'd be stronger in terms of the range at the beginning of the year and now we're less strong within that range, listen, if things were worse, we would be out of the range, so all those things are the reality of building the model.

And for those of you who may have holiday parties to get to tonight, here are some highlights. Third quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.85. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior-year period. Quarterly comparable sales decreased approximately 1.4%. Sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20%, and sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range. 
In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%. Fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share are expected to be at the low end of the range we have described in our previous earnings press releases.
During our call today, Sue will review our third quarter financial results and some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, and then Steven will give an update on some operational strategic developments, including the recent acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, which is known as PMall.com and PMall. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue."

I'll start with a review of our third quarter results, which include the activity of PMall for the last few days of the quarter. Our net sales for the quarter were approximately $3 billion, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from the third quarter of last year, primarily due to a 1.5% increase in non-comp sales, including One Kings Lane and new stores, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in comp sales.
As we expected, our third quarter comp sales trends were running sequentially better than the second quarter. However, sales softened considerably a week before the presidential election. After the election, comp sales picked back up and, in fact, we experienced relatively strong comp sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. 
Overall for the quarter, the decline in comp sales was attributable to a decrease in the number of transactions in our stores, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. Comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% in the third quarter, while comp sales from our stores declined in the low single-digit percentage range.
As a reminder, One Kings Lane and PMall are both currently excluded from our comp sales calculations. PMall will be included after the 1-year anniversary of its acquisition. One Kings Lane will be included in comp when the re-platforming of its systems and integration of its support services, both of which are currently in process, have been in place for a period long enough to allow for a meaningful comparison of One Kings Lane's sales over the prior period. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was approximately 37% as compared to approximately 37.8% in the prior-year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude: first, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense as a result of more promotional shipping offer activity, including a change in the Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping threshold from $49 last year to $29 this year and for a few days, we offered free shipping on all purchases; and second, an increase in coupon expense resulting from increases in redemption and the average coupon amount. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total company gross margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 13 basis points in the third quarter.
SG&A for the third quarter was approximately 29.8% of net sales as compared to 27.9% of net sales in the prior-year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses and an increase in technology expenses, included related depreciation. The inclusion of One Kings Lane increased total company SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 15 basis points in the third quarter.
Our income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 34.5% compared to approximately 35.3% in the prior-year period. The third quarter provisions included favorable net after-tax benefits of approximately $6 million this year as compared to $6.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.85 for the quarter.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with approximately $559 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $3.2 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 1.4% compared to the end of the prior-year period, due in part to the growth in inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers as well as the inventory balances from PMall and One Kings Lane.
Our Lewisville, Texas facility, which opened for inbound freight last quarter, began direct shipments to customers during the third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
Capital expenditures for the 9 months of 2016 were approximately $276 million and included the following: enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investments in data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including our new POS system; the re-platforming of One Kings Lane systems and integration of its support services; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; and investments in new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments.
We opened 10 new stores during the quarter, including 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 4 of which were in Canada; 4 buybuy BABY stores, 3 of which were in Canada; and 1 Face Value store. We also closed 8 Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $76 million of stock, representing about 1.8 million shares under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.9 billion at the end of the third quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on April 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2017.
Now, again, here are some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2016, which incorporate our year-to-date results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and recent business conditions. Given the comp in the fourth quarter to date and our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including the critical days leading up to Christmas, we are modeling a full year comp sales decline of approximately 50 basis points with net sales increasing about 1%. 
We continue to model gross margin deleverage for the full year, including increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. We said previously that we expect the gross margin deleverage to be slightly less than in fiscal 2015. Including the extension of Bed Bath & Beyond's $29 free shipping threshold, the slight deleverage from One Kings Lane and a slight leverage from PMall, we are modeling the full year gross margin deleverage to be relatively flat with fiscal 2015.
We continue to model SG&A as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the full year, primarily due to: payroll and payroll-related items, including wage increases; further investments in technology, including related depreciation; and advertising expense. This assumption includes slight deleverage for One Kings Lane and PMall.
As a reminder, last year in the fourth quarter, SG&A included certain nonrecurring items which benefited our fiscal 2015 full year net earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. We continue to estimate depreciation expense of approximately $290 million for the year.
Annual net interest expense is estimated to be approximately $75 million. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range, with continued quarterly tax rate variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Year-to-date, we have opened a total of 27 stores and have closed 9 stores. Earlier this month, we opened Beyond at Liberty View, a unique shopping experience in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, consisting of 4 of our retail concepts under 1 roof, including Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Value. In addition, we opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We remain on track with our fiscal 2016 model to open approximately 30 stores, most of which are in new markets for our various concepts, and close approximately 15.
Capital expenditures in 2016 continue to be planned in the range of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. We expect to repurchase shares under our current $2.5 billion authorization and anticipate the completion of this program to occur sometime in fiscal 2020. Of course, the plan -- the completion will continue to be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
As we have described previously, our net earnings per diluted share have been in the $4.50 to just over $5 range since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. Based on the planning assumptions I just discussed, which reflect our 9-month results including One Kings Lane and PMall since their dates of acquisition and our recent business trends, we are modeling our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share to be at the low end of this historical range.
We are currently in the process of completing our financial planning assumptions for fiscal 2017, which, as a reminder, is a 53-week year. We will provide further information related our modeling assumptions for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter conference call, which is planned for April 5, 2017.
With that, I will turn the call over to Steven."

This reflects the increasing proportion of sales moving online through various digital platforms. Within this environment, we've been working continuously to evolve our company and expand the breadth of the differentiated products, services and solutions we offer. By providing real answers to our customer needs at the right time and at the right value, we can further strengthen our credibility as the experts for the home and for our customers' accompanying life stages and life interests. 
Today, I will provide an update on some of the key developments in our business over the past several months and the progress we are making in transforming our company to be increasingly relevant and to improve our competitive position in this ever-changing retail environment.
As we reported on November 23, we made an all-cash acquisition of PersonalizationMall.com, an industry-leading online retailer of personalized products. The addition of PMall expands our existing personalization and customization capabilities and further enhances our offering of differentiated product, services and solutions to our customers. As we have said previously, we view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers. The market for personalized products is highly fragmented and estimated to be in excess of $15 billion, with a high single-digit annualized growth rate. Historically, demand has been largely driven by gifting occasions, peaking during the winter holiday season.
Over the past 18 years, PMall has developed into a highly successful and innovative company within the personalization category. A key competitive advantage is their fully integrated proprietary technology platform that drives quality, speed and efficiency. PMall's production facilities are capable of automating 14 different innovative personalization processes on a variety of surfaces. These processes include sublimation, embroidery, digital printing, engraving and sandblasting.
PMall already has a large assortment with the opportunity to grow. The assortment includes personalized products to commemorate all of life's events and special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, holidays and the welcoming of a child. Their streamlined production processes enable a 1-day average turnaround time. And importantly, they also share our passion for and commitment to excellent customer service. PMall will remain a distinct brand under the Bed Bath & Beyond umbrella, and we will support them as they continue to improve the customer experience by enhancing their product mix, upgrading their e-commerce website and driving optimization of their marketing initiatives.
As we described in our November 23 press release, we expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share. Going forward, there are synergies that should result in future cost savings and efficiencies in areas including shipping and marketing.
While PMall remain a distinct brand, at the same time, we already have nearly 5,000 items available on the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY websites and in-store through the Beyond store that can be personalized. We believe there's an extensive opportunity to grow this assortment. We're excited to partner with PMall and leverage their advanced personalization and production capabilities to further advance our personalization capabilities across our other concepts.
In addition to growing our assortment of personalized products, we've also continued to build out our product and service offerings within other categories, notably furniture and home decor. As we have previously said, the home furnishing space provides tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment that includes unique and differentiated product that will engage with our customers in a meaningful way by providing inspiration, solutions and services across various lifestyles.
Also, we recently introduced a new home decor feature, a drapery design gallery, to be available in select stores and online at bedbathandbeyond.com. Customers can customize draperies for their home by choosing from 250 fabrics, 3 header styles and 4 lanes. In just a few simple steps, customers can select the look and style of the window treatment that best fits their home decor.
To showcase our expanded offering, including within the home furnishing and decor categories and our expertise for the home, we released our first-ever Welcome home! catalog in early October, containing 84 pages of product inspiration for the entire home. 
In some respects, we're at the beginning stages of building awareness of our wide-ranging assortment of differentiated products, services and solutions for the home and the accompanying life stages and life interests through a more inspirational imagery and content. Catalogs of this type are one way to introduce customers to these expanded offerings and our broad-based expertise.
While the results of the catalog will include the benefits of longer-term brand building, we are pleased with the initial reception of the book and the positive feedback from customers. Based on the initial results, we plan to release another home catalog this spring to further reinforce our position as the expert for the home.
Also, to further these efforts, we are bringing a significant portion of our creative and photography work in-house and hiring a team of about 70 people who will work together alongside existing One Kings Lane creative and photography staff and our new creative and photo studios in Manhattan. We believe bringing more of these capabilities in-house will allow us to have greater control over our ability to produce more inspirational content. In addition, we expect this effort to help increase our digital marketing assets and drive other operational efficiencies for the business.
During the third quarter, other marketing initiatives included the launch of a beta test for our new annual membership program called BEYOND+. For an annual fee of $29, which is being used in our test, members receive 20% off their purchases as well as free standard shipping on every order for an entire year. The initial test includes a small cross-section of our customer base, and we are currently monitoring the purchasing behavior of our members over time. We will formulate the next steps to this program based on the key learnings from the beta test, which to date remain encouraging.
In addition to elevating the customer experience through our product and marketing initiatives, we have also advanced our initiatives to elevate the experience within our stores. As Sue mentioned, we have opened our second reformatted andThat! store, which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. We were excited to design this new store to reflect the lifestyle of the area and to feature merchandise inspired by its coastal location. The grand opening occurred last week, and we look forward to learning from our customers' response to our store. As you may recall, our first reformatted andThat! store opened this past April in Kennesaw, Georgia, and it continues to perform well.
A couple of weeks ago we opened the doors of our new shopping venue, Beyond at Liberty View, located in the Sunset Park community within Brooklyn. With approximately 120,000 square feet, this is a unique shopping destination that includes a Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values, all under 1 roof. For about 2 years now, we have worked to help transform this historic industrial complex constructed in the early 1900s into a vibrant retail space that showcases the products, services and solutions we have to offer today.
We believe the learnings generated from this initial Beyond experience will be beneficial to us in many ways. First, many of the aspects of what we've done here, including our enhanced assortment and services, can be rolled forward to other store locations. Second, we will iterate the entire experience in other settings where appropriate. This experience gives us tremendous clay to work with and continue to do more for and with our customers. We are very excited to be open in Brooklyn and service the local community and have planned our grand opening to take place during the Martin Luther King holiday weekend in January.
In addition to bringing Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values together in 1 location and under 1 roof, there are many features and services special to the Beyond venue. They include: an experiential environment where customers and their families can participate in product demonstrations, how-to sessions, cooking classes and other live events in our events space called '71 at Beyond, named after the year Bed Bath & Beyond was founded; a born in Brooklyn feature consisting of Brooklyn-based designers and their products; a seamless and more personalized shopping experience utilizing our latest digital tools to assist customers in finding the right merchandise for their homes and lifestyles, such as scan-for-more, which enable the customer to view product images and get product pricing information as well as customer reviews; interactive catalogs, which enable customers to view an expanded assortment of product, such as seasonal furniture and bed and bath items; and a digital product adviser, which enables customers to find what they are looking for based on responses to questions that filter the assortment to products that best fit their needs.
Also, a dedicated area called the Beyond Room for customers to work with our in-store experts for concierge services, such as our personal shopping, registry and soon-to-come decorating services; our curated collection called Best of New, which will feature the best new items from Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Cost Plus World Market and Face Values. This collection will be located in the Beyond Room; a Blow In Blow Out bar where customers can make appointments with professional stylists to wash, blow and style their hair; additional special services such as home delivery, assembly and installation services; a unique food hall-style dining experience called the Bay Market Kitchen, which serves casual American cuisine as well as local craft beers and select lines. In addition to the restaurant, there are other food stations featuring local fare that change vendors on a regular basis and coffee bars featuring local favorites, such as Brooklyn-based Toby's Estate Coffee.
The Sunset Park community is a thriving and dynamic part of Brooklyn, and we're happy to be part of this growing and diverse neighborhood. We believe that this venue, including the revised format of our stores along with the enhanced services we offer, will become a retail destination for customers to have a fun and productive shopping experience. We hope many of you will be able to visit Beyond at Liberty View and give us your feedback.
In summary, it continues to be a transitional time for retail, and new advances in technology are creating opportunities for our customers to shop in a more seamless environment and for us to do more for and with our customers and connect with them in a more personalized manner. As our business transforms, we're navigating the competitive landscape and adapting as customer preferences and purchasing behavior evolve. We believe that we are making the right investments for our company's long-term success and are well positioned to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.
In closing, I would like to thank our dedicated associates, including our new team numbers from PMall, for their ongoing efforts to satisfy our customers and improve our competitive position in the categories in which we do business. I wish you all a healthy and happy holiday season and new year.
Janet, I'll turn the call back over to you."

And the ability to offer these services, the categories of product, the solutions that we can offer and how to leverage that is the goal. We start with the customer, trying to understand their interests, their life stage through analytics and target marketing to service them with this. So whether we're adding furniture and home decor, whether we're adding services or if we're adding differentiated product and personalized product, all these things are in keeping with what we're doing with our objective and our stated objective to do more with the customer.

And as everybody learns is that the further out you go, the more difficult it is to predict what it's going to be. A lot of these investments we've made have really been foundational for us. They've put us in a position to grow, and that's hopefully what will happen. But we can't -- we're not able to say. We don't know. We know for sure if we didn't make these investments, we'd be one of those companies that you wouldn't be talking to any more. So we're fortunate that we still make some of the best returns in retail. We know that it's not a sexy place to be today, retail. We know what our competitors are doing from a -- or not doing. So these investments are really intended to position us to grow our earnings. We won't be satisfied until we're growing our earnings again. I wish I could tell you exactly the day that would be, but it's just -- it's not the case. We're not going to be telling you something that's 3 or 4 years out. Obviously, things that we're working on, like the growth of our digital business, which has been so strong, the larger the component of our overall business our digital business becomes and we continue to grow it, that will be beneficial to us. If we're able to execute against a differentiated product, the services and solutions that we offer, that will help us to achieve greater profitability of the differentiated product. The margin structure is different. So all these things are component pieces of getting better and producing the better earnings. But it's the question that is the right question to ask, it's the question that we work towards accomplishing, but there just simply -- I can't tell you when that is. There's internal variables that we execute against that we think we're doing fairly well, and there's external things that are happening in the marketplace. Still the lion's share of our business is done in bricks and mortar. And the foot traffic that we're seeing, the reduction in foot traffic I think has been seen across all retail, and as long as we have a significant component in bricks and mortar like that, that is a bit of a headwind for us."

At the same time, when you talk about the services, whether we have the largest bridal registry, whether we are going to have the largest baby registry, the largest new mover business, all these things are important to deliver on those related services. When we talk about the decorating services or being able to have scheduled appointments to go and to create a registry, when we talk about the things that create the additional stickiness with the customer, the more experiential things that will increase foot traffic relative to where it is today, those are all critical elements of being different, but making sure the customer understands that we're different and we're delivering on the message that we're different. So it can't be done in one way. Again, it goes back to the inspirational content we're showing, all the things we're doing to make the customer feel as if we're the expert for the home. It's just not one road that we could travel. Each of these things are important to us. I understand that you were in a Brooklyn location, I think, today. So I mean, you'll see there some of the things that we're delivering to the customer, and not everything is even open yet. But again, those are the things that we're trying to explain to the customer. So if you could bring together the differentiated product, you could bring together the local product, if you could bring together different services that they -- that we offer and the expertise that we provide, all these things have to be -- you have to be great at them, the customer has to understand that you have them and you have to deliver on them. So I wouldn't say one is more important than the other. They're all critical to us."

So if you take some of the specialty services, the home delivery, the assembly, the installation, some of these things have been done elsewhere; that -- the growth of the food component that we have in the stores, the craft beer one that we sell directly ourselves. So all these things have -- some aspects of it have been in the works elsewhere, and we've taken these learnings and we've put it into this one venue. So those things are being rolled forward.

Again, we keep going back to that is that if we really want to create that -- if we want to be less sensitive to that direct competitive pricing model is that you have to have differentiated products, services and solutions. So we start with that and that's very important to us. However, when it comes to being at the right price or similar or the same merchandise, we've taken the position and we maintain that we have to be at that price so that if other people are -- with price transparency more so than ever, that you have to be at the right price and certain that that's the right price before the coupon. We can't have the coupon be a -- think that that's in any way an answer for us. It might be for some customers, it might be for some points in time, but we have to be at the right price without the use of a coupon. So that's the way we've thought. That's the way we think that we're constantly looking at and crawling our competitors' websites that we have a dynamic price capability that we are using today and growing it. And so it's all important that we -- and it's something that we report on with every buyer every day and with every planner.

So when we talk about all those life stages and life interests, truly, when I talked about baby and bridal and new mover and back to college and decorating, we have to be the first choice. We have to be the first choice for enthusiasts. We can't have it be a competitor when it comes to cookware or bakeware or when it comes to closet and storage. We have to be the first choice for these things. So it is important that we have that differentiated product, that we really do provide services and solutions that are better for the customer and they recognize that and that we do it through inspirational marketing and that we do it through better content. I was just looking before at something that we do versus one of our competitors in the cookware arena and how we show it online and how we talk about it and acknowledge that. And frankly, we're doing well. And so -- but these are the things that a customer has to see, so it's -- that step's critical to us because again, it can't be about the coupon. We have to be at the right price. There's all different things that are evolving, that there's product that's been -- that the vendors maintain pricing, everybody's at the same pricing, we've never been able to take a coupon on. That's not a new model. That's something that we understand. There's product that to a customer you say it's different but it might -- they might not understand how it's different, so we're not doing a good enough job of communicating, so we can't price it differently perhaps. But when it's the same product, the customer believes it's the same product, we have to be at that price pre-coupon. That to be at the wrong price going forward, the customer won't find you. When they go online, we're not going to be relevant. We're not going to show up in algorithms. We're not going to be in the right place if our pricing is wrong. New customers who come online don't understand even though we have a coupon that we -- what the coupon is or what it means. So for us to be reliant on a coupon and to be at the wrong price, it's just the wrong thought process. So when you said that we used to think that way, I don't know -- if somebody in the organization told you that, it's not the organizational think. We've never believed that we could be at a wrong price because of the coupon or the coupon protects us from being at the wrong price. Never the case."

So they're all competitors. Now, the overlap of merchandise with a Walmart is far different or to a Target maybe less so, with an Amazon in a different way. So -- but for the same product, all those places are very relevant. So to the extent they were at the wrong price, it's you were at the wrong price. So -- and then when you ask me what's the right price -- because look, that's something that literally is an interesting question. We have all these analysts now and they run all these algorithms and they'll come back with the conclusion of how you move the shopper. If you're within a certain percent or certain cents or at certain price points or certain times of the year and certain categories, you have to be at exactly the same price. So all those things are things that are not one answer across the board, in some cases, you have to be at the same price and maybe in some instances, if you were $0.10 higher or 2% higher, it might not be important if they're bundled with other things that only we carry perhaps. In some cases, if we're competing with somebody who's really a category killer, who's really known it, maybe we have to be below their price to be relevant.

That's a general all because never -- and many -- most things in life aren't all, but it happens to be because they all started small. They were pretty -- across the board, they're all growing. The other thing that we did talk about and that we acknowledge is that we haven't gone to great lengths to introduce our customers to these other categories today. It's critical that we be great in our core categories. It's critical to us, I think, that we be great and really be really close ancillary categories. At that point, we would make sense to start introducing them to everything else that we sell. At that point, we would know about our customer. We'll know more about their life stage, their life interests, what they've shopped for, what they've searched for, where they've searched on other sites, where they've come from, where they've gone to when they left our site to be able to offer them the other product that we sell. But for today, we really haven't gone to really any length to really introduce the customer to all the other things we're adding. It will be there and at the point in time that we're prepared to do that, the assortment will be rich. There's so many things about it. A lot of it is vendor direct. So a lot of it we have to get relationships with these vendors to have confidence in their capabilities to satisfy the customer, to deliver to the customer. If you look at certain categories and you look at the search and how you search for it on our site, you would be disappointed. You would look at things and say, ""My god, that's not best-in-class,"" in some of these categories. So to be running to introduce the customer to certain categories today when we don't do it well, when we really have to double down on our core categories to make the customer understand how we're different, why we're different, why we're great at them, it's just -- it hasn't been the appropriate time. When you take a look at the 84-page home catalog that we did, that's perhaps a first step into introducing to the customer that all of the -- a number of other things that we sell are categories that we sell. So that's really maybe from the first time a content piece has gone out, to even introduce it to them in a large scale and that book was a very limited book. In the spring, we'll have the opportunity to expand upon that. But it's really hasn't something that -- I think if you were to ask 9 out of 10 customers, maybe I shouldn't be giving numbers, but most customers, a lot of the categories we added that we carry, they'd be surprised. I know that, Gene tells me stories all the time, it's about family members who don't know. I count on Gene to make sure these are good communication vehicles for us. So it's a big opportunity for us, but we're not in a rush to be off with something. We're in a -- so we will get there. But for the time being, we're adding to our website. We're organizing it so it can be searched. We're learning the vendors to make sure that they could deliver on our promise of service for our customer and at the appropriate time, we'll introduce the customer to the expanded offering."

It really has more to do with coming to the end of a term, not being able to negotiate a favorable occupancy, looking out over the -- over a future time of the lease with our expectations of what's happening with foot traffic. Also, we look at what business do we pick up in a market if we -- without the cannibalization. We look at the other impacts of closing a store because getting to your last part of the question, the third part of the question, the stores are critical. The stores not only for their 4-wall profitability, but the stores also today for the appointment scheduling, to start a registry, to buy online and pick up in a store, to be able to buy expanded assortment and return something in a store, those things are critical. The store in a market drives online digital business. It drives it, the visibility of the store. So all those reasons why the stores are important. And the middle -- the second part of the question, I guess, which is the run rate question is that there really isn't a run rate. I mean, these are independent decisions being made based upon what's coming available to renegotiate and the landlord's flexibility and the impact of keeping it open or closed based upon the new economics. So if you told me that every landlord was going to cut their occupancy in half, I would tell you that the run rate would be one thing. If you told us that everybody was going to try to have one piece of the flavor of the day, then there would be something else. But I don't -- it's not fair to say a run rate. We really are making independent decisions in each case trying to make the right decision."

We were -- I guess it was the case that we expected this, that we've expected this over time, that the course there is that we could drive and grow our digital business, the better off we'll be in that sense in terms of our top line. And we -- and as far as this quarter itself that we just reported on, we were seeing that sequential improvement from both our first and second quarter right up until that week before the election. And then after the election, we started to improve again, but we had a couple very bad weeks. And we had a strong Black Friday through that Monday, and we're anticipating a positive comp for the fourth quarter. So -- but given that all -- in totality, it would all be better with stronger foot traffic. And by the way and just to be clear about it because Seth asked a great question, that this is our model. And we always want to beat our model, but it's our model. But to the extent that we underperform our model and it doesn't come in as planned, then it does jeopardize the entire model. So to the extent that we were -- thought that we'd be stronger in terms of the range at the beginning of the year and now we're less strong within that range, listen, if things were worse, we would be out of the range, so all those things are the reality of building the model.
