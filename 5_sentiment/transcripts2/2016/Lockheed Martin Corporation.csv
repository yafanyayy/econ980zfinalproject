Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. As today's release illustrates, we completed another quarter of solid operational accomplishments while exceeding all of our full year financial goals, and I couldn't be more proud of our team. They remain focused on mission success for our customers and financial results for stockholders while also supporting extensive portfolio reshaping actions. 
We have a number of significant events to discuss today. In addition to reviewing our financial and operational results, I want to provide an update on the FY '16 DoD budget and a discussion of 2 completed strategic actions: the closure of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft and our decision to separate and combine our Information Systems & Global Solutions business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Financially, 2015 was an exceptional year with achievement of multiple, new high watermarks for the corporation. I was especially pleased to see the broad-based domestic and international customer support for our portfolio of products. This support resulted in our achieving a record level of backlog of nearly $100 billion. Excluding the acquired Sikorsky backlog, the rest of our portfolio achieved $84 billion, significantly surpassing the $80 billion goal we outlined at the beginning of 2015. Our backlog has us positioned to deliver expanding sales levels and financial results as we move forward in 2016 and beyond. 
A second area where we achieved another high watermark was the generation of over $5 billion in cash from operations, achieving a record annual level for the corporation in this critically important area. This cash flow is only achieved through the daily efforts and focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers. The robust cash generation also enabled us to expand our cash return to stockholders to a record annual level of $5 billion, achieved through our industry-leading dividend payout level and ongoing share repurchase activity. For 2015, share repurchases reduced the year-end outstanding share count to approximately 305 million shares. We are well on our way to achieve or exceed our goal to reduce the outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017. Overall, the corporation continue to excel in the attributes we most value: providing critical solutions to customer and returning value to stockholders. 
Looking beyond 2015, our 2016 guidance outlined today results in increased sales, earnings per share and growing cash from operations. The guidance includes the Sikorsky financials from the recently completed acquisition and also reflects the realignment of our information technology and Technical Services businesses. The guidance also assumes continuation of the results for the full year of 2016 from the Information Systems and Global Solutions business identified in our strategic review. We will adjust our financial outlook later this year when the disposition of IS&GS is completed. Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. 
I'd like to briefly discuss the defense budget. Since we spoke last quarter, significant uncertainty was removed with the successful completion of a bipartisan agreement of the FY '16-based DoD budget. The new budget reflects an annual increase of approximately $25 billion, above the previously planned budget level and is also the first increase in annual DoD budget since 2012. The budget is a recognition of increasing global security requirements and the need to allocate additional fiscal resources to respond to the threat environment. A key element in the increased DoD budget is a double-digit annual percentage increase in the investment accounts that fund new equipment procurement and research development -- research and development activities. This strong funding increase will be used to address the acute need to replace aging equipment while ensuring development of key new technologies to respond to evolving security requirements facing domestic and international customers. As part of the budget, we were pleased to see 11 additional F-35 aircraft added in the FY '16 omnibus. This marks the first time in the history of the F-35 program that aircraft were added to the baseline request, demonstrating strong support for our largest program. We believe our portfolio of products and new technologies will line up very well with essential recapitalization actions in the areas of missile defense, tactical missiles and Rotary aircraft. 
I'd like to now turn to the 2 strategic actions we announced back in July. First, we were proud to welcome the Sikorsky team to Lockheed Martin with the successful closure of their acquisition on November 6. Together, we will build upon a legacy of innovation and performance that has shaped the history of aviation for more than a century. This action advances our commitment to provide customers with affordable mission-ready solutions in rotary aircraft. Their inclusion will enable us to move forward with our goal to expand our business into the strategically important areas of helicopter production and sustainment. Since the transaction closure, the combined team at Mission Systems and Training have hit the ground running. We are already seeing accelerated customer interest in both military and search and rescue opportunities emerging in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. It is increasingly clear that we will be better together as we leverage our combined scale and serve as a technology leader at the forefront of vertical lift. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term value creation of this business as we move forward in providing essential products and solutions to customers around the world. 
Turning to our second strategic item. As announced earlier today, we completed the review of our Information Systems & Global Solutions businesses. That review culminated in our decision to separate and combine our IS&GS business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We are excited about this path forward and believe this is the best fit strategically and will be beneficial to the shareholders of both corporations. This transaction is an important milestone in the portfolio-shaping strategy we announced last July and allows us to focus on our core business in aerospace and defense. The combination of a proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a more more diversified competitor positioned for growth and future success while unlocking value for our stockholders. This agreement aligns the IS&GS business with an industry leader in government IT and technical services and will create an enterprise capable of providing unparalleled solutions in industries ranging from national security to health and life sciences. The complementary portfolios of both companies will create a diversified and balanced business mix with expanded domain expertise, increased advantages of scale efficiencies and synergy opportunities. These benefits will be the foundation to create value for stockholders, customers and employees. One of the important goals in our strategic evaluation of the business was to ensure that the final decision provides a good cultural fit and home for IS&GS employees. It is my belief that employee morale and opportunities for their growth are key elements in the future success of every enterprise. Over the last few months, during our many interactions with Leidos, we have come to know their management and culture, and we are confident that this combination fully satisfies our employee goal. Bruce will speak more about the financial aspects of the transaction and the projected time line for closure in his remarks. 
I'd like to end my remarks with a few key operational highlights in the fourth quarter that enabled the corporation to finish the year on a very strong note. Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we we achieved our full year delivery goal of 45 aircraft to domestic and international customers. This delivery level reflects our continuing ramp-up in production on the program and is a 25% increase above prior year delivery. For 2016, we are expecting additional production expansion with planned deliveries increasing to 53 aircraft. The team also continued to retire key tests on the F-35 development program as we look forward to completing remaining tests in 2016 as the development phase winds down. 
Switching to the C-130J air lifter. Multiple highlights were achieved in the quarter with delivery of the 25th -- 2500 aircraft and receipt of the multiyear 2 contract that extends the production line into late 2019. This contract was a portion of the $26 billion in total new contract awards we secured in the quarter and enabled achievement of a strong book-to-bill ratio for the full year of 2015. We also made progress on growing our international sales content, which grew 6% above prior year levels and expanding the international sales content to 21% of total corporate sales. 
I'll close by stating that 2015 was an exceptional year for our corporation, and we implemented bold strategic actions to better position the business for operational and financial success. We secured record new business awards and cash generation, both essential components of future corporate success and value creation. 
Looking forward, I am enthusiastic about the future contributions we can provide to customers and stockholders with our enhanced corporate posture. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2016 financial guidance, and then we'll open up the line for questions."
285827,321233745,920878,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our next release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and a review of our results for the year. Sales",1636,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our next release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and a review of our results for the year. Sales for the year were $46.1 billion, ahead of our expectations from when we spoke in the third quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected, ending the year at 11.9%, and this enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $11.46 for the year. Cash from operations for the year was our highest ever at $5.1 billion. We returned $5 billion of cash to our stockholders in the year, led by repurchasing 15.2 million shares for $3.1 billion. And we grew our backlog significantly to almost $100 billion with the integration of Sikorsky into the corporation. We'll cover all these items in more detail in the coming charge an exceptional year in 2015. 
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales were about a $0.5 billion higher this year than last year including the addition of about $400 million of sales from Sikorsky for the short period after the close in early November. Even without the Sikorsky sales, we were slightly higher than last year's results and better than we had expected when we spoke in October as we had higher volume in several business areas as we closed the year. Earnings per share were $0.25 higher than last year at $11.46 for the full year and were also higher than the guidance we provided in October, driven by the increased sales volume and improve performance. 
On Chart 5, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 15.2 million shares in 2015, nearly 4 million shares more than in 2014, and that brought our shares outstanding at year-end to 305 million shares. This positions us well to achieve our goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. At the end of 2015, we have around 4 million unexercised options, which is a significantly lower level than we had several years ago. And the announced transaction with Leidos creates the potential to reduce share count by up to 15 million shares upon closure later this year. 
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash return to stockholders in 2015. Our cash from operations, as we said earlier, was $5.1 billion. And with about $900 million in capital expenditures on the year, we had $4.2 billion of free cash flow. With $1.9 billion in dividends along with the $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we returned $5 billion to our stockholders in 2015, the highest amount in our history, and this represents 120% of our free cash flow for the year. 
Chart 7 shows our backlog levels of the last 5 years. 2015 represents the fifth consecutive year that we've ended the year with more than $80 billion in backlog. Without the addition of Sikorsky's backlog, 2015 would have still represented the highest backlog level in our history at more than $84 billion. And with Sikorsky, our backlog is nearly $100 billion. 
On Chart 8, we discuss our outlook for 2016. We are expecting sales to be in the range of $49.5 billion to $51 billion, and this range includes the realigned IS&GS business area for the entire year as it is our practice not to incorporate adjustments such as our RMT transaction until they've been consummated. I'll provide more color on the sales ranges by business area in a couple of charts. 
Our outlook for segment operating profit is a range of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000, and I'll also show you the range by business area in a couple of charts. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is higher than we provided in the October call, and I'll discuss the reasons behind the increase in the next chart. We expect our earnings per share will be between $11.45 and $11.75 for the full year. And our outlook from cash from operations is strong again this year at $5.3 billion, up from the $5 billion [ph] we projected in the October call. 
Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of the expected 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment that we discussed in October compared with our current guidance. We had an actuarial update to the mortality our longevity assumptions that reduced our longevity estimates and results in a lower FAS expense and increased the FAS/CAS benefit by $125 million. Our prior assessment assumes a discount rate of 4.25 -- our prior assumes -- excuse me, discount rate of 4.25% increased at year end to 4.375%, which resulted in a $60 million improvement in the FAS/CAS benefit. The actual return on our pension assets was a negative 2% rather than the 0 return we expected in October, which resulted in a $40 million reduction in the benefit. And with some minor adjustments, which improved $20 million, we increased the FAS/CAS benefit for 2016 by $165 million to $975 million in total. 
Chart 10 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area for the year. In Aeronautics we adjusted since we spoke in October to incorporate the addition of Sikorsky, the realignment of the IS&GS business or in the case of MST, both. Overall, sales, excluding Sikorsky, will be roughly comparable to our 2000 -- to our level in 2015, although 2015 finished stronger than we had expected. And our segment operating profit and margin, before the incorporation of Sikorsky, is right in line with where we expected it to be when we spoke in October. I want to draw your attention to MST and the incorporation of Sikorsky into that business area as we made some significant adjustments to account for purchase accounting and integration, which we'll discuss more in the next page. 
Chart 11 captures the adjustments made to Sikorsky outlook for both sales and profit. Beginning with purchase accounting, the largest impact to profit is the incorporation of the noncash intangible amortization associated with the acquisition, which lowers profit by approximately $230 million based on current projections, which can change as we finalize our purchase accounting analysis. And we impacted both sales and profit by what are called customer inventory rights. Essentially, this recognizes the portion of government contracts that were partially completed by Sikorsky before our purchase and for which Lockheed Martin can only recognize the sales and profit that has occurred since our ownership. This adjustment reduced the sales by $400 million and profit by $30 million and is weighted much more heavily in the first part of the year, as you would imagine. You will notice the similar reduction in 2015 describing our earnings release. Costs to integrate Sikorsky into the corporation, along with the remaining cost to complete the restructuring actions announced by Sikorsky last year before our purchase amount to another $115 million reduction in profit this year. All told, these adjustments reduced sales by around $400 million and profit by $375 million in 2016. 
If you'll turn to Chart 12, we'll discuss the impacts of the transaction with Leidos that was announced this morning. Stockholders of Lockheed Martin will receive $5 billion of value for our contributed assets in a very tax efficient structure. Just to put some sizing to the tax benefits, we would agree to sell the business for almost $7.7 billion to have created the same after-tax value as the transaction we announced. At current valuations, we would receive the $5 billion in the form of $3.2 billion in equity from Leidos for 50.5% ownership in the newly formed company and $1.8 billion from a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The $1.8 billion special cash payment is fixed -- is a fixed amount through closing, while the equity amount will vary with changes in the value of Leidos' shares until closing. Because of it is structured as a stock split off, an additional benefit we would anticipate is a reduction in our share count of up to 15 million shares. In addition, Lockheed Martin stockholders who choose to participate in the split will also benefit from the synergies created by the new company, which are expected to be $120 million a year at steady-state. And because this is anticipated to be a stock split off, we expect to have a significant book gain of more than $1.5 billion at closure. 
On Chart 13, we showed the expected high level impact by some of our future financial measures after the IS&GS transaction is complete compared to what those results would have otherwise been had we retained the IS&GS business. We expect our sales growth rate will be higher under the new structure. GAAP earnings per share should be neutral to slightly positive as the share count reduction from the transaction more than offsets the lost operating profit from IS&GS. Cash from operations is also expected to be higher as the increase in cash generation from Sikorsky offset the loss cash generated by IS&GS. Return and invested capital should be higher at the transaction as a result of using the proceeds to reduce our invested capital base, and we expect shares outstanding to be lower because of a stock split-off arrangement. And at the end of the day, we think the organization better positions the company for long-term growth. 
Finally, on Chart 14, we have our summary. 2015 really was an exceptional performance year, particularly given the strategic actions we undertook. We finished the year strong, and we settled a very solid foundation for 2016. We continue to make cash deployment actions with our stockholders in mind, and we believe that our portfolio shaping actions have us well positioned for future value creation. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?"

Thanks for the question, Howard. So you hit that this is a very complicated quarter and a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all of moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring event at the end of the last year. You saw that",325,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Howard. So you hit that this is a very complicated quarter and a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all of moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring event at the end of the last year. You saw that. This is in our MST business. It amounts about $67 million. Think of this as sort of rightsizing that business post the integration of Sikorsky into MST. I also mentioned in the chart that shows the adjustments to Sikorsky that we're seeing some carryover what I would call restructuring charges from the actions that were taken that are Sikorsky in 2015 before our ownership that are somewhat carrying over into 2016. Those don't quite offset each other, but it's pretty close. As you said, we have the R&D tax credit that occurred at the end of 2015, which benefited us. It wasn't in our outlook until it literally happened in the month of December. So good news about that as that's now becoming permanent going forward. So because it is permanent, we also assumed that in our 2016 outlook. We had some deal closure costs that also had 2015. Think of that as about roughly $0.09 a share or so, I think about $45 million collectively for those sort of transaction cost. And then 2016 is where it gets complicated. We've got, as I said, a purchase accounting adjustments for Sikorsky, the integration in cost for Sikorsky. So just a lot of moving pieces there. It's also important to note that as a result of the debt deal that we did to acquire Sikorsky, interest expense is somewhere in the magnitude of about $230 million or thereabouts, higher than it was in 2015. So I'd hit -- I think, most of sort of things that are changing that are between the year, Howard, they're probably couple that are left out, but I think those are the drivers."

Let's see, where should I begin?

So all good questions, Hunter. Let's see, where should I begin? So Sikorsky, because of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don't think a lot of people necessarily had in there that's about a $400 million reduction for sales that occurred before our ownership, if you will, that are carrying over into 2016, but that brings the sales down and profit down from what it otherwise could have been. You should think of Sikorsky as being roughly the same size as the realigned IS&GS. They're kind of both in the $5 billion range if you want to put it in that perspective. I think you asked about, sort of apples-to-apples margins from MST before considering Sikorsky. That's a little bit hard to do because as you recall -- and we talked about this in the opening remarks, the realignment of IS&GS really affects 4 of the 5 business areas. So if you put it just on the basis of what I'd call the heritage MST business, before the incorporation of the portion of IS&GS that's going into and starting this year, its margins are actually fairly comparable to what they were in 2015, the IS&GS business. So think of this is the seat for ISR business at this previously with an IS&GS. That business coming into MST is a little bit of a margin headwind. So it brings it down about a little bit. And then I think you talked about the prospects for Sikorsky going forward. I think maybe the easiest way to talk about this -- and I should say before I talk about the prospects going forward, we try to capture all this. I know there's a lot better just said but I think we provide some pretty good insight in our schedules in the press release to show the realignment to capture all the pieces are just walk through, if it's not clear by what I just said. Sikorsky -- I think the biggest change that we're seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes in sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today. So I think I'd said at the July call that OEM sales for commercial had peaked at about roughly at $1.5 billion. This does not include the aftermarket sales, which I'll portion of that aside year but just the pure sales of about $1.5 billion in 2014. And what I said at the time we thought, because of the rolling as precious, we thought 2016 would probably be half that number. As it turns out, our current outlook is probably half of that number. So think of that as roughly $375 million or so of commercial Hilo sales in the year 2016, which -- and think of that also as being the highest margin products within the IS&GS portfolio set, some of the pressure we're seeing. On the flip side, Hunter, without tell you is we are already seeing the benefits of some the combination particularly on the international military side. And Marillyn talked about some of that in our opening remarks. And what I would characterize the paramilitary side. So think of that as things like Coast Guard, search and rescue and border patrol fleets. And those are actually, we think, upside to the plan an upside to the business case, at least as we initially looked at that. But those prospects won't impact 2016 and won't frankly have much impact even in 2017 if we are successful in closing on those. And then the last thing I'd close with, Hunter, is the cash prospects going forward, we do expect to be much improved in terms of the current level of cash generated by Sikorsky going forward over the next 2 [ph] years, and you should think of that primarily center transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore lower cash and some different terms associated with that, to peer production [indiscernible] that should be sort of normal cash generating business just like they would be within Lockheed Martin. Hope that covers the for you there, Hunter."

But I'm not sure I'm that good at predicting the future, but we do think we still have entitlement there. So hopefully that helps with that, question. On the C-130 multiyear, thanks for the comment relative to getting that done and it's good to have that for the stretch out to 2019 now. You asked about do we have the same margin opportunity? I've described this in other forums where you should think of 2 years a sort of starting off at a lower initial profit recording rate than probably where we ended the current or older multiyear and contracts on the C-130 program. So you'll see our say optically lower margins from a GAAP perspective because we're starting that program lower. Bed at end of the day, and sort of from an economic value perspective, we would expect a current multiyear program to have very similar economics and especially similar cash flows even from day 1 as the previous programs that we completed. So while a little bit of near-term, I'll say EPS and margin pressure relative to what we had done on years past with prior C-130 deliveries, we think at the end of the day, the economics for those 2 programs are comparable."

So you should think of the discussion and what was talked about from the Leidos point of view as this is more of an EBITDA comparison then the EBIT numbers, the segment EBIT actually that we're showing for IS&GS, so your numbers are right, as usual. Think of it is about $360 million of segment EBIT from IS&GS this year. I mean the first adjustment that's made to that to get the EBITDA is obviously take up the depreciation, amortization. You should think of as being collectively about $80 million because we have some level of depreciation from the capital assets there, but we also have amortization from previous acquisitions within IS&GS. And so that gets to about $440 million or so. The total EBITDA for this business going into Leidos, you should think of it as about in the $500 million-ish range. And the delta to go from what I just described, from the originally EBITDA, EBIT -- segment EBIT, plus the depreciation and amortization, there's a lot of moving pieces to get that up up, but a bigger single one is the elimination of the pension costs. We are retaining those assets and liabilities and therefore, that cost reduction is what the other benefit is to get to roughly the $0.5 billion of EBITDA for IS&GS in the new structure."

We're seeing some benefits actually from the cargo -- the CRS, I've lost track with the acronym stands for, the currently supplier or cargo resupply mission where 2 of the 3 vehicles are currently slated to be launched by Atlas vehicles. So that's helping us. We have to kind of bridge, we think, to get to the ability to develop an American engine, if you will, to replace the RD 180. Right now, it is our expectation that will require contributions from the parents. But that's something that we've got a work out, sort of between our partner and the U.S. government to ensure that.

I had said in either the July and October call, we thought we could have about $150 million sort of steady state run rate. That occurs probably in the 2018 time frame. Again, we're seeing a lot of the integration cost occurring in 2016 that's dampening that a bit. But the run rate is still what we expect. And as I've said and I think on previous calls, you would expect sort of the retained portion of that run rate to go down a little bit over time as we give some portion of that back to our U.S. government on the contracts.

Relative to -- I think you asked about maybe 3 of the business areas: MST, Missiles and Fire Control's and space systems for what's going on in 2016 maybe compared to 2015. I talked a little bit about this in the October call, and really nothing has changed other than we've again -- we move pieces around because of the realignment of IS&GS. But in a very high level, you should think about the Missiles and Fire Control being lower than 2015. Again, we've realigned that business to remove him in the tech service business that was there, just sort of the core heritage Missiles and Fire Control is slower. Again, because we expect lower, with our describe as in theater demand for programs like the GMLRS, the attack missile, Javelins of the fire control portals and you should think of that as again this is reflecting a reduction in funding for some of that in-theater activity that is very quick turn the system is mix or even were talking about the prepayment accounts going up, we don't expect that offset in 2164 Missiles and Fire Control. MST, the current outlook really makes kind for a high comparison. So it's got Sikorsky for the full year in 2016 versus less than 2 months in 2015. The heritage, thing you talked about this earlier prepared pajamas the business has slight growth. 16 over '15 which affects the continue to ramp up as of the programs that were run in 2015. For that matter, 2014. And the realigned C-4 ISR business that are talked about earlier from IS&GS is expected to have sales reductions from the 2015 level for that business that are probably comparable to what is currently shown for the realigned IS&GS business in total. So that's sort of what's bringing the combined, if you will, MST without Sikorsky to the levels that we're seeing. And then Space Systems. Space Systems is sort of the good news-badness. A little bit lower funding for things like Orien and the plate ballistic missile programs. But the main reason is because of the lower government satellites activity in 2016 and 2015. That's a good news story because that says each incremental satellite that we're selling to the U.S. government is costing less than the previous one. We're doing about the same volume in terms of numbers of satellites, but our programs to reduce costs are paying off in each one mac a subsequently cheap, and that's what we're seeing women Space Systems."

We continue to have growing international interest for our programs, particularly in the area of missile defense. And in the Middle East and Asia Pacific and even in Europe where Germany has selected the access their missile defense capability and Aegis Ashore. So that is an expanding demand. We continue to see that. We had some of the current conflict in the Middle East, we're seeing some of our ammunitions and things of that nature that there's a continuing desire for our targeting pods and other things that they needed in the current conflict. The F-35, on the international front, it will continue to ramp up. There's a strong interest, growth in the sales, in fact, in the next 5 years. About 50% of the orders will come from international marketplace. And then I know that there's a lot of interest in terms of oil prices. We're not seeing a lot of pullback on expenditures national security. Certainly, oil prices affect our sale of commercial rotary wing but in the balance of our business, when it does put some pressure on budgets and the countries that are buying national security assets and things that they need to protect their citizens, the choices that they're making are cutting other air so that they can protect the citizens and so we're not seeing a big damper and that. There may be some things that will slip out a little bit or they might reduce the volume of the near term but they still going to by the products are capabilities and technologies they need to enable them to protect their citizens and to deal with their security issues."

Second one is space. Also down pretty -- about have that number as well. And that's just the timing of orders. That's a very weird orders in the past few years that are playing up the sales, and we don't have quite the size, including the Orion order a few years back. And we're not seeing those orders replicated, but they are translating into sales as we speak here. The big orders we're watching this year, not a lot of -- frankly, not a lot of the large competitive orders that we're chasing this year. I think the biggest orders we're looking for are the sort of the follow-on F-35 orders. In particular, lot 10 and finalization of lot 9 a lot of the ancillary contracts that go with both of those LRIP. So that's the biggest chunk of it. The biggest single international order we're watching probably is a tad order with and we have other air missile defense programs that are scattered throughout the region, but not nearly the same size as for Simeon Cutter. But that's the driver of the biggest international orders prospects as we see 2016."

Aeronautics margin, as I said on the October call, there's really 2 reasons for that. They're driving them below 2015. The first one being -- as I call the dilutive effect of the F-35 program, even though the margins in F-35 are increasing year-over-year, they're still lower than the overall composite rate for aeronautics, and that's being in the rate down slightly. The better reason primarily was the C-130 impact that I think which was talking about relative to the sort of the conversion of older C-130 contracts and out looking sales under a new multiyear work again, economically I don't see a lot of difference between the 2. But from a sort of a GAAP reporting perspective, we would expect to have sort of a lower starting margin on the new multiyear then the ending margin on the previously negotiated C-130 contracts. And those 2 are what are kind of bringing down the margins of aeronautics in '16 compared '15. I do think -- I think you asked about, what's the prospects going forward? I think 2016 is sort of the bottom point, if that make sense relative to the margins of aeronautics. And we would expect to see slow improvements going forward every year, primarily as we see the sort of getting to, I'll say, an ordinary production program on the F-35 program starts to take effect as well as the inevitable increases on C-130 because we're starting off at a lower booking rate than we are right now. 2000 -- I think you asked about 2017 FAS/CAS. I would expect it to be and look out -- I always hesitate to look talk about next year. There's so many moving pieces in FAS/CAS if we were sort of current course and speed is the way like to describe what were about it. We're about $975 million today. It's probably in the $450 million higher next year, if we were to strike a line today. But obviously, a lot of things can change between now and the end of the year."

Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. As today's release illustrates, we completed another quarter of solid operational accomplishments, while exceeding all of our full year financial goals, and I couldn't be more proud of our team. They remain focused on mission success for our customers and financial results for stockholders while also supporting extensive portfolio reshaping actions. 
We have a number of significant events to discuss today. In addition to reviewing our financial and operational results, I want to provide an update on the FY '16 DoD budget and a discussion of 2 completed strategic actions: the closure of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft; and our decision to separate and combine our Information Systems & Global Solutions business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. 
Financially, 2015 was an exceptional year, with achievement of multiple, new high watermarks for the corporation. I was especially pleased to see the broad-based domestic and international customer support for our portfolio of products. This support resulted in our achieving a record level of backlog of nearly $100 billion. Excluding the acquired Sikorsky backlog, the rest of our portfolio achieved $84 billion, significantly surpassing the $80 billion goal we outlined at the beginning of 2015. Our backlog has us positioned to deliver expanding sales levels and financial results as we move forward in 2016 and beyond. 
A second area where we achieved another high watermark was the generation of over $5 billion in cash from operations, achieving a record annual level for the corporation in this critically important area. This cash flow is only achieved through the daily efforts and focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers. The robust cash generation also enabled us to expand our cash return to stockholders to a record annual level of $5 billion, achieved through our industry-leading dividend payout level and ongoing share repurchase activity. 
For 2015, share repurchases reduced the year-end outstanding share count to approximately 305 million shares. We are well on our way to achieve or exceed our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017. Overall, the corporation continue to excel in the attributes we most value, providing critical solutions to customer and returning value to stockholders. 
Looking beyond 2015, our 2016 guidance outlined today results in increased sales, earnings per share and growing cash from operations. The guidance includes the Sikorsky financials from the recently completed acquisition and also reflects the realignment of our information technology and Technical Services businesses. The guidance also assumes continuation of the results for the full year of 2016 from the Information Systems and Global Solutions business identified in our strategic review. We will adjust our financial outlook later this year when the disposition of IS&GS is completed. Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. 
I'd like to briefly discuss the defense budget. Since we spoke last quarter, significant uncertainty was removed with the successful completion of a bipartisan agreement of the FY '16-based DoD budget. The new budget reflects an annual increase of approximately $25 billion, above the previously planned budget level, and is also the first increase in annual DoD budget since 2012. The budget is a recognition of increasing global security requirements and the need to allocate additional fiscal resources to respond to the threat environment. A key element in the increased DoD budget is a double-digit annual percentage increase in the investment accounts that fund new equipment procurement and research development -- research and development activities. This strong funding increase will be used to address the acute need to replace aging equipment, while ensuring development of key new technologies to respond to evolving security requirements facing domestic and international customers. As part of the budget, we were pleased to see 11 additional F-35 aircraft added in the FY '16 omnibus. This marks the first time in the history of the F-35 program that aircraft were added to the baseline request, demonstrating strong support for our largest program. We believe our portfolio of products and new technologies will line up very well with essential recapitalization actions in the areas of ballistic missile defense, tactical missiles and rotary aircraft. 
I'd like to now turn to the 2 strategic actions we announced back in July. First, we were proud to welcome the Sikorsky team to Lockheed Martin with the successful closure of their acquisition on November 6. Together, we will build upon a legacy of innovation and performance that has shaped the history of aviation for more than a century. This action advances our commitment to provide customers with affordable mission-ready solutions in rotary aircraft. Their inclusion will enable us to move forward with our goal to expand our business into the strategically important areas of helicopter production and sustainment. Since the transaction closure, the combined team at Mission Systems and Training have hit the ground running. We are already seeing accelerated customer interest in both military and search and rescue opportunities emerging in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. 
It is increasingly clear that we will be better together as we leverage our combined scale and serve as a technology leader at the forefront of vertical lift. I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term value creation of this business as we move forward in providing essential products and solutions to customers around the world. 
Turning to our second strategic item. As announced earlier today, we completed the review of our Information Systems & Global Solutions businesses. That review culminated in our decision to separate and combine our IS&GS business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We are excited about this path forward and believe this is the best fit strategically and will be beneficial to the shareholders of both corporations. This transaction is an important milestone in the portfolio-shaping strategy we announced last July and allows us to focus on our core business in aerospace and defense. 
The combination of a proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a more diversified competitor positioned for growth and future success, while unlocking value for our stockholders. This agreement aligns the IS&GS business with an industry leader in government IT and technical services and will create an enterprise capable of providing unparalleled solutions in industries ranging from national security to health and life sciences. The complementary portfolios of both companies will create a diversified and balanced business mix with expanded domain expertise, increased advantages of scale efficiencies and synergy opportunities. These benefits will be the foundation to create value for stockholders, customers and employees. 
One of the important goals in our strategic evaluation of the business was to ensure that the final decision provides a good cultural fit and home for IS&GS employees. It is my belief that employee morale and opportunities for their growth are key elements in the future success of every enterprise. Over the last few months, during our many interactions with Leidos, we have come to know their management and culture, and we are confident that this combination fully satisfies our employee goal. Bruce will speak more about the financial aspects of the transaction and the projected timeline for closure in his remarks. 
I'd like to end my remarks with a few key operational highlights in the fourth quarter that enabled the corporation to finish the year on a very strong note. Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we achieved our full year delivery goal of 45 aircraft to domestic and international customers. This delivery level reflects our continuing ramp-up in production on the program and is a 25% increase above prior-year deliveries. For 2016, we are expecting additional production expansion with planned deliveries increasing to 53 aircraft. The team also continued to retire key tests on the F-35 development program as we look forward to completing remaining tests in 2016 as the development phase winds down. 
Switching to the C-130J air lifter. Multiple highlights were achieved in the quarter with delivery of the 25th -- 2,500th aircraft and receipt of the multiyear contract that extends the production line into late 2019. This contract was a portion of the $26 billion in total new contract awards we secured in the quarter and enabled achievement of a strong book-to-bill ratio for the full year of 2015. We also made progress on growing our international sales content, which grew 6% above prior year levels and expanding the international sales content to 21% of total corporate sales. 
I'll close by stating that 2015 was an exceptional year for our corporation, and we implemented bold strategic actions to better position the business for operational and financial success. We secured record new business awards and cash generation, both essential components to future corporate success and value creation. 
Looking forward, I'm enthusiastic about the future contributions we can provide to customers and stockholders with our enhanced corporate posture. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2016 financial guidance, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,321233745,920998,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year.",1636,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales for the year were $46.1 billion, ahead of our expectations from when we spoke in the third quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected, ending the year at 11.9%, and this enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $11.46 for the year. Cash from operations for the year was our highest ever at $5.1 billion. We returned $5 billion of cash to our stockholders in the year, led by repurchasing 15.2 million shares for $3.1 billion. And we grew our backlog significantly to almost $100 billion with the integration of Sikorsky into the corporation. We'll cover all these items in more detail in the coming chart for it was an exceptional year in 2015. 
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales were about $0.5 billion higher this year than last year, including the addition of about $400 million of sales from Sikorsky for the short period after the close in early November. Even without the Sikorsky sales, we were slightly higher than last year's results and better than we had expected when we spoke in October, as we had higher volume in several business areas as we closed the year. Earnings per share were $0.25 higher than last year at $11.46 for the full year and were also higher than the guidance we provided in October, driven by the increased sales volume and improved performance. 
On Chart 5, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 15.2 million shares in 2015, nearly 4 million shares more than in 2014, and that brought our shares outstanding at year-end to 305 million shares. This positions us well to achieve our goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. At the end of 2015, we have around 4 million unexercised options, which is a significantly lower level than we had several years ago. And the announced transaction with Leidos creates the potential to reduce share count by up to 15 million shares upon closure later this year. 
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash return to stockholders in 2015. Our cash from operations, as we said earlier, was $5.1 billion. And with about $900 million in capital expenditures on the year, we had $4.2 billion of free cash flow. With $1.9 billion in dividends, along with the $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we returned $5 billion to our stockholders in 2015, the highest amount in our history, and this represents 120% of our free cash flow for the year. 
Chart 7 shows our backlog levels over the last 5 years. 2015 represents the fifth consecutive year that we've ended the year with more than $80 billion in backlog. Without the addition of Sikorsky's backlog, 2015 would have still represented the highest backlog level in our history at more than $84 billion. And with Sikorsky, our backlog is nearly $100 billion. 
On Chart 8, we discuss our outlook for 2016. We're expecting sales to be in the range of $49.5 billion to $51 billion, and this range includes the realigned IS&GS business area for the entire year as it is our practice not to incorporate adjustments such as our RMT transaction until they've been consummated. I'll provide more color on the sales ranges by business area in a couple of charts. 
Our outlook for segment operating profit is a range of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000, and I'll also show you the range by business area in a couple of charts. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is higher than we provided on the October call, and I'll discuss the reasons behind the increase on the next chart. We expect our earnings per share will be between $11.45 and $11.75 for the year. And our outlook from cash from operations is strong again this year at $5.3 billion, up from the $5 billion we projected in the October call. 
Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of the expected 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment that we discussed in October compared with our current guidance. We had an actuarial update to the mortality or longevity assumptions that reduced our longevity estimates and results in a lower FAS expense and increased the FAS/CAS benefit by $125 million. Our prior assessment assumes a discount rate of 4.25 -- our prior assumed, excuse me, discount rate of 4.25% increased at year end to 4.375%, which resulted in a $60 million improvement in the FAS/CAS benefit. The actual return on our pension assets was a negative 2% rather than the 0 return we expected in October, which resulted in a $40 million reduction in the benefit. And with some minor adjustments, which improved $20 million, we increased the FAS/CAS benefit for 2016 by $165 million to $975 million in total. 
Chart 10 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area for the year. And all but Aeronautics have been adjusted since we spoke in October to incorporate the addition of Sikorsky, the realignment of the IS&GS business, or in the case of MST, both. Overall, sales, excluding Sikorsky, will be roughly comparable to our 2000 -- to our level in 2015, although 2015 finished stronger than we had expected. And our segment operating profit and margin before the incorporation of Sikorsky is right in line with where we expected it to be when we spoke in October. 
I want to draw your attention to MST and the incorporation of Sikorsky into that business area as we've made some significant adjustments to account for purchase accounting and integration, which we'll discuss more on the next page. 
Chart 11 captures the adjustments made to Sikorsky outlook for both sales and profit. Beginning with purchase accounting, the largest impact to profit is the incorporation of the noncash intangible amortization associated with the acquisition, which lowers profit by approximately $230 million based on current projections, which can change as we finalize our purchase accounting analysis. And we impacted both sales and profit by what are called customer inventory rights. Essentially, this recognizes the portion of government contracts that were partially completed by Sikorsky before our purchase and for which Lockheed Martin can only recognize the sales and profit that has occurred since our ownership. This adjustment reduced the sales by $400 million and profit by $30 million and is weighted much more heavily in the first part of the year, as you would imagine. You will notice a similar sales reduction in 2015 described in our earnings release. Costs to integrate Sikorsky into the corporation, along with the remaining cost to complete the restructuring actions announced by Sikorsky last year before our purchase amount to another $115 million reduction in profit this year. All told, these adjustments reduce sales by around $400 million and profit by $375 million in 2016. 
If you'll turn to Chart 12, we'll discuss the impacts of the transaction with Leidos that was announced this morning. Stockholders of Lockheed Martin will receive $5 billion of value for our contributed assets in a very tax-efficient structure. Just to put some sizing to the tax benefits, we would have needed to sell the business for almost $7.7 billion to have created the same after-tax value as the transaction we announced. At current valuations, we would receive the $5 billion in the form of $3.2 billion in equity from Leidos for 50.5% ownership in the newly formed company and $1.8 billion from a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The $1.8 billion special cash payment is fixed -- is a fixed amount through closing, while the equity amount will vary with changes in the value of Leidos' shares until closing. Because this is structured as a stock split off, an additional benefit, we would anticipate, is a reduction in our share count of up to 15 million shares. In addition, Lockheed Martin stockholders who choose to participate in the split will also benefit from the synergies created by the new company, which are expected to be $120 million a year at steady-state. And because this is anticipated to be a stock split off, we expect to have a significant book gain of more than $1.5 billion at closure. 
On Chart 13, we showed the expected high level impact of some of our future financial measures after the IS&GS transaction is complete compared to what those results would have otherwise been had we retained the IS&GS business. We expect our sales growth rate will be higher under the new structure. GAAP earnings per share should be neutral to slightly positive as the share count reduction from the transaction more than offsets the lost operating profit from IS&GS. Cash from operations is also expected to be higher as the increase in cash generation from Sikorsky offsets the loss cash generated by IS&GS. Return on invested capital should be higher after transaction as a result of using the proceeds to reduce our invested capital base, and we expect shares outstanding to be lower because of the stock split-off arrangement. And at the end of the day, we think the new organization better positions the company for long-term growth. 
Finally, on Chart 14, we have our summary. 2015 really was an exceptional performance year, particularly given the strategic actions we undertook. We finished the year strong, and we set a very solid foundation for 2016. We continue to make cash deployment actions with our stockholders in mind, and we believe that our portfolio-shaping actions have us well-positioned for future value creation. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?"

We did have a restructuring event at the end of last year. You",330,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Howard. So you hit that there is -- this is a very complicated quarter and a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all the moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring event at the end of last year. You saw that. This is in our MST business. It amounts to about $67 million. Think of this as sort of rightsizing that business post the integration of Sikorsky into MST. I also mentioned in the chart that shows the adjustments to Sikorsky that we're seeing some carryover what I would call restructuring charges from the actions that were taken that are Sikorsky in 2015 before our ownership that are somewhat carrying over into 2016. Those don't quite offset each other, but it's pretty close. As you said, we had the R&D tax credit that occurred at the end of 2015, which benefited us. It wasn't in our outlook until it literally happened in the month of December. The good news about that is that's now becoming permanent going forward, so because it is permanent, we've also assumed that in our 2016 outlook. We had some deal closure costs that also hit 2015, think about it as about roughly $0.09 a share or so, I think about $45 million collectively for those sort of transaction cost. And then, 2016 is where it gets complicated. We've got, as I said, the purchase accounting adjustments for Sikorsky, the integration in cost for Sikorsky. So just a lot of moving pieces there. It's also important to note that as a result of the debt deal that we did to acquire Sikorsky, interest expense is somewhere on the magnitude of about $230 million or thereabouts, higher than it was in 2015. So I've hit, I think, most of the sort of the things are changing that are between the years, Howard, there are probably a couple I left off, but I think those are the big drivers."

Let's see, where should I begin? So Sikorsky, because of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don't think a lot of people necessarily had in their head that there's about a $400 mill",711,"Yes. So all good questions, Hunter. Let's see, where should I begin? So Sikorsky, because of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don't think a lot of people necessarily had in their head that there's about a $400 million reduction for sales that occurred before our ownership, if you will, that are carrying over into 2016, but that brings the sales down and profit down from what it otherwise could have been. You should think of Sikorsky as being roughly the same size as the realigned IS&GS. They're kind of both in the $5 billion range, if you want to put it in that perspective. I think, you asked about sort of apples-to-apples margins from MST before considering Sikorsky. That's a little bit hard to do because as you recall, and we talked about this in the opening remarks, the realignment of IS&GS really affects 4 of the 5 business areas. So if you put it just on the basis of what I'd call the heritage MST business before the incorporation of the portion of IS&GS that's going into it starting this year, its margins are actually fairly comparable to what they were in 2015, the IS&GS business. So think of this as the seat for ISR business that was previously within IS&GS. That business coming into MST is a little bit of a margin headwind, so it brings it down a little bit. And then, I think, you talked about the prospects for Sikorsky going forward. I think, maybe the easiest way to talk about this, and I should say before I talk about the prospects going forward, we try to capture all this. I know there's a lot that I just said, but I think we provide some pretty good insight in our schedules in the press release to show the realignment to capture all the pieces I just walked through, if that's not clear by what I just said. Sikorsky -- I think, the biggest change that we're seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes in sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today. So I think I had said at the July call that OEM sales for commercial helos had peaked at about roughly $1.5 billion. This doesn't include the aftermarket sales, which I'll portion off to the side here, but just the pure helo sales of about $1.5 billion in 2014. And what I said at the time was, we thought, because of the oil and gas pressures, we thought 2016 would probably be half that number. As it turns out, our current outlook is probably half of that number. So think of that as roughly $375 million or so of commercial helo sales in the year 2016, which -- and think of that also as being the highest margin products within the IS&GS portfolio set, some of the pressure that we're seeing. On the flip side, Hunter, what I'll tell you is we're already seeing the benefits of some of the combination, particularly on the international military side, and Marillyn talked about some of that in her opening remarks, and what I would characterize as sort of the paramilitary side. So think of that as things like Coast Guard, search and rescue and border patrol fleets. And those are actually, we think, upside to the plan, an upside to the business case, at least as we initially looked at that. But those prospects won't impact 2016 and won't frankly have much impact even in 2017 if we are successful in closing on those. And then, the last thing I'd close with, Hunter, is the cash prospects going forward, we do expect to be much improved in terms of the current level of cash generated by Sikorsky going forward over the next few years, and you should think of that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore lower cash and some different terms associated with that to peer production programs that should be sort of normal cash-generating business, just like they would be within Lockheed Martin. Hopefully, that covers the waterfront for you there, Hunter."

I'd love to say it's going to happen this year, but I'm not sure I'm that good at predicting the future, but we do think we still have entitlement there. So hopefully, that helps with that question. On the C-130 multiyear, thanks for the comment relative to getting that done and it's good to have that program stretched out to 2019 now. You asked about do we have the same margin opportunity? I've described this in other forums where you should think of new multi-years as sort of starting off at a lower initial profit recording rate than probably where we ended the current or older multiyear and contracts on the C-130 program. So we'll see some, I'll say, optically lower margins from a GAAP perspective because we're starting that program lower, but at end of the day, and sort of from an economic value perspective, we would expect the current multiyear program to have very similar economics and especially similar cash flows, even from day 1, as the previous programs that we completed. So while a little bit of near-term, I'll say EPS and margin pressure relative to what we have done on years past with prior C-130 deliveries, we think, at the end of the day, the economics for those 2 programs are comparable."

So you should think of the discussion and what was talked about from the Leidos point of view as this is more of an EBITDA comparison than the EBIT numbers, the segment EBIT actually that we're showing for IS&GS, so your numbers are right, as usual. Think of it as about $360 million of segment EBIT from IS&GS this year. I mean, the first adjustment that's made to that to get the EBITDA is obviously take out the depreciation and amortization, you should think of those being collectively about $80 million because we have some level of depreciation from the capital assets there, but we also have the amortization from previous acquisitions within IS&GS. And so that gets you to, what, about $440 million or so. The total EBITDA for this business going into Leidos, you should think of it as about in the $500 million-ish range. And the delta to go from what I just described, from the original EBITDA, EBIT -- segment EBIT, plus the depreciation and amortization, there's a lot of moving pieces to get to the top, but the biggest single one is the elimination of the pension costs. We are retaining those assets and liabilities, and therefore, that cost reduction is what the other benefit is to get to roughly the $0.5 billion of EBITDA for IS&GS in the new structure."

And you should think of that as, again, this is reflecting a reduction in OCO funding for some of that in-theater activity that is very quick turn business to us. So even though we're talking about the procurement accounts going up, we don't expect that to offset in 2016 for Missiles and Fire Control. MST, the current outlook really makes kind for a hard comparison. So it's got Sikorsky for the full year in 2016 versus less than 2 months in 2015. The heritage, I think I talked about this earlier, the heritage MST business has slight growth '16 over '15, which reflects the continuing ramp up of the programs that were won in 2015, for that matter, 2014. And the realigned C-4 ISR business that I've talked about earlier from IS&GS is expected to have sales reductions from the 2015 level for that business that are probably comparable to what is currently shown for the realigned IS&GS business in total. So that's sort of what's bringing the combined, if you will, MST without Sikorsky to the levels that we're seeing. And then, Space Systems. Space Systems is sort of the good news, bad news. A little bit lower funding for things like Orion and the Fleet Ballistic Missile programs, but the main reason is because of the lower government satellites activity in 2016 and 2015. That's a good news story because that says each incremental satellite that we're selling to the U.S. government is costing less than the previous one. We're doing about the same volume in terms of numbers of satellites, but our programs to reduce costs are paying off, and each one is subsequently cheaper, and that's what we're seeing within Space Systems."

And then, in addition to that, that's our customer base. Where we sell Sikorsky is the same customer base where we're selling the balance of our portfolio. It broadens our opportunity, both in the domestic and the international marketplace. It just gives us a broader opportunity to sell into those marketplaces, so I see that as an opportunity. And then, we have excellent expertise in doing business with the Department of Defense and with other governments around the world, and the work that we do in our international business development, what we do what our government affairs here in the U.S. We believe we can that piece of business better by bringing it into Lockheed Martin. It's an area that we bring expertise and capability. And that, again, allows us to do that. Our customer relationships, our understanding of doing business with the U.S. government, our understanding of doing business around the world in -- is what we bring to that. We also, I think, understand government contracting to a great extent and we bring the expertise and our focus to that arena.

And in the Middle East and Asia Pacific and even in Europe where Germany has selected MEADS as their missile defense capability, and Aegis Ashore. So that is an expanding demand. We continue to see that. With some of the current conflict in the Middle East, we're seeing some of our ammunitions and things of that nature that there's a continuing desire for our targeting pods and other things that they need in the current conflict. F-35, on the international front, it will continue to ramp up. There's a strong interest, growth in those sales. In fact, in the next 5 years, about 50% of the orders will come from the international marketplace. And then, I know that there's a lot of interest in terms of oil prices. We're not seeing a lot of pullback on expenditures on national security. Certainly, oil prices affect our sale of commercial rotary wing, but in the balance of our business, while it does put some pressure on budgets in the countries that are buying national security assets and things that they need to protect their citizens, the choices that they're making are cutting in other areas so that they can protect their citizens, and so we're not seeing a big damper on that. There may be some things that will slip out a little bit or they might reduce the volume on the near term but they're still going to buy the products and capabilities and technologies they need to enable them to protect their citizens and to deal with their security issues."

And you should really think of it as kind of primarily from 2 business areas. MST will have -- and when I say down, we're talking probably somewhere less than $5 billion there, maybe $4 billion, and probably half for some of that is MST. The bulk of which of that is for Sikorsky. As you might expect, we're having sales that are coming out of backlog from prior year's orders that are not being replaced because of the -- particularly the commercial business I talked about earlier with new orders. Second one is space. Also down pretty -- about half of that number as well. And that's just the timing of orders. We had some very good orders in the past few years that are playing out to sales, and we don't have quite the size, including the Orion order a few years back, and we're not seeing those orders replicated, they are translating into sales as we speak here. So the big orders we're watching this year, not a lot of -- frankly, not a lot of large, competitive orders that we're chasing this year. I think, the biggest orders we're looking for are the sort of the follow-on F-35 orders. In particular, lot 10 and the finalization of lot 9 and a lot of the ancillary contracts that go with both of those LRIPs. So that's the big chunk of it. The biggest single international order we're watching probably is a fad order with Cutter. And we have other air missile defense programs kind of scattered throughout the region, but not nearly the same size as we're seeing in Cutter, but that's the driver of the biggest international orders prospects as we see 2016."

Aeronautics margin, as I said on the October call, there's really 2 reasons for that, that are driving them below 2015. The first one being, as I call, the dilutive effect of the F-35 program, even though the margins on F-35 are increasing year-over-year, they're still lower than the overall composite rate for aeronautics, and that's bringing the rate down slightly. The other reason primarily was the C-130 impact that, I think, Rich was talking about relative to the sort of the conversion of older C-130 contracts and now booking sales under our new multiyear. Again, economically, I don't see a lot of difference between the 2, but from a sort of a GAAP reporting perspective, we'll expect to have sort of a lower starting margin on the new multiyear than the ending margin on the previously negotiated C-130 contracts. And those 2 are what are kind of bringing down the margins of aeronautics in '16 compared to '15. I do think -- I think, you asked about what's the prospects going forward? I think, 2016 is sort of the bottom point, if that makes sense relative to the margins of aeronautics. And we would expect to see slow improvements going forward every year, primarily as we see the sort of getting to, I'll say, an ordinary production program on the F-35 program starts to take effect as well as the inevitable increases on C-130 because we're starting off at a lower booking rate than we are right now. 2000 -- I think you asked about 2017 FAS/CAS. I would expect it to be -- and look, I always hesitate to look talk about next year, there's so many moving pieces in FAS/CAS that if we were to -- sort of current course and speed is always the way I like to describe it, we're about $975 million today. It's probably in the $450 million higher next year if we were to strike a line today. But obviously, a lot of things can change between now and the end of the year."

          Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. As today's release illustrates, we completed another quarter of solid operational accomplishments, while exceeding all of our full year financial goals, and I couldn't be more proud of our team. They remain focused on mission success for our customers and financial results for stockholders while also supporting extensive portfolio reshaping actions. 
We have a number of significant events to discuss today. In addition to reviewing our financial and operational results, I want to provide an update on the FY '16 DoD budget and a discussion of 2 completed strategic actions: the closure of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft; and our decision to separate and combine our Information Systems & Global Solutions business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. 
Financially, 2015 was an exceptional year, with achievement of multiple, new high-water marks for the corporation. I was especially pleased to see the broad-based domestic and international customer support for our portfolio of products. This support resulted in our achieving a record level of backlog of nearly $100 billion. Excluding the acquired Sikorsky backlog, the rest of our portfolio achieved $84 billion, significantly surpassing the $80 billion goal we outlined at the beginning of 2015. Our backlog has us positioned to deliver expanding sales levels and financial results as we move forward in 2016 and beyond. 
A second area where we achieved another high-water mark was the generation of over $5 billion in cash from operations, achieving a record annual level for the corporation in this critically important area. This cash flow is only achieved through the daily efforts and focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers. The robust cash generation also enabled us to expand our cash returned to stockholders to a record annual level of $5 billion, achieved through our industry-leading dividend payout level and ongoing share repurchase activity. 
For 2015, share repurchases reduced the year-end outstanding share count to approximately 305 million shares. We are well on our way to achieve or exceed our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017. Overall, the corporation continued to excel in the attributes we most value: providing critical solutions to customer and returning value to stockholders. 
Looking beyond 2015, our 2016 guidance outlined today results in increased sales, earnings per share and growing cash from operations. The guidance includes the Sikorsky financials from the recently completed acquisition and also reflects the realignment of our information technology and Technical Services businesses. The guidance also assumes continuation of the results for the full year of 2016 from the Information Systems and Global Solutions business identified in our strategic review. We will adjust our financial outlook later this year when the disposition of IS&GS is completed. Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. 
I'd like to briefly discuss the defense budget. Since we spoke last quarter, significant uncertainty was removed with the successful completion of a bipartisan agreement of the FY '16 base DoD budget. The new budget reflects an annual increase of approximately $25 billion, above the previously planned budget level, and is also the first increase in annual DoD budget since 2012. The budget is a recognition of increasing global security requirements and the need to allocate additional fiscal resources to respond to the threat environment. A key element in the increased DoD budget is a double-digit annual percentage increase in the investment accounts that fund new equipment procurement and research development -- research and development activities. This strong funding increase will be used to address the acute need to replace aging equipment, while ensuring development of key new technologies to respond to evolving security requirements facing domestic and international customers. As part of the budget, we were pleased to see 11 additional F-35 aircraft added in the FY '16 omnibus. This marks the first time in the history of the F-35 program that aircraft were added to the baseline request, demonstrating strong support for our largest program. We believe our portfolio of products and new technologies will line up very well with essential recapitalization actions in the areas of ballistic missile defense, tactical missiles and rotary aircraft. 
I'd like to now turn to the 2 strategic actions we announced back in July. First, we were proud to welcome the Sikorsky team to Lockheed Martin with the successful closure of their acquisition on November 6. Together, we will build upon a legacy of innovation and performance that has shaped the history of aviation for more than a century. This action advances our commitment to provide customers with affordable mission-ready solutions in rotary aircraft. Their inclusion will enable us to move forward with our goal to expand our business into the strategically important areas of helicopter production and sustainment. Since the transaction closure, the combined team at Mission Systems and Training have hit the ground running. We are already seeing accelerated customer interest in both military and search and rescue opportunities emerging in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. 
It is increasingly clear that we will be better together as we leverage our combined scale and serve as a technology leader at the forefront of vertical lift. I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term value creation of this business as we move forward in providing essential products and solutions to customers around the world. 
Turning to our second strategic item. As announced earlier today, we completed the review of our Information Systems & Global Solutions businesses. That review culminated in our decision to separate and combine our IS&GS business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We are excited about this path forward and believe this is the best fit strategically and will be beneficial to the shareholders of both corporations. This transaction is an important milestone in the portfolio-shaping strategy we announced last July and allows us to focus on our core business in aerospace and defense. 
The combination of our proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a more diversified competitor positioned for growth and future success, while unlocking value for our stockholders. This agreement aligns the IS&GS business with an industry leader in government IT and technical services and will create an enterprise capable of providing unparalleled solutions in industries ranging from national security to health and life sciences. The complementary portfolios of both companies will create a diversified and balanced business mix with expanded domain expertise, increased advantages of scale efficiencies and synergy opportunities. These benefits will be the foundation to create value for stockholders, customers and employees. 
One of the important goals in our strategic evaluation of the business was to ensure that the final decision provides a good cultural fit and home for IS&GS employees. It is my belief that employee morale and opportunities for their growth are key elements in the future success of every enterprise. Over the last few months, during our many interactions with Leidos, we have come to know their management and culture, and we are confident that this combination fully satisfies our employee goals. Bruce will speak more about the financial aspects of the transaction and the projected timeline for closure in his remarks. 
I'd like to end my remarks with a few key operational highlights in the fourth quarter that enabled the corporation to finish the year on a very strong note. Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we achieved our full year delivery goal of 45 aircraft to domestic and international customers. This delivery level reflects our continuing ramp-up in production on the program and is a 25% increase above prior-year deliveries. For 2016, we are expecting additional production expansion with planned deliveries increasing to 53 aircraft. The team also continued to retire key tasks on the F-35 development program as we look forward to completing remaining tasks in 2016 as the development phase winds down. 
Switching to the C-130J air lifter. Multiple highlights were achieved in the quarter with delivery of the 25th -- 2,500th aircraft and receipt of the multiyear [indiscernible] contract that extends the production line into late 2019. This contract was a portion of the $26 billion in total new contract awards we secured in the quarter and enabled achievement of a strong book-to-bill ratio for the full year of 2015. We also made progress on growing our international sales content, which grew 6% above prior year levels and expanding the international sales content to 21% of total corporate sales. 
I'll close by stating that 2015 was an exceptional year for our corporation, and we implemented bold strategic actions to better position the business for operational and financial success. We secured record new business awards and cash generation, both essential components to future corporate success and value creation. 
Looking forward, I'm enthusiastic about the future contributions we can provide to customers and stockholders with our enhanced corporate posture. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2016 financial guidance, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,321233745,921088,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year.",1639,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales for the year were $46.1 billion, ahead of our expectations from when we spoke in the third quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected, ending the year at 11.9%, and this enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $11.46 for the year. Cash from operations for the year was our highest ever at $5.1 billion. We returned $5 billion of cash to our stockholders in the year, led by repurchasing 15.2 million shares for $3.1 billion. And we grew our backlog significantly to almost $100 billion with the integration of Sikorsky into the corporation. We'll cover all these items in more detail in the coming charts for what was an exceptional year in 2015. 
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales were about $0.5 billion higher this year than last year, including the addition of about $400 million of sales from Sikorsky for the short period after the close in early November. Even without the Sikorsky sales, we were slightly higher than last year's results and better than we had expected when we spoke in October, as we had higher volume in several business areas as we closed the year. Earnings per share were $0.25 higher than last year at $11.46 for the full year and were also higher than the guidance we provided in October, driven by the increased sales volume and improved performance. 
On Chart 5, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 15.2 million shares in 2015, nearly 4 million shares more than in 2014, and that brought our shares outstanding at year-end to 305 million shares. This positions us well to achieve our goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. At the end of 2015, we have around 4 million unexercised options, which is a significantly lower level than we had several years ago. And the announced transaction with Leidos creates the potential to reduce share count by up to 15 million shares upon closure later this year. 
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash returned to stockholders in 2015. Our cash from operations, as we said earlier, was $5.1 billion. And with about $900 million in capital expenditures in the year, we had $4.2 billion of free cash flow. With $1.9 billion in dividends, along with the $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we returned $5 billion to our stockholders in 2015, the highest amount in our history, and this represents 120% of our free cash flow for the year. 
Chart 7 shows our backlog levels over the last 5 years. 2015 represents the fifth consecutive year that we've ended the year with more than $80 billion in backlog. Without the addition of Sikorsky's backlog, 2015 would have still represented the highest backlog level in our history at more than $84 billion. And with Sikorsky, our backlog is nearly $100 billion. 
On Chart 8, we discuss our outlook for 2016. We're expecting sales to be in the range of $49.5 billion to $51 billion, and this range includes the realigned IS&GS business area for the entire year as it is our practice not to incorporate adjustments such as our RMT transaction until they've been consummated. I'll provide more color on the sales ranges by business area in a couple of charts. 
Our outlook for segment operating profit is a range of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000, and I'll also show you the range by business area in a couple of charts. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is higher than we provided on the October call, and I'll discuss the reasons behind the increase on the next chart. We expect our earnings per share will be between $11.45 and $11.75 for the year. And our outlook from cash from operations is strong again this year at $5.3 billion, up from the $5 billion we projected in the October call. 
Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of the expected 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment that we discussed in October compared with our current guidance. We had an actuarial update to the mortality or longevity assumptions that reduced our longevity estimates and results in a lower FAS expense and increased the FAS/CAS benefit by $125 million. Our prior assessment assumed a discount rate of 4.25 -- our prior assumed, excuse me, discount rate of 4.25% increased at year end to 4.375%, which resulted in a $60 million improvement in the FAS/CAS benefit. The actual return on our pension assets was a negative 2% rather than the 0 return we expected in October, which results in a $40 million reduction in the benefit. And with some minor adjustments, which improved $20 million, we increased the FAS/CAS benefit for 2016 by $165 million to $975 million in total. 
Chart 10 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area for the year. And all but Aeronautics have been adjusted since we spoke in October to incorporate the addition of Sikorsky, the realignment of the heritage IS&GS business, or in the case of MST, both. Overall, sales, excluding Sikorsky, will be roughly comparable to our 2000 -- to our level in 2015, although 2015 finished stronger than we had expected. And our segment operating profit and margin before the incorporation of Sikorsky is right in line with where we expected it to be when we spoke in October. 
I want to draw your attention to MST and the incorporation of Sikorsky into that business area as we've made some significant adjustments to account for purchase accounting and integration, which we'll discuss more on the next page. 
Chart 11 captures the adjustments made to Sikorsky outlook for both sales and profit. Beginning with purchase accounting, the largest impact to profit is the incorporation of the noncash intangible amortization associated with the acquisition, which lowers profit by approximately $230 million based on current projections, which can change as we finalize our purchase accounting analysis. And we impacted both sales and profit by what are called customer inventory rights. Essentially, this recognizes the portion of government contracts that were partially completed by Sikorsky before our purchase and for which Lockheed Martin can only recognize the sales and profit that has occurred since our ownership. This adjustment reduced the sales by $400 million and profit by $30 million and is weighted much more heavily in the first part of the year, as you would imagine. You will notice a similar sales reduction in 2015 described in our earnings release. Costs to integrate Sikorsky into the corporation, along with the remaining costs to complete the restructuring actions announced by Sikorsky last year before our purchase amount to another $115 million reduction in profit this year. All told, these adjustments reduce sales by around $400 million and profit by $375 million in 2016. 
If you'll turn to Chart 12, we'll discuss the impacts of the transaction with Leidos that was announced this morning. Stockholders of Lockheed Martin will receive $5 billion of value for our contributed assets in a very tax-efficient structure. Just to put some sizing to the tax benefits, we would have needed to sell the business for almost $7.7 billion to have created the same after-tax value as the transaction we announced. At current valuations, we would receive the $5 billion in the form of $3.2 billion in equity from Leidos for a 50.5% ownership in the newly formed company and $1.8 billion from a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The $1.8 billion special cash payment is fixed -- is a fixed amount through closing, while the equity amount will vary with changes in the value of Leidos' shares until closing. Because this is structured as a stock split off, an additional benefit, we would anticipate, is a reduction in our share count of up to 15 million shares. In addition, Lockheed Martin stockholders who choose to participate in the split will also benefit from the synergies created by the new company, which are expected to be $120 million a year at steady-state. And because this is anticipated to be a stock split off, we expect to have a significant book gain of more than $1.5 billion at closure. 
On Chart 13, we showed the expected high level impact of some of our future financial measures after the IS&GS transaction is complete compared to what those results would have otherwise been had we retained the IS&GS business. We expect our sales growth rate will be higher under the new structure. GAAP earnings per share should be neutral to slightly positive as the share count reduction from the transaction more than offsets the lost operating profit from IS&GS. Cash from operations is also expected to be higher as the increase in cash generation from Sikorsky offsets the lost cash generated by IS&GS. Return on invested capital should be higher after transaction as a result of using the proceeds to reduce our invested capital base, and we expect shares outstanding to be lower because of the stock split-off arrangement. And at the end of the day, we think the new organization better positions the company for long-term growth. 
Finally, on Chart 14, we have our summary. 2015 really was an exceptional performance year, particularly given the strategic actions we undertook. We finished the year strong, and we set up a very solid foundation for 2016. We continue to make cash deployment actions with our stockholders in mind, and we believe that our portfolio-shaping actions have us well-positioned for future value creation. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?"

We did have a restructuring event at the end of the last year.",330,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Howard. So you hit that there is -- this is a very complicated quarter and a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all the moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring event at the end of the last year. You saw that. This is in our MST business. It amounts to about $67 million. Think of this as sort of rightsizing that business post the integration of Sikorsky into MST. I also mentioned in the chart that shows the adjustments to Sikorsky that we're seeing some carryover what I would call restructuring charges from the actions that were taken that are Sikorsky in 2015 before our ownership that are somewhat carrying over into 2016. Those don't quite offset each other, but it's pretty close. As you said, we had the R&D tax credit that occurred at the end of 2015, which benefited us. It wasn't in our outlook until it literally happened in the month of December. The good news about that is that's now becoming permanent going forward, so because it is permanent, we've also assumed that in our 2016 outlook. We had some deal closure costs that also hit 2015, think of that as about roughly $0.09 a share or so, I think about $45 million collectively for those sort of transaction costs. And then, 2016 is where it gets complicated. We've got, as I said, the purchase accounting adjustments for Sikorsky, the integration costs for Sikorsky. So just a lot of moving pieces there. It's also important to note that as a result of the debt deal that we did to acquire Sikorsky, interest expense is somewhere on the magnitude of about $230 million or thereabouts, higher than it was in 2015. So I've hit, I think, most of the sort of the things are changing that are between the years, Howard, there are probably a couple I left off, but I think those are the big drivers."

So all good questions, Hunter. Let's see, where should I begin? So Sikorsky, because of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don't think a lot of people necessarily had in their head that there was about a $400 million reduction for sales that occurred before our ownership, if you will, that are carrying over into 2016, but that brings the sales down and profit down from what it otherwise could have been. You should think of Sikorsky as being roughly the same size as the realigned IS&GS. They're kind of both in the $5 billion range, if you want to put it in that perspective. I think, you asked about sort of apples-to-apples margins from MST before considering Sikorsky. That's a little bit hard to do because as you recall, and we talked about this in the opening remarks, the realignment of IS&GS really affects 4 of the 5 business areas. So if you put it just on the basis of what I'd call the heritage MST business before the incorporation of the portion of IS&GS that's going into it starting this year, its margins are actually fairly comparable to what they were in 2015, the IS&GS business. So think of this as the C4ISR business that was previously within IS&GS. That business coming into MST is a little bit of a margin headwind, so it brings it down a little bit. And then, I think, you talked about the prospects for Sikorsky going forward. I think, maybe the easiest way to talk about this, and I should say before I talk about the prospects going forward, we tried to capture all this. I know there's a lot that I just said, but I think we provide some pretty good insight in our schedules in the press release to show the realignment to capture all the pieces I just walked through, if that's not clear by what I just said. Sikorsky -- I think, the biggest change that we're seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes in sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today. So I think I had said at the July call that OEM sales for commercial helos had peaked at about roughly $1.5 billion. This doesn't include the aftermarket sales, which I'll portion off to the side here, but just the pure helo sales was about $1.5 billion in 2014. And what I said at the time was, we thought, because of the oil and gas pressures, we thought 2016 would probably be half that number. As it turns out, our current outlook is probably half of that number. So think of that as roughly $375 million or so of commercial helo sales in the year 2016, which -- and think of that also as being the highest margin products within the IS&GS portfolio set, some of the pressure that we're seeing. On the flip side, Hunter, what I'll tell you is we're already seeing the benefits of some of the combination, particularly on the international military side, and Marillyn talked about some of that in her opening remarks, and what I would characterize as sort of the paramilitary side. So think of that as things like Coast Guard, search and rescue and border patrol fleets. And those are actually, we think, upside to the plan and upside to the business case, at least as we initially looked at that. But those prospects won't impact 2016 and won't frankly have much impact even in 2017 if we are successful in closing on those. And then, the last thing I'd close with, Hunter, is the cash prospects going forward, we do expect to be much improved in terms of the current level of cash generated by Sikorsky going forward over the next few years, and you should think of that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore lower cash and some different terms associated with that to peer production programs that should be sort of normal cash-generating business, just like they would be within Lockheed Martin. Hopefully, that covers the waterfront for you there, Hunter."

I'd love to say it's going to happen this year, but I'm not sure I'm that good at predicting the future, but we do think we still have entitlement there. So hopefully, that helps with that question. On the C-130 multiyear, thanks for the comment relative to getting that done and it's good to have that program stretch out to 2019 now. You asked about do we have the same margin opportunity? I've described this in other forums where you should think of new multi-years as sort of starting off at a lower initial profit recording rate than probably where we ended the current or older multiyear and contracts on the C-130 program. So we'll see some, I'll say, optically lower margins from a GAAP perspective because we're starting that program lower, but at end of the day, and sort of from an economic value perspective, we would expect the current multiyear program to have very similar economics and especially similar cash flows, even from day 1, as the previous programs that we completed. So while a little bit of near-term, I'll say EPS and margin pressure relative to what we have done on years past with prior C-130 deliveries, we think, at the end of the day, the economics for those 2 programs are comparable."

So you should think of the discussion and what was talked about from the Leidos point of view as this is more of an EBITDA comparison than the EBIT numbers, the segment EBIT actually that we're showing for IS&GS, so your numbers are right, as usual. Think of it as about $360 million of segment EBIT from IS&GS this year. I mean, the first adjustment that's made to that to get to EBITDA is obviously to take out the depreciation and amortization, you should think of those being collectively about $80 million because we have some level of depreciation from the capital assets there, but we also have the amortization from previous acquisitions within IS&GS. And so that gets you to, what, about $440 million or so. The total EBITDA for this business going into Leidos, you should think of it as about in the $500 million-ish range. And the delta to go from what I just described, from the original EBITDA, EBIT -- segment EBIT, plus the depreciation and amortization, there's a lot of moving pieces to get to the top, but the biggest single one is the elimination of the pension costs.

And the words you said are exactly what I intended, which is, back to Cai's comments, we're losing think of it as $360 million of profit that you would expect to have a negative earnings per share impact. Because of this split off arrangement and the expectation that we get 15 million shares back, plus the benefits potentially of the $1.8 billion in cash, tax-free, that we'll be able to have enough share count reduction to offset the effects of that $360 million, or actually, maybe a little more than that.

So this is probably a question that was better answered from the 2 partners as opposed to a single partner. We had some good things happen recently relative to the ability to procure the Russian RD-180 engines, and think of those as for the civil and commercial marketplace. That activity is very strong. We're seeing some benefits actually from the cargo -- the CRS, I've lost track what the acronym stands for, the crew resupply or cargo resupply mission where 2 of the 3 vehicles are currently slated to be launched by Atlas vehicles. So that's helping us. We have to kind of bridge, we think, to get to the ability to develop an American engine, if you will, to replace the RD-180. Right now, it is not our expectation that, that will require contributions from the parents. But that's something that we've got to work out, sort of between our partner and the U.S. government to ensure that. As you know and as you've read, we have had some commercial development activity on the engine front and we're watching that closely and see how that plays out. But you should not think of this as requiring large contributions from a developmental perspective to develop that engine going forward. I think you also asked about the earnings in 2016, maybe compared to 2017.

That is still very much the plan and the expectation, and that is the work that the MS team is doing now. Last year was sort of spent in the integration mode, bringing Sikorsky on board and making sure everything can happen from the IT services to making payroll and the like. 2016 is very much focused on creating synergies and capturing those synergies. I had said in either the July or October call, we thought we could have about $150 million sort of steady-state run rate, that occurs probably in the 2018 time frame. So again, we're seeing a lot of the integration costs occurring in 2016 that's dampening that a bit. But the run rate is still what we expect. And as I've said, I think, on previous calls, we would expect sort of the retained portion of that run rate to go down a little bit over time as we give some portion of that back to our U.S. government on the contracts. But at the same time, we expect to start getting revenue synergies from the combination, some of which I talked about earlier on in terms of the international military market that will maintain that $150 million synergy run rate going forward."

I mean, it sort of depends on what you assume in terms of how the stock price is moving and so forth. But you should think of the RMT benefits from a share count exchange as just about getting us back to neutral. And we would expect, again, to use at least some portion of that $1.8 billion to make up the rest, and maybe there's some more on top of that, Rob. Relative to -- I think you asked about maybe 3 of the business areas, MST, Missiles and Fire Control and Space Systems for what's going on in 2016 maybe compared to 2015. I talked a little bit about this in the October call, and really, nothing has changed other than we've, again, that we've moved pieces around because of the realignment of IS&GS. But at a very high level, you should think of Missiles and Fire Control being lower than 2015. Again, we've realigned that business to remove the tech service business that was there, so it's sort of the core or heritage Missile and Fire Control is lower. Again, because we expect lower, what I would describe as in-theater demand for programs like the GMLRS, the ATACMS missile, Javelin and some of the fire control programs. And you should think of that as, again, this is reflecting a reduction in OCO funding for some of that in-theater activity that is very quick turn business to us. So even though we're talking about the procurement accounts going up, we don't expect that to offset in 2016 for Missiles and Fire Control. MST, the current outlook really makes kind for a hard comparison. So it's got Sikorsky for the full year in 2016 versus less than 2 months in 2015. The heritage, I think I talked about this earlier, the heritage MST business has slight growth '16 over '15, which reflects the continuing ramp up of the programs that were won in 2015, for that matter, 2014. And the realigned C-4 ISR business that I talked about earlier from IS&GS is expected to have sales reductions from the 2015 level for that business that are probably comparable to what is currently shown for the realigned IS&GS business in total. So that's sort of what's bringing the combined, if you will, MST without Sikorsky to the levels that we're seeing. And then, Space Systems. Space Systems is sort of a good news, bad news. A little bit lower funding for things like Orion and the Fleet Ballistic Missile programs, but the main reason is because of the lower government satellite activity in 2016 and 2015. That's a good news story because that says each incremental satellite that we're selling to the U.S. government is costing less than the previous one. We're doing about the same volume in terms of numbers of satellites, but our programs to reduce costs are paying off, and each one is subsequently cheaper, and that's what we're seeing within Space Systems."

F-35, on the international front, it will continue to ramp up. There's a strong interest, growth in those sales. In fact, in the next 5 years, about 50% of the orders will come from the international marketplace. And then, I know that there's a lot of interest in terms of oil prices. We're not seeing a lot of pullback on expenditures on national security. Certainly, oil prices affect our sale of commercial rotary wing, but in the balance of our business, while it does put some pressure on budgets in the countries that are buying national security assets and things that they need to protect their citizens, the choices that they're making are cutting in other areas so that they can protect their citizens, and so we're not seeing a big damper on that.

As you might expect, we're having sales that are coming out of backlog from prior year's orders that are not being replaced because of the -- particularly the commercial business I talked about earlier with new orders. Second one is Space. Also down pretty -- about half that number as well. And that's just the timing of orders. We had some very good orders in the past few years that are playing out to sales, and we don't have quite the size, including the Orion order a few years back, and we're not seeing those orders replicated, that they are translating into sales as we speak here. So the big orders we're watching this year, not a lot of -- frankly, not a lot of large, competitive orders that we're chasing this year. I think, the biggest orders we're looking for are the sort of the follow-on F-35 orders. In particular, lot 10 and the finalization of lot 9 and a lot of the ancillary contracts that go with both of those LRIPs. So that's a big chunk of it. The biggest single international order we're watching probably is a THAAD order with Qatar. And we have other air missile defense programs kind of scattered throughout the region, but not nearly the same size as we're seeing in Qatar, but that's the driver of the biggest international orders prospects as we see 2016."

Aeronautics margin, as I said on the October call, there's really 2 reasons for that, that are driving them below 2015. The first one being, as I call, the dilutive effect of the F-35 program, even though the margins on F-35 are increasing year-over-year, they're still lower than the overall composite rate for aeronautics, and that's bringing the rate down slightly. The other reason primarily was the C-130 impact that, I think, Rich was talking about relative to the sort of the conversion of older C-130 contracts and now booking sales under a new multiyear. Again, economically, I don't see a lot of difference between the 2, but from a sort of a GAAP reporting perspective, we'll expect to have sort of a lower starting margin on the new multiyear than the ending margin on the previously negotiated C-130 contracts. And those 2 are what are kind of bringing down the margins of aeronautics in '16 compared to '15. I do think -- I think, you asked about what's the prospects going forward? I think, 2016 is sort of the bottom point, if that makes sense relative to the margins of aeronautics. And we would expect to see slow improvements going forward every year, primarily as we see the sort of getting to, I'll say, an ordinary production program on the F-35 program starts to take effect as well as the inevitable increases on C-130 because we're starting off at a lower booking rate [ph] than we are right now. 2000 -- I think you asked about 2017 FAS/CAS. I would expect it to be -- and look, I always hesitate to look talk about next year, there's so many moving pieces in FAS/CAS that if we were to -- sort of current course and speed is always the way I like to describe it, we're about $975 million today.

Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. As today's release illustrates, we completed another quarter of solid operational accomplishments, while exceeding all of our full year financial goals, and I couldn't be more proud of our team. They remain focused on mission success for our customers and financial results for stockholders while also supporting extensive portfolio reshaping actions.
We have a number of significant events to discuss today. In addition to reviewing our financial and operational results, I want to provide an update on the FY '16 DoD budget and a discussion of 2 completed strategic actions: the closure of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft; and our decision to separate and combine our Information Systems & Global Solutions business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.
Financially, 2015 was an exceptional year, with achievement of multiple, new high-water marks for the corporation. I was especially pleased to see the broad-based domestic and international customer support for our portfolio of products. This support resulted in our achieving a record level of backlog of nearly $100 billion. Excluding the acquired Sikorsky backlog, the rest of our portfolio achieved $84 billion, significantly surpassing the $80 billion goal we outlined at the beginning of 2015. Our backlog has us positioned to deliver expanding sales levels and financial results as we move forward in 2016 and beyond.
A second area where we achieved another high-water mark was the generation of over $5 billion in cash from operations, achieving a record annual level for the corporation in this critically important area. This cash flow is only achieved through the daily efforts and focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers. The robust cash generation also enabled us to expand our cash returned to stockholders to a record annual level of $5 billion, achieved through our industry-leading dividend payout level and ongoing share repurchase activity.
For 2015, share repurchases reduced the year-end outstanding share count to approximately 305 million shares. We are well on our way to achieve or exceed our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017. Overall, the corporation continued to excel in the attributes we most value: providing critical solutions to customer and returning value to stockholders.
Looking beyond 2015, our 2016 guidance outlined today results in increased sales, earnings per share and growing cash from operations. The guidance includes the Sikorsky financials from the recently completed acquisition and also reflects the realignment of our information technology and Technical Services businesses. The guidance also assumes continuation of the results for the full year of 2016 from the Information Systems and Global Solutions business identified in our strategic review. We will adjust our financial outlook later this year when the disposition of IS&GS is completed. Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts.
I'd like to briefly discuss the defense budget. Since we spoke last quarter, significant uncertainty was removed with the successful completion of a bipartisan agreement of the FY '16 base DoD budget. The new budget reflects an annual increase of approximately $25 billion, above the previously planned budget level, and is also the first increase in annual DoD budget since 2012. The budget is a recognition of increasing global security requirements and the need to allocate additional fiscal resources to respond to the threat environment. 
A key element in the increased DoD budget is a double-digit annual percentage increase in the investment accounts that fund new equipment procurement and research development -- research and development activities. This strong funding increase will be used to address the acute need to replace aging equipment, while ensuring development of key new technologies to respond to evolving security requirements facing domestic and international customers. As part of the budget, we were pleased to see 11 additional F-35 aircraft added in the FY '16 omnibus. This marks the first time in the history of the F-35 program that aircraft were added to the baseline request, demonstrating strong support for our largest program. We believe our portfolio of products and new technologies will line up very well with essential recapitalization actions in the areas of ballistic missile defense, tactical missiles and rotary aircraft.
I'd like to now turn to the 2 strategic actions we announced back in July. First, we were proud to welcome the Sikorsky team to Lockheed Martin with the successful closure of their acquisition on November 6. Together, we will build upon a legacy of innovation and performance that has shaped the history of aviation for more than a century. This action advances our commitment to provide customers with affordable mission-ready solutions in rotary aircraft. Their inclusion will enable us to move forward with our goal to expand our business into the strategically important areas of helicopter production and sustainment. Since the transaction closure, the combined team at Mission Systems and Training have hit the ground running. We are already seeing accelerated customer interest in both military and search and rescue opportunities emerging in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe.
It is increasingly clear that we will be better together as we leverage our combined scale and serve as a technology leader at the forefront of vertical lift. I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term value creation of this business as we move forward in providing essential products and solutions to customers around the world.
Turning to our second strategic item. As announced earlier today, we completed the review of our Information Systems & Global Solutions businesses. That review culminated in our decision to separate and combine our IS&GS business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We are excited about this path forward and believe this is the best fit strategically and will be beneficial to the shareholders of both corporations. This transaction is an important milestone in the portfolio-shaping strategy we announced last July and allows us to focus on our core business in aerospace and defense.
The combination of our proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a more diversified competitor positioned for growth and future success, while unlocking value for our stockholders. This agreement aligns the IS&GS business with an industry leader in government IT and technical services and will create an enterprise capable of providing unparalleled solutions in industries ranging from national security to health and life sciences. The complementary portfolios of both companies will create a diversified and balanced business mix with expanded domain expertise, increased advantages of scale efficiencies and synergy opportunities. These benefits will be the foundation to create value for stockholders, customers and employees.
One of the important goals in our strategic evaluation of the business was to ensure that the final decision provides a good cultural fit and home for IS&GS employees. It is my belief that employee morale and opportunities for their growth are key elements in the future success of every enterprise. Over the last few months, during our many interactions with Leidos, we have come to know their management and culture, and we are confident that this combination fully satisfies our employee goals. Bruce will speak more about the financial aspects of the transaction and the projected timeline for closure in his remarks.
I'd like to end my remarks with a few key operational highlights in the fourth quarter that enabled the corporation to finish the year on a very strong note. Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we achieved our full year delivery goal of 45 aircraft to domestic and international customers. This delivery level reflects our continuing ramp-up in production on the program and is a 25% increase above prior-year deliveries. For 2016, we are expecting additional production expansion with planned deliveries increasing to 53 aircraft. The team also continued to retire key tasks on the F-35 development program as we look forward to completing remaining tasks in 2016 as the development phase winds down.
Switching to the C-130J air lifter. Multiple highlights were achieved in the quarter with delivery of the 25th -- 2,500th aircraft and receipt of the multiyear [indiscernible] contract that extends the production line into late 2019. This contract was a portion of the $26 billion in total new contract awards we secured in the quarter and enabled achievement of a strong book-to-bill ratio for the full year of 2015. We also made progress on growing our international sales content, which grew 6% above prior year levels and expanding the international sales content to 21% of total corporate sales.
I'll close by stating that 2015 was an exceptional year for our corporation, and we implemented bold strategic actions to better position the business for operational and financial success. We secured record new business awards and cash generation, both essential components to future corporate success and value creation.
Looking forward, I'm enthusiastic about the future contributions we can provide to customers and stockholders with our enhanced corporate posture. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2016 financial guidance, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,321233745,921248,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year.",1639,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales for the year were $46.1 billion, ahead of our expectations from when we spoke in the third quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected, ending the year at 11.9%, and this enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $11.46 for the year. Cash from operations for the year was our highest ever at $5.1 billion. We returned $5 billion of cash to our stockholders in the year, led by repurchasing 15.2 million shares for $3.1 billion. And we grew our backlog significantly to almost $100 billion with the integration of Sikorsky into the corporation. We'll cover all these items in more detail in the coming charts for what was an exceptional year in 2015.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales were about $0.5 billion higher this year than last year, including the addition of about $400 million of sales from Sikorsky for the short period after the close in early November. Even without the Sikorsky sales, we were slightly higher than last year's results and better than we had expected when we spoke in October, as we had higher volume in several business areas as we closed the year. Earnings per share were $0.25 higher than last year at $11.46 for the full year and were also higher than the guidance we provided in October, driven by the increased sales volume and improved performance.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 15.2 million shares in 2015, nearly 4 million shares more than in 2014, and that brought our shares outstanding at year-end to 305 million shares. This positions us well to achieve our goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. At the end of 2015, we have around 4 million unexercised options, which is a significantly lower level than we had several years ago. And the announced transaction with Leidos creates the potential to reduce share count by up to 15 million shares upon closure later this year.
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash returned to stockholders in 2015. Our cash from operations, as we said earlier, was $5.1 billion. And with about $900 million in capital expenditures in the year, we had $4.2 billion of free cash flow. With $1.9 billion in dividends, along with the $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we returned $5 billion to our stockholders in 2015, the highest amount in our history, and this represents 120% of our free cash flow for the year.
Chart 7 shows our backlog levels over the last 5 years. 2015 represents the fifth consecutive year that we've ended the year with more than $80 billion in backlog. Without the addition of Sikorsky's backlog, 2015 would have still represented the highest backlog level in our history at more than $84 billion. And with Sikorsky, our backlog is nearly $100 billion.
On Chart 8, we discuss our outlook for 2016. We're expecting sales to be in the range of $49.5 billion to $51 billion, and this range includes the realigned IS&GS business area for the entire year as it is our practice not to incorporate adjustments such as our RMT transaction until they've been consummated. I'll provide more color on the sales ranges by business area in a couple of charts.
Our outlook for segment operating profit is a range of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000, and I'll also show you the range by business area in a couple of charts. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is higher than we provided on the October call, and I'll discuss the reasons behind the increase on the next chart. We expect our earnings per share will be between $11.45 and $11.75 for the year. And our outlook from cash from operations is strong again this year at $5.3 billion, up from the $5 billion we projected in the October call.
Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of the expected 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment that we discussed in October compared with our current guidance. We had an actuarial update to the mortality or longevity assumptions that reduced our longevity estimates and results in a lower FAS expense and increased the FAS/CAS benefit by $125 million. Our prior assessment assumed a discount rate of 4.25 -- our prior assumed, excuse me, discount rate of 4.25% increased at year end to 4.375%, which resulted in a $60 million improvement in the FAS/CAS benefit. The actual return on our pension assets was a negative 2% rather than the 0 return we expected in October, which results in a $40 million reduction in the benefit. And with some minor adjustments, which improved $20 million, we increased the FAS/CAS benefit for 2016 by $165 million to $975 million in total.
Chart 10 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area for the year. And all but Aeronautics have been adjusted since we spoke in October to incorporate the addition of Sikorsky, the realignment of the heritage IS&GS business, or in the case of MST, both. Overall, sales, excluding Sikorsky, will be roughly comparable to our 2000 -- to our level in 2015, although 2015 finished stronger than we had expected. And our segment operating profit and margin before the incorporation of Sikorsky is right in line with where we expected it to be when we spoke in October.
I want to draw your attention to MST and the incorporation of Sikorsky into that business area as we've made some significant adjustments to account for purchase accounting and integration, which we'll discuss more on the next page.
Chart 11 captures the adjustments made to Sikorsky outlook for both sales and profit. Beginning with purchase accounting, the largest impact to profit is the incorporation of the noncash intangible amortization associated with the acquisition, which lowers profit by approximately $230 million based on current projections, which can change as we finalize our purchase accounting analysis. And we impacted both sales and profit by what are called customer inventory rights. Essentially, this recognizes the portion of government contracts that were partially completed by Sikorsky before our purchase and for which Lockheed Martin can only recognize the sales and profit that has occurred since our ownership. This adjustment reduced the sales by $400 million and profit by $30 million and is weighted much more heavily in the first part of the year, as you would imagine. You will notice a similar sales reduction in 2015 described in our earnings release. Costs to integrate Sikorsky into the corporation, along with the remaining costs to complete the restructuring actions announced by Sikorsky last year before our purchase amount to another $115 million reduction in profit this year. All told, these adjustments reduce sales by around $400 million and profit by $375 million in 2016.
If you'll turn to Chart 12, we'll discuss the impacts of the transaction with Leidos that was announced this morning. Stockholders of Lockheed Martin will receive $5 billion of value for our contributed assets in a very tax-efficient structure. Just to put some sizing to the tax benefits, we would have needed to sell the business for almost $7.7 billion to have created the same after-tax value as the transaction we announced. At current valuations, we would receive the $5 billion in the form of $3.2 billion in equity from Leidos for a 50.5% ownership in the newly formed company and $1.8 billion from a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. 
The $1.8 billion special cash payment is fixed -- is a fixed amount through closing, while the equity amount will vary with changes in the value of Leidos' shares until closing. Because this is structured as a stock split off, an additional benefit, we would anticipate, is a reduction in our share count of up to 15 million shares. In addition, Lockheed Martin stockholders who choose to participate in the split will also benefit from the synergies created by the new company, which are expected to be $120 million a year at steady-state. And because this is anticipated to be a stock split off, we expect to have a significant book gain of more than $1.5 billion at closure.
On Chart 13, we showed the expected high level impact of some of our future financial measures after the IS&GS transaction is complete compared to what those results would have otherwise been had we retained the IS&GS business. We expect our sales growth rate will be higher under the new structure. GAAP earnings per share should be neutral to slightly positive as the share count reduction from the transaction more than offsets the lost operating profit from IS&GS. Cash from operations is also expected to be higher as the increase in cash generation from Sikorsky offsets the lost cash generated by IS&GS. Return on invested capital should be higher after transaction as a result of using the proceeds to reduce our invested capital base, and we expect shares outstanding to be lower because of the stock split-off arrangement. And at the end of the day, we think the new organization better positions the company for long-term growth.
Finally, on Chart 14, we have our summary. 2015 really was an exceptional performance year, particularly given the strategic actions we undertook. We finished the year strong, and we set up a very solid foundation for 2016. We continue to make cash deployment actions with our stockholders in mind, and we believe that our portfolio-shaping actions have us well-positioned for future value creation. With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?"

So you hit that there is -- this is a very complicated quarter and a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all the moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring event at the end of the last year. You saw that. This is in our MST business. It amounts to about $67 million. Think of this as sort of rightsizing that business post the integration of Sikorsky into MST. I also mentioned in the chart that shows the adjustments to Sikorsky that we're seeing some carryover what I would call restructuring charges from the actions that were taken that are Sikorsky in 2015 before our ownership that are somewhat carrying over into 2016. Those don't quite offset each other, but it's pretty close. As you said, we had the R&D tax credit that occurred at the end of 2015, which benefited us. It wasn't in our outlook until it literally happened in the month of December. The good news about that is that's now becoming permanent going forward, so because it is permanent, we've also assumed that in our 2016 outlook. We had some deal closure costs that also hit 2015, think of that as about roughly $0.09 a share or so, I think about $45 million collectively for those sort of transaction costs. And then, 2016 is where it gets complicated. We've got, as I said, the purchase accounting adjustments for Sikorsky, the integration costs for Sikorsky. So just a lot of moving pieces there. It's also important to note that as a result of the debt deal that we did to acquire Sikorsky, interest expense is somewhere on the magnitude of about $230 million or thereabouts, higher than it was in 2015. So I've hit, I think, most of the sort of the things are changing that are between the years, Howard, there are probably a couple I left off, but I think those are the big drivers."

So all good questions, Hunter. Let's see, where should I begin? So Sikorsky, because of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don't think a lot of people necessarily had in their head that there was about a $400 million reduction for sales that occurred before our ownership, if you will, that are carrying over into 2016, but that brings the sales down and profit down from what it otherwise could have been. You should think of Sikorsky as being roughly the same size as the realigned IS&GS. They're kind of both in the $5 billion range, if you want to put it in that perspective. I think, you asked about sort of apples-to-apples margins from MST before considering Sikorsky. That's a little bit hard to do because as you recall, and we talked about this in the opening remarks, the realignment of IS&GS really affects 4 of the 5 business areas. So if you put it just on the basis of what I'd call the heritage MST business before the incorporation of the portion of IS&GS that's going into it starting this year, its margins are actually fairly comparable to what they were in 2015, the IS&GS business. So think of this as the C4ISR business that was previously within IS&GS. That business coming into MST is a little bit of a margin headwind, so it brings it down a little bit. And then, I think, you talked about the prospects for Sikorsky going forward. I think, maybe the easiest way to talk about this, and I should say before I talk about the prospects going forward, we tried to capture all this. I know there's a lot that I just said, but I think we provide some pretty good insight in our schedules in the press release to show the realignment to capture all the pieces I just walked through, if that's not clear by what I just said. Sikorsky -- I think, the biggest change that we're seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes in sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today. So I think I had said at the July call that OEM sales for commercial helos had peaked at about roughly $1.5 billion. This doesn't include the aftermarket sales, which I'll portion off to the side here, but just the pure helo sales was about $1.5 billion in 2014. And what I said at the time was, we thought, because of the oil and gas pressures, we thought 2016 would probably be half that number. As it turns out, our current outlook is probably half of that number. So think of that as roughly $375 million or so of commercial helo sales in the year 2016, which -- and think of that also as being the highest margin products within the IS&GS portfolio set, some of the pressure that we're seeing. On the flip side, Hunter, what I'll tell you is we're already seeing the benefits of some of the combination, particularly on the international military side, and Marillyn talked about some of that in her opening remarks, and what I would characterize as sort of the paramilitary side. So think of that as things like Coast Guard, search and rescue and border patrol fleets. And those are actually, we think, upside to the plan and upside to the business case, at least as we initially looked at that. But those prospects won't impact 2016 and won't frankly have much impact even in 2017 if we are successful in closing on those. And then, the last thing I'd close with, Hunter, is the cash prospects going forward, we do expect to be much improved in terms of the current level of cash generated by Sikorsky going forward over the next few years, and you should think of that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore lower cash and some different terms associated with that to peer production programs that should be sort of normal cash-generating business, just like they would be within Lockheed Martin. Hopefully, that covers the waterfront for you there, Hunter."

I'd love to say it's going to happen this year, but I'm not sure I'm that good at predicting the future, but we do think we still have entitlement there. So hopefully, that helps with that question. On the C-130 multiyear, thanks for the comment relative to getting that done and it's good to have that program stretch out to 2019 now. You asked about do we have the same margin opportunity? I've described this in other forums where you should think of new multi-years as sort of starting off at a lower initial profit recording rate than probably where we ended the current or older multiyear and contracts on the C-130 program. So we'll see some, I'll say, optically lower margins from a GAAP perspective because we're starting that program lower, but at end of the day, and sort of from an economic value perspective, we would expect the current multiyear program to have very similar economics and especially similar cash flows, even from day 1, as the previous programs that we completed. So while a little bit of near-term, I'll say EPS and margin pressure relative to what we have done on years past with prior C-130 deliveries, we think, at the end of the day, the economics for those 2 programs are comparable."

So you should think of the discussion and what was talked about from the Leidos point of view as this is more of an EBITDA comparison than the EBIT numbers, the segment EBIT actually that we're showing for IS&GS, so your numbers are right, as usual. Think of it as about $360 million of segment EBIT from IS&GS this year. I mean, the first adjustment that's made to that to get to EBITDA is obviously to take out the depreciation and amortization, you should think of those being collectively about $80 million because we have some level of depreciation from the capital assets there, but we also have the amortization from previous acquisitions within IS&GS. And so that gets you to, what, about $440 million or so. The total EBITDA for this business going into Leidos, you should think of it as about in the $500 million-ish range. And the delta to go from what I just described, from the original EBITDA, EBIT -- segment EBIT, plus the depreciation and amortization, there's a lot of moving pieces to get to the top, but the biggest single one is the elimination of the pension costs. We are retaining those assets and liabilities, and therefore, that cost reduction is what the other benefit is to get to roughly the $0.5 billion of EBITDA for IS&GS in the new structure."

We're seeing some benefits actually from the cargo -- the CRS, I've lost track what the acronym stands for, the crew resupply or cargo resupply mission where 2 of the 3 vehicles are currently slated to be launched by Atlas vehicles. So that's helping us. We have to kind of bridge, we think, to get to the ability to develop an American engine, if you will, to replace the RD-180.

I had said in either the July or October call, we thought we could have about $150 million sort of steady-state run rate, that occurs probably in the 2018 time frame. So again, we're seeing a lot of the integration costs occurring in 2016 that's dampening that a bit. But the run rate is still what we expect.

But you should think of the RMT benefits from a share count exchange as just about getting us back to neutral. And we would expect, again, to use at least some portion of that $1.8 billion to make up the rest, and maybe there's some more on top of that, Rob. Relative to -- I think you asked about maybe 3 of the business areas, MST, Missiles and Fire Control and Space Systems for what's going on in 2016 maybe compared to 2015. I talked a little bit about this in the October call, and really, nothing has changed other than we've, again, that we've moved pieces around because of the realignment of IS&GS. But at a very high level, you should think of Missiles and Fire Control being lower than 2015. Again, we've realigned that business to remove the tech service business that was there, so it's sort of the core or heritage Missile and Fire Control is lower. Again, because we expect lower, what I would describe as in-theater demand for programs like the GMLRS, the ATACMS missile, Javelin and some of the fire control programs. And you should think of that as, again, this is reflecting a reduction in OCO funding for some of that in-theater activity that is very quick turn business to us. So even though we're talking about the procurement accounts going up, we don't expect that to offset in 2016 for Missiles and Fire Control. MST, the current outlook really makes kind for a hard comparison. So it's got Sikorsky for the full year in 2016 versus less than 2 months in 2015. The heritage, I think I talked about this earlier, the heritage MST business has slight growth '16 over '15, which reflects the continuing ramp up of the programs that were won in 2015, for that matter, 2014. And the realigned C-4 ISR business that I talked about earlier from IS&GS is expected to have sales reductions from the 2015 level for that business that are probably comparable to what is currently shown for the realigned IS&GS business in total. So that's sort of what's bringing the combined, if you will, MST without Sikorsky to the levels that we're seeing. And then, Space Systems. Space Systems is sort of a good news, bad news. A little bit lower funding for things like Orion and the Fleet Ballistic Missile programs, but the main reason is because of the lower government satellite activity in 2016 and 2015. That's a good news story because that says each incremental satellite that we're selling to the U.S. government is costing less than the previous one. We're doing about the same volume in terms of numbers of satellites, but our programs to reduce costs are paying off, and each one is subsequently cheaper, and that's what we're seeing within Space Systems."

It's just sort of getting them, them in this case being Sikorsky, in parallel to what we do with all the other business within Lockheed Martin. So we know the game plan. We know the playbook. We just have to sort of execute it with Sikorsky."

We continue to have growing international interest for our programs, particularly in the area of missile defense. And in the Middle East and Asia Pacific and even in Europe where Germany has selected MEADS as their missile defense capability, and Aegis Ashore. So that is an expanding demand. We continue to see that. With some of the current conflict in the Middle East, we're seeing some of our ammunitions and things of that nature that there's a continuing desire for our targeting pods and other things that they need in the current conflict. F-35, on the international front, it will continue to ramp up. There's a strong interest, growth in those sales. In fact, in the next 5 years, about 50% of the orders will come from the international marketplace. And then, I know that there's a lot of interest in terms of oil prices. We're not seeing a lot of pullback on expenditures on national security. Certainly, oil prices affect our sale of commercial rotary wing, but in the balance of our business, while it does put some pressure on budgets in the countries that are buying national security assets and things that they need to protect their citizens, the choices that they're making are cutting in other areas so that they can protect their citizens, and so we're not seeing a big damper on that. There may be some things that will slip out a little bit or they might reduce the volume on the near term but they're still going to buy the products and capabilities and technologies they need to enable them to protect their citizens and to deal with their security issues."

MST will have -- and when I say down, we're talking probably somewhere less than $5 billion down, maybe $4 billion, and probably half or so of that is MST. The bulk of which of that is for Sikorsky. As you might expect, we're having sales that are coming out of backlog from prior year's orders that are not being replaced because of the -- particularly the commercial business I talked about earlier with new orders. Second one is Space. Also down pretty -- about half that number as well. And that's just the timing of orders. We had some very good orders in the past few years that are playing out to sales, and we don't have quite the size, including the Orion order a few years back, and we're not seeing those orders replicated, that they are translating into sales as we speak here. So the big orders we're watching this year, not a lot of -- frankly, not a lot of large, competitive orders that we're chasing this year. I think, the biggest orders we're looking for are the sort of the follow-on F-35 orders. In particular, lot 10 and the finalization of lot 9 and a lot of the ancillary contracts that go with both of those LRIPs. So that's a big chunk of it. The biggest single international order we're watching probably is a THAAD order with Qatar. And we have other air missile defense programs kind of scattered throughout the region, but not nearly the same size as we're seeing in Qatar, but that's the driver of the biggest international orders prospects as we see 2016."

Aeronautics margin, as I said on the October call, there's really 2 reasons for that, that are driving them below 2015. The first one being, as I call, the dilutive effect of the F-35 program, even though the margins on F-35 are increasing year-over-year, they're still lower than the overall composite rate for aeronautics, and that's bringing the rate down slightly. The other reason primarily was the C-130 impact that, I think, Rich was talking about relative to the sort of the conversion of older C-130 contracts and now booking sales under a new multiyear. Again, economically, I don't see a lot of difference between the 2, but from a sort of a GAAP reporting perspective, we'll expect to have sort of a lower starting margin on the new multiyear than the ending margin on the previously negotiated C-130 contracts. And those 2 are what are kind of bringing down the margins of aeronautics in '16 compared to '15. I do think -- I think you asked about what's the prospects going forward. I think, 2016 is sort of the bottom point, if that makes sense relative to the margins of aeronautics. And we would expect to see slow improvements going forward every year, primarily as we see the sort of getting to, I'll say, an ordinary production program on the F-35 program starts to take effect as well as the inevitable increases on C-130 because we're starting off at a lower booking rate [ph] than we are right now. 2000 -- I think you asked about 2017 FAS/CAS. I would expect it to be -- and look, I always hesitate to look talk about next year, there's so many moving pieces in FAS/CAS that if we were to -- sort of current course and speed is always the way I like to describe it, we're about $975 million today. It's probably in the $450 million higher next year if we were to strike a line today. But obviously, a lot of things can change between now and the end of the year."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We are pleased to have you with us as we review our first quarter results and full year outlook for 2016.
As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, financially and operationally. The corporation continued to perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders.
I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter including an update on our Sikorsky activities as well as the current status of the strategic position of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business Leidos.
Turning to the quarter, our team continue to deliver broad-based results across the corporation with achievement of first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year.
Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts.
One of the standout items in the results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash generation is a financial hallmark of our corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders in this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. I would also note that share repurchases year-to-date have reduced the outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares. This lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017.
This long-standing goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by stock exchange contained in the deal transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our corporation at deal closure also provides cash deployment and share reduction opportunities.
For the full year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my high-level perspectives on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes, procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the integration process. We continue to see cost reductions and efficiency opportunities emerging as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas like supply chain where multiple business areas procure similar materials have allowed us to look at where we can realize better buying power and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this acquisition.
Moving to an operational perspective, significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight test program and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase.
Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the U.S. Navy for long-lead items required for the first 2 CH-53K helicopters on low-rate initial production lot 1. These initial units are part of enabled aviation procurement plan to field 200 helicopters in the program in coming years.
In the area of commercial helicopters, we are seeing some emerging interests from other consumers beyond the oil and gas sector for S92 platforms, and we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and international military segments.
We also see significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in sustainment. To pursue this area, we recently opened a state-of-the-art customer care center in Connecticut that is designed to enhance platform reliability and ensure 24 -- 24-hour availability to customers' aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term creation of the Rotary aircraft business to customers around the world.
Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area. Key events associated with the pending strategic disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United Kingdom. We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing and a comparable filing by Leidos initiated a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed Martin stockholders.
Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Overall, the program continues to progress on satisfying remaining development activities while also ramping up the production rate. Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter and included the completion of the first transatlantic F-35 flight from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the U.S. to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots, surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations. And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve initial operation capability of Scitor aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC scheduled later this year.
I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this quarter by our Aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we remain agile and competitive in our cost structure. In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses implemented voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions. While these reductions resulted in special severance charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business opportunities with a leaner cost structure.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,329846235,962945,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.Let's begin with Chart 3 and our overview of results for the quarter. Sal",662,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with Chart 3 and our overview of results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion, slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $2.58, which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with planned headcount reductions. We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better-than-expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of about $1 billion and more than $600 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by about $400 million in higher F-35 production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries.
Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results included severance charges for reductions in Aeronautics and IS&GS as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from operations and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash return to shareholders was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter, we are right on track to our planned level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.
If you turn to chart 6, we'll provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter, we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We are increasing our sales outlook by $100 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter. We're increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share, and I'll discuss that in greater detail on the next chart. And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million, consistent with our improved profit outlook.
Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook, $125 million increase in segment operating profit results and a $0.26 increase in EPS, while the $100 million special charges associated with our severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart.
On Chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the sales ranges for the other core business areas at this time. 
Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit outlook in 4 of our 5 business areas with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each, while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million. 
And finally, on Chart 10, we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share in cash from operations. We continue to provide significant tax returns to our stockholders, and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year.
With that, we're ready for questions, Abigail."

I think, we had $190 million increase in sales on about a $10 million or so increase in profits what we called out, I think, on the earnings release. This is somewhat what I talked about, I think, either in October on January where we're sort of finishing kind of older, I'd say multiyear contract. It's more than a multiyear contract with an older contract of C-130s that we performed well on, and it's at the tail end of that contract and we're starting off with the start of the new deliveries and new performance on a new multiyear contract that was just negotiated. So some of that is sort of the resetting in my words of the profits, initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As I've said, all along, I still think the economics between the 2 contracts are very similar. But as our sort of historical practice, we're starting that program a little lower than we ended the last part of our C-130s, if that makes sense. On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you're right. We did not increase for the year. We're watching that closely. I'll just leave it that. As we sit here in the first quarter, didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is some upside opportunity. We've seen some good signs, particularly, as you said, Carter, on some of the consumables, particularly in some of our Middle East customers, but I'm watching this to see if it's perhaps something later on in the year but not at this time."

We should think of, essentially, all the international orders for both PAC-3 missiles as well as the program or sort of combined with U.S. orders, so they'll perform essentially at parity with U.S. orders over that period of time. There's not, per se, any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the U.S. military portion of the order, if you will. And this again, is somewhat akin to what I talked about just now in the C-130 where we have sort of a shifting from an older contract where we closed out a good performing contract and a newly negotiated contract where we're starting off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make, and that's exactly what's going on in both the PAC-3 and as we negotiated some new contracts, and they're starting off slightly lower margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up. Again economically, I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference between the contracts but sort of from a booking perspective, that's the way that's pulling out but I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk that we have associated with those deliveries."

I think from a big picture perspective, we do expect them to increase sequentially year-over-year. We talked about last year being an expectation of 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program. We achieved that. I think I talked about, again either October or January, the fact that we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016 than 2015. We still expect that, although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015. And we would expect that trend to continue in '17 and '18 as we start to sort of progress to what you're describing, Rich, which is our ultimate expectation, which is by the time we get full rate production, the margins on the F-35 look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its life cycle as F-16 margins, F-122, C-130, et cetera. So I don't think that we're deviating from that expectation. Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we have probably slightly higher pickups on the production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step-ups on production contracts this quarter as well. last year's first quarter results, I know I didn't talk about this last year. We were actually close on 10% of the production program. So it will sort of peak and valley depending on the step-ups and when they occur and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter, but our expectation, again, is we'll get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production. Your second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated, pretty comparable margin levels as the production programs. So it's not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is growing fairly rapidly. We're going to start seeing some of the sustainment contracts, sort of split out of the production contracts as this volume gets bigger. So we may in the future talk about sustainment separately from production, but you shouldn't think of that is being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point."

So I don't think Sikorsky -- we're still early into the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results, so I'm still getting my head around describing Sikorsky and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That's both from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective or EBIT perspective and sort of front-end-loaded during the year with these things I talked about in last quarter's call, these customer lean rights that sort of depress sales because of sales or products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That plays out sort of for the most part in this first half of this year, so we would expect to see sort of sequential growth in sales at Sikorsky quarter-over-quarter with the fourth quarter, obviously, being the highest quarter of the year. Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increase quarter-over-quarter. Again, obviously, having the fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well, and this is again some of the timing of the customer lean rights in the first half of the year as well. So I'd say just big picture, that's pretty much in line with what we expected to happen in the first quarter. We're going to watch it throughout the year, and we'll give you updates as we grow and progress through the rest of the year. Secondly, Joe, you asked the question about 2018 pension funding, so we have described several years ago our expectation that we were going to have a 3-year pension holiday cash funding holiday, as I called it, I think. And that was 2015, '16, and '17. And unfortunately, that holiday does stop at the end of 2017, and in 2018, we would expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think, as we sit here today, Joe, that's probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so. But importantly, I think you shouldn't think of that as falling off the cliff from 2017."

And I'll say, I mean, obviously, we increased the outlook for both sales and profit, so it's exceeded our expectations. I think there's a couple of things going on, and some of them are a little subtle. So sales and -- this is a tough business to sort of predict, which competitions are you going to and which ones are you going to not win and you get scenarios where things get protested even if you lose and therefore you can actually get the sales stretched out of those. We're sort of seeing all those happen at the same time. So one thing I'm really pleased with, probably more than anything even higher than sales volume because it gets a little bit hard to recall is the better-than-expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write-off on an international contract. And even with that write-off, we still exceeded our expectations, and we still, as obviously, we said earlier increased our guidance for the year. I think that's sort of due to 3 reasons that as I look at the start of big picture-wise, one, we had expected a number of free compete activities to occur in some of our larger contracts in the year. And these -- we bid those probably more aggressive than the previous contract where we were the incumbent, and because these contracts are actually being protested, we are continuing the performance on the older contracts, which are the higher margin on the incumbent contracts. So it's good for us from both the sales perspective, and more importantly, on the margin side because of that. I think we also had better performance sort of the closeout or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time, and we're actually performing very, very well on those transition periods, have taken some cost out higher than our expectations, which are resulting in higher margins. And then the third thing I would just say is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team and, I think, credit goes to that team. I think it's indicative of the fact that they haven't taken their eyes off the ball. It's a well-run organization, and the entire team understands that the mission they perform for their customers is important no matter who they work for, and I think we're seeing that play out live in person in front of us here. I'll ask Marillyn to answer the other question you asked for."

I'll pick up on the second part where you asked about at the time of transaction how to think about some of the puts and takes in the headcount and how we think about that.

They've outlined some commitments for the year and we're performing the commitments and the whole team in IS&GS is making sure that their cost structure is in line with the business base that they have. So as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in, it's ultracompetitive, and it's an area that you got to constantly be watching your cost and you have to manage that. There's close coordination with Leidos as they make headcount reductions. Certainly, we have an agreement as we're going through this process quoting the transaction, so actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side if they are aware that are going to take those kinds of actions, but it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on the business.

So no issue there. It was just a transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side, there is no issue. There is more of a not quite administrative but not a production issue there. You talked about Sikorsky within MST, and our guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That's what we're showing, David, in the outlook there. And even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings perspective with MST, that's one that we're watching closely. It's a little early in the the year to go more than that, but I think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we've got on the table right now. If you just do the math the way you did it, David, with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the 3 quarters of the year, you can come to that conclusion as well. And then lastly, the -- I think the Sikorsky, you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS, so all this has to do with the share reduction from the reverse Morris stress transaction and expectation of some of the bleed-off of transition costs are transaction costs including the integration. That's still our expectation, David, is that we'll be neutral going into 2017 with all the pluses and minuses going into that."

Even though it's down, that's not down as much as what our plan suggested it might be. An interesting thing we're going to have, probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year or at least as we see it, is the orders that this year wheel probably not as large a fourth quarter from a little as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year, and that's sort of the planning and the biggest single ticket item there is the or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35, and that's worth a significant amount of money. Depending on when that happens and when IS&GS is dispositioned, we can actually see potentially $100 billion [ph] worth of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS disposition. And if I was to pick a number, it's probably going to be somewhere between 90 and -- low 90s to $95 billion, excuse me, by year-end as the expectation.

It could potentially delay. I think it's not an indication they're not going to buy it. To me, it's just a matter of them balancing the pressure on their budgets the oil prices balancing what they can buy, and I think that we'll see probably some of that. Maybe it will impact some volumes or delays and some orders but the bottom line is the conflict in that region, you know the challenges they have the global security standpoint and because they have increased security responsibility since the U.S. is not so prevalent there, they're having to step up and buy the things that we need -- that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued demand. It's just a matter of maybe some things will slip. That's not unusual in the international marketplace even on a good day.

Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that, Sam, and we actually had -- and Marillyn can comment on this as well, obviously, but we actually had a lot of discussions with the board and our compensation committee. And the concern was that because orders are so variable, I mean a perfect example perhaps is you can imagine a scenario where we had won the bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you give actually someone credit for having won it or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home? These are some of the real live conversations that we had, and we ultimately decided that the sales, earnings and cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of awards. I'll remind you also that we do have a incentive compensation metric associated with focused programs and the thought was as long as we win the right programs, I mean, whether or not -- I make this up, whether or not the fiscal year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January, it's probably not as important as winning some of our critical competitions. And so we decided to start the focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they happen again end of this year or beginning of next year."

But as we flow down those metrics throughout the organization, the individuals in the organization are still going to be tracking their orders. They're still going to be driving to achieve levels of financial performance on the orders front, so it's not something we've taken out.

The reason I highlighted the first quarter of last year, that's probably the high point of any quarter in the history of the F-35 program. And that's to say that that's what we expect eventually to become sort of standard practice as that will be a double-digit program going forward just as F-16, F22, C-130s and you name the program are. First quarter of 2016 is a little less than 2015 but not much less. We still have good performance, and you should think of that as even though the step-ups were lower, sort of the run rate of the program is higher. And therefore, it's almost comparable but not quite to what we performed in 2016 -- excuse me, in 2015 in the first quarter compared to 2016. Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I've lost track now who asked it, but our expectation is we still do expect to have margin improvement on the entire program, including the development contract. But the total F-35 program this year, in total, is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015. So again, nice progression, not quite as high as the 100 basis points we talked last year but still progressing nicely and sort of in line with what I said all along, which is double-digit by the end by the time we get to full rate production."

And let me just give you, hopefully, a thoughtful answer to your question there. So the challenges that we have on the development program are surely winding down as we're progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the -- I'll say the impacts that might result -- your question sort of tallied what's going on with the concurrency changes that impact the development program stretched out. Most of the structural types of testing that could result in, I'll say, large concurrency changes, we should have a really, really good idea of where those are, probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year as we complete sort of the testing and the multiple useful life testing of all 3 variants. We're -- I've lost track off the top of my head where we are progressing on that, but all 3 variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability, and we're in 150% of useful life and beyond, I believe, for where we are in the testing of that. So most of the structural items, I would say I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some relative -- some software changes that come out of it relative to some testing and particularly some of the testing later in the development program that might result in some software changes. I don't typically view those as concurrency issues. We're still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year. We're making really good progress on the software to accomplish that. The Alice program is probably the other thing that we all have our eyes on in terms of this is the sustainment vehicle that, sort of, is your one-stop shop for sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we're doing there is high on our list of things to be mindful of, but I think that's still going to support the IOC and whatever that's scheduled in the fourth quarter or so of this year. I'll remind you the development contract is still cost reimbursable, and I know your question is more in the concurrency, but we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably once we get past these testings the latter part of this year and to early 2017."

I'll let Marillyn chime in, Myles, but I think I've said publicly, once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort of  re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think, organically going forward, you should expect this to have about 3% to 5% growth heavily driven, obviously, by the F-35 program and Aeronautics, in general. Also contributing to that is across all the business areas it may not be self evident because we've actually got some DoD contractions in some of the business areas there, but our international growth is probably going to grow from 21% or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not-too-distant future. So that's helping fuel that growth as well. As far as the reductions, I would say that's not because of pressure that's being put on us from a DoD perspective. There is -- if you just think of the life cycle and it goes back little bit to Seth's question there, the development program is winding down, the production program is going leaps and bounds year-over-year, and so the workforce is sort of transitioning more from sort of an engineering-dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing-based workforce, and we're starting to see that transition occur. And that's what some of these reductions are for, simply the lower level of the development program going down and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the manufacturing growth as what we saw in the development programs, if that makes sense."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We are pleased to have you with us as we review our first quarter results and full year outlook for 2016.
As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, financially and operationally. The corporation continued to perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders.
I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including an update on our Sikorsky activities as well as the current status of the strategic disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos.
Turning to the quarter, our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, with achievement of first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year.
Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts.
One of the standout items in our financial results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash generation is a financial hallmark of our corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. I would also note that share repurchases year-to-date have reduced the outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares. This lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017.
This long-standing goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by stock exchange contained in the deal transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our corporation at deal closure also provides cash deployment and share reduction opportunity.
With the full year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my high-level perspectives on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes, procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the integration process. We continue to see cost reduction and efficiency opportunities emerging, as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas like supply chain, where multiple business areas procure similar materials, have allowed us to look at where we can realize better buying power and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved, and we will -- and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this acquisition.
Moving to an operational perspective, significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight test program and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase.
Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the U.S. Navy for long-lead items required for the first 2 CH-53K helicopters on Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 1. These initial units are part of the naval aviation procurement plan to field 200 helicopters on the program in coming years.
In the area of commercial helicopters, we are seeing some emerging interests from other consumers beyond the oil and gas sector for S-92 platforms. And we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and international military segments.
We also see significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in sustainment. To pursue this area, we recently opened a state-of-the-art customer care center in Connecticut that is designed to enhance platform reliability and ensure 24-hour availability to customers' aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term creation of the rotary aircraft business to customers around the world.
Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area. Key events associated with the pending strategic disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United Kingdom. We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing and a comparable filing by Leidos initiate a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed Martin stockholders.
Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Overall, the program continues to progress on satisfying remaining development activities while also ramping up the production rate. Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter and included completion of the first transatlantic F-35 flight from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the U.S., to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots, surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations. And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve initial operation capability of CTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC scheduled later this year.
I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this quarter by our Aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we remain agile and competitive in our cost structure. In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses implemented voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions. While these reductions resulted in special severance charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business opportunities with a leaner cost structure.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."

As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.",671,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion, slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $2.58, which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with planned headcount reductions. We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better-than-expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of about MST for about $1 billion. And more than $600 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by about $400 million in higher F-35 production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries.
Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results include the severance charges for reductions in Aeronautics and IS&GS as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from operations and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash returned to shareholders was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter, we are right on track to our planned level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.
If you turn to chart 6, we'll provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter, we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We are increasing our sales outlook by $100 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter. We're increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share, and I'll discuss that in greater detail on the next chart. And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million, consistent with our improved profit outlook.
Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook, the $125 million increase in segment operating profit results in a $0.26 increase in EPS, while the $100 million special charges associated with our severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart.
On Chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the sales ranges for the other core business areas at this time.
Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit outlook in 4 of our 5 business areas with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each, while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million. 
And finally, on Chart 10, we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share in cash from operations. We continue to provide significant tax returns to our stockholders, and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year.
With that, we're ready for questions, Abigail."

I think, we had $190 million increase in sales and about a $10 million or so increase in profits what we called out, I think, on the earnings release. This is somewhat what I talked about, I think, either in October or January where we're sort of finishing kind of an older, I'd say multiyear contract. It's more than a multiyear contract, but a -- an older contract of C-130s that we performed well on, and it's at the tail end of that contract. And we're starting off with sort of the new deliveries and new performance on the new multiyear contract that was just negotiated. So some of that is sort of the resetting, in my words, of the profits, initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As I've said, all along, I still think the economics between the 2 contracts are very similar. But as our sort of historical practice, we're starting that program a little lower than we ended the last program for C-130s, if that makes sense. On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you're right. We did not increase for the year. We're watching that closely. I'll just leave it that. As we sit here in the first quarter, didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is some upside opportunity. We've seen some good signs, particularly, as you said, Carter, in some of the consumables, particularly in some of our Middle East customers. But I'm watching this to see if it's perhaps somewhat something later on in the year, but not at this time."

We should think of, essentially, all the international orders for both PAC-3 missiles as well as the Fed program or sort of combined with U.S. orders. So they'll perform essentially at parity with U.S. orders over that period of time. There's not, per se, any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the U.S. military portion of the order, if you will. And this again, is somewhat a kind of what I talked about just now in the C-130 where we have sort of a shifting from an older contract, where we closed out a good performing contract and a newly negotiated contract, where we're starting off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make. And that's exactly what's going on in both the PAC-3 and Fed programs as we've negotiated some new contracts, and they're starting off slightly lower margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up. Again economically, I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference between the contracts but sort of from a booking perspective, that's the way that's pulling out, but I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk that we have associated with those deliveries."

I think from a big picture perspective, we do expect them to increase sequentially year-over-year. We talked about last year being an expectation of 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program. We achieved that. I think I talked about, again either October or January, the fact that we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016 than 2015. We still expect that, although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015. And we would expect that trend to continue in '17 and '18, as we start to sort of progress to what you're describing, Rich, which is our ultimate expectation, which is by the time we get full rate production, the margins on the F-35 probably look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its life cycle as F-16 margins, F-22 margins, C-130, et cetera. So I don't think that we're deviating from that expectation. Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we had probably slightly higher pickups on the production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step-ups on production contracts this quarter as well. If I look at last year's first quarter results, I know I didn't talk about this last year. We were actually close to 10% on the production program. So it will sort of peak and valley depending on the step-ups and when they occur and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter. But our expectation, again, is we'll get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production. Your second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated at pretty comparable margin levels as the production programs. So it's not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is growing fairly rapidly. We're going to start seeing some of the sustainment contracts, sort of split out of the production contracts as this volume gets bigger. So we may in the future end up talk about sustainment separately from production, but you shouldn't think of that as being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point."

So I don't think Sikorsky -- we're still early into the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results. So I'm still getting my head around describing Sikorsky and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That's both from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective or an EBIT perspective. We're sort of front-end-loaded during the year with these things I talked about in last quarter's call, these customer lean rights that sort of depressed the sales because of sales or products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That plays out sort of to -- for the most part in the first half of this year. So we would expect to see sort of sequential growth in sales at Sikorsky quarter-over-quarter with the fourth quarter, obviously, being the highest quarter of the year. Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increase quarter-over-quarter. Again, obviously, having the fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well, and this is again some of the timing of the customer lean rights in the first half of the year as well. So I'd say just big picture, that's pretty much in line with what we expected to happen in the first quarter. We're going to watch it throughout the year, and we'll give you updates as we grow and progress through the rest of the year. Secondly, Joe, you asked the question about 2018 pension funding, so we have described several years ago our expectation that we were going to have a 3-year pension holiday, cash funding holiday, as I called it, I think. And that was 2015, '16, and '17. And unfortunately, that holiday does stop at the end of 2017. And in 2018, we would expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think, as we sit here today, Joe, that's probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so. But importantly, I think you shouldn't think of that as necessarily being sort of taking the current run rate of cash and subtracting, so say, $5 billion and subtracting $1.5 billion and we're down to $3.5 billion. We expect by 2018 to have a much greater cash from the Sikorsky acquisition as well as cash from the other business areas that's going to offset most, but not all, that pension contribution. And we also get a tax benefit of that as well. So we get a cash tax benefit associated with that. So it's somewhat mitigated in 2018, so you shouldn't think sort of as falling off the cliff from 2017."

And I'll say, I mean, obviously, we increased the outlook for both sales and profit, so it's exceeded our expectations. I think there's a couple of things going on, and some of them are a little subtle. So sales is just -- this is a tough business to sort of predict, what's -- which competitions are you going to win, which ones are you going to not win. And you get scenarios where things get protested even if you lose and therefore you can actually get the sales stretched out of those. We're sort of seeing all those happen at the same time. So one thing I'm really pleased with, probably more than anything even higher than sort of the sales volume because, again, it gets a little bit hard to call is the better-than-expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write-off on an international contract. And even with that write-off, we still exceeded our expectations, and we still, as obviously, we said earlier increased our guidance for the year. I think that's sort of due to 3 reasons that at least as I look at sort of big picture-wise. One, we had expected a number of recompete activities to occur on some of our larger contracts in the year. And these -- we bid those probably more aggressive than the previous contract where we were the incumbent, and because these contracts are actually being protested, we are continuing the performance on the older contracts, which are at the higher margin on the incumbent contracts. So it's good for us from both the sales perspective, and more importantly, on the margin side because of that. I think we also had better performance on sort of the closeout or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time, and we're actually performing very, very well on those transition periods. And then taking some cost out as we end the program higher than our expectations, which are resulting in higher margins. And then the third thing, I would just say, is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team and, I think, credit goes to that team.

First of all, I just want to build on what Bruce said. I mean, this is a management team that's running a business. They've outlined some commitments for the year, and they're performing the commitments and the whole -- entire team in IS&GS is making sure that their cost structure is in line with the business base that they have. So as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in, it's ultracompetitive. And it's an area that you've got to constantly be watching your cost, and you have to manage to that. There's close coordination with Leidos as they make headcount reductions. Certainly, we have an agreement as we're going through this process to closing the transaction. So actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side, they are aware that we're going to take those kinds of actions. But it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on the business. It's in all of our best interest, and we will continue to do that with an excellent team that's working that every day."

But none of them that will play out, I think, by the time we get to the end of the second quarter. I think we'll be back on track at the end of the second quarter. And we're very much on track to have the 53 aircraft that we talked about in the first quarter -- or the last call in January, excuse me, delivered for the year. So no issue there. So it was just sort of the transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side, there is no issue. There is more of a, I'll say, not quite administrative but not a production issue there. You talked about Sikorsky within MST, and guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That's what we're showing, David, in the outlook there. And even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings perspective with MST, that's one that we're watching closely. It's a little early in the year to go more than that, but I think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we've got on the table right now. If you just do the math the way you did it, David, with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the 3 quarters of the year, you would kind of come to that conclusion, I think, as well. And then lastly, the -- I think the Sikorsky, you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS. So all this has to do with the share reduction from the Reverse Morris Trust transaction and expectation of some of the bleed-off of the transition costs or transaction costs including the integration. That's still our expectation, David, is that we'll be neutral going into 2017 with all the pluses and minuses going into that."

Even though it's down, that was not down as much as what our plan had suggested it might be. An interesting thing we're going to have, probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year or at least as we see it or the orders that this year were probably not going to have as large a fourth quarter from an orders perspective as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year, and that's sort of the planning and the biggest single ticket item there is the definitization or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35, and that's worth a significant amount of money. Depending on when that happens and when IS&GS is dispositioned, we could actually see potentially $100 billion worth of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS' disposition. And if I was to pick a number, it's probably going to be somewhere between 90 and -- low 90s to $95 billion, excuse me, by year-end as the expectation. We were sort of expecting at about a -- almost $4.5 million or so $5 billion drop steady run rate with IS&GS in the mix and when you take out IS&GS it gets down to that $90-ish billion level."

It could potentially delay. I think it's not an indication they're not going to buy it. To me, it's just a matter of them balancing their -- with pressure on their budgets with oil prices balancing what they can buy. And I think that we'll see probably some of that, maybe it will impact some volumes or delays and some orders. But the bottom line is, you know the conflict in that region, you know the challenges they have from a global security standpoint. And because they have increased security responsibility since the U.S. is not so prevalent there, they're having to step up and buy the things that we need -- that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued demand. It's just a matter of maybe some things will slip. That's not unusual in the international marketplace even on a good day. I mean we don't always see things come right online with what we anticipate anyway because as they -- as they're dealing with multiple procurements, they may have to do it more serially sometimes and get one out of the way before they move onto the next.

We actually expect ULA's earnings will be higher in 2016 than 2015. That's actually the primary reason behind the guidance increase and space systems is, in fact, because we do have a higher expectation of ULA. The severance charges that we're taking on ULA, I don't think you'll see much impact of that in the numbers, and that's just a little bit of -- you've got the severance costs offset by the lower cost once the people are removed, and that will, I think, at least in 2016 be somewhat neutral for the year. It's a little too early for me to call 2017, but that's the expectation for 2016. Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that, Sam, and we actually had -- and Marillyn can comment on this as well, obviously, but we actually had a lot of discussions with the board and our compensation committee. And the concern was that because orders are so variable, I mean a perfect example perhaps is you can imagine a scenario where we had won the bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you give actually someone credit for having won it or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home? I mean these are some of the real live conversations that we had, and we ultimately decided that the sales, earnings and cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of awards. I'll remind you also that we do have an incentive compensation metric associated with focused programs and the thought was, as long as we win the right programs, I mean, whether or not -- I'll make this up, whether or not the fiscal year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January, it's probably not as important as winning some of our critical competitions. And so we decided to sort of focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they happen again end of this year or beginning of next year."

Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I've lost track now who asked it, but the -- our expectation is we still do expect to have margin improvement on the entire program, including the development contract. But the total F-35 program this year, in total, is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015.

So the challenges that we have on the development program are surely winding down as we're progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the -- I'll say the impacts that might result -- your question sort of tallied what's going on with the concurrency changes that impact the development program stretched out. Most of the structural types of testing that could result in, I'll say, large concurrency changes, we should have a really, really good idea of where those are, probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year as we complete sort of the fatigue testing and the multiple useful life testing of all 3 variants. We're -- I've lost track off the top of my head where we are in progressing on that, but all 3 variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability. And we're in 150% of useful life and beyond, I believe, for where we are in the testing of that. So most of the structural items, I would say I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some  relative to some software changes that come out of it, relative to some testing and particularly some of the [indiscernible] testing later in the developmental program that might result in some software changes. I don't typically view those as sort of concurrency issues. We're still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year. We're making really good progress on the software to accomplish that. The Alice program is probably the other thing that we all have our eyes on in terms of this is the sustainment vehicle that, sort of, is your one-stop shop for sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we're doing there is high on our list of things to be mindful of, but I think that's still going to support the IOC and whatever that's scheduled, the fourth quarter or so of this year. I'll remind you the development contract is still cost reimbursable, and I know your question is more on the concurrency, but we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably once we get past these testings the latter part of this year and to early 2017."

I'll let Marillyn chime in, Myles, but -- so I think I've said publicly, once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort of  re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think, organically going forward, you should expect us to head about 3% to 5% growth heavily driven, obviously, by the F-35 program and Aeronautics, in general. Also contributing to that is across all the business areas it may not be self-evident because we've actually got some DoD contractions in some of the business areas there, but our international growth is probably going to grow from 21% or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not-too-distant future. So that's helping fuel that growth as well. As far as the reductions, I would say that's not because of pressure that's being put on us from a DoD perspective. There is -- if you just think of the life cycle and it goes back a little bit to Seth's question there, the development program is winding down, the production program is going leaps and bounds year-over-year. And so the workforce is sort of transitioning more from sort of an engineering-dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing-based workforce. And we're starting to see that transition occur. And that's what some of these reductions are for, simply the lower level of or sort of the development program going down and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the manufacturing growth as what we saw on the development programs, if that makes sense."

Yes, we talked about that India is looking at their taxable fighter competition, and we are in there with an offer to move our production line to India. In terms of the mark, the most recent mark that came out of the [indiscernible], the defense bill, they have -- as you have seen have added 11 aircraft for the F-35. We -- and so we saw an increase last year in FY '16 on the buzz and so it seem that coming forward as important. There are, also, a lot of our programs are well supported, just in the budget itself. And then with potential ads as they look at additional opportunities. On the F-22, I know there's been some discussion about a restart on the F-22, and we just stand ready to support with whatever information we're asked to provide. You're probably aware that the 2 guys still exist. And so there will be -- as most programs you start one from a cold start I'm sure that they really want to understand the cost associated with a cold start, but at the same time you wouldn't want to build the same aircraft, so you'll do some upgrades to that aircraft, modernize it, and some of the design incorporate some of the things that we've learned through F-35 and other programs that you could incorporate into that. So we'll stand ready to support that. But bottom line is, I think, our programs are well supported in the present budget submission. And then I think the markets going through would potentially add some additional ones for us. And we know there's a long way to go on the budget process, it's early days in getting through that. So we remain hopeful that with our programs, they're really lined up with the department strategic priorities that they will continue to be well supported."

I don't have the numbers exactly to memory, Cai. But somewhere in that range 3/4, 1/4 or so. As I said earlier and I think I was talking to Myles on the question on the headcount reduction in Aeronautics most of these are salaried folks. As Marillyn said, some of the indirect support required is no longer going to be required to support sort of the production ramp rate that was required to support some of the developmental work that we were doing. Importantly, I think, a big piece of the Aeronautics reduction was actually a voluntary reduction. And I think we actually got about what we were expecting as a result of that voluntary reductions, so we were pleased with that, that people -- that it came with very few, I'll say, involuntary reductions. So I think that's a good thing as well. And then as far as the recovery of this year or not -- that's still playing out, Cai, we're trying -- I mean, I think in big picture terms that you should expect to see a somewhat neutral reaction in 2016. And there may be some benefit as depending on what the timing is of the reductions or the severance charges as they play out that may carry on in 2017. We'll watch that closely and monitor that as we go through the next 3 quarters to see if there is an impact in 2016. But if there is, we'll surely tell you about it.

We are pleased to have you with us as we review our first quarter results and full year outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, financially and operationally. The corporation continued to perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including an update on our Sikorsky activities as well as the current status of the strategic disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos.
Turning to the quarter, our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, with achievement of first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts.
One of the standout items in our financial results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash generation is a financial hallmark of our corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. I would also note that share repurchases year-to-date have reduced the outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares. This lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017.
This long-standing goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by stock exchange contained in the deal transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our corporation at deal closure also provides cash deployment and share reduction opportunity.
With the full year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my high-level perspectives on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes, procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the integration process. We continue to see cost reduction and efficiency opportunities emerging, as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas like supply chain, where multiple business areas procure similar materials, have allowed us to look at where we can realize better buying power and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved, and we will -- and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this acquisition.
Moving to an operational perspective, significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight test program and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase. Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the U.S. Navy for long-lead items required for the first 2 CH-53K helicopters on Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 1. These initial units are part of the naval aviation procurement plan to field 200 helicopters on the program in coming years.
In the area of commercial helicopters, we are seeing some emerging interest from other consumers beyond the oil and gas sector for S-92 platforms. And we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and international military segments. We also see significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in sustainment. To pursue this area, we recently opened a state-of-the-art customer care center in Connecticut that is designed to enhance platform reliability and ensure 24-hour availability to customers' aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term creation of the rotary aircraft business to customers around the world.
Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area. Key events associated with the pending strategic disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United Kingdom. We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing and a comparable filing by Leidos initiate a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed Martin stockholders.
Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Overall, the program continues to progress on satisfying remaining development activities while also ramping up the production rate. Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter and included completion of the first transatlantic F-35 flight from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the U.S., to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots, surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations. And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve initial operation capability of CTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC scheduled later this year.
I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this quarter by our Aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we remain agile and competitive in our cost structure. In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses implemented voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions. While these reductions resulted in special severance charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business opportunities with a leaner cost structure.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."

As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.",670,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion, slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $2.58, which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with planned headcount reductions. We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better-than-expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of about MST for about $1 billion and more than $600 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by about $400 million in higher F-35 production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries. Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results include the severance charges for reductions in Aeronautics and IS&GS as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustment and integration costs.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from operations and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash returned to shareholders was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter, we are right on track to our planned level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter, we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We're increasing our sales outlook by $100 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter. We're increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share, and I'll discuss that in greater detail on the next chart. And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million, consistent with our improved profit outlook.
Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit results in a $0.26 increase in EPS, while the $100 million special charge associated with our severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart.
On Chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the sales ranges for the other core business areas at this time.
Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit outlook in 4 of our 5 business areas with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each, while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million. 
And finally, on Chart 10, we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share in cash from operations. We continue to provide significant tax returns to our stockholders, and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year.
With that, we're ready for questions, Abigail."

So the first one, I think, was your margin contribution question relative to C-130, and you picked that right. I think, we had $190 million increase in sales and about a $10 million or so increase in profits what we called out, I think, on the earnings release. This is somewhat of what I talked about, I think, either in October or January where we're sort of finishing kind of an older, I'd say multiyear contract. It's more than a multiyear contract, but a -- an older contract of C-130s that we performed well on, and it's at the tail end of that contract. And we're starting off with sort of the new deliveries and new performance on the new multiyear contract that was just negotiated. So some of that is sort of the resetting, in my words, of the profits, initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As I've said, all along, I still think the economics between the 2 contracts are very similar. But as is our sort of historical practice, we're starting that program a little lower than we ended the last program for C-130s, if that makes sense. On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you're right. We did not increase for the year. We're watching that closely. I'll just leave it that. As we sit here in the first quarter, didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is some upside opportunity. We've seen some good signs, particularly, as you said, Carter, in some of the consumables, particularly in -- with some of our Middle East customers. But I'm watching this to see if it's perhaps somewhat something later on in the year, but not at this time."

So I think the watch item in terms of the air missile defense programs for the Middle East are more in the orders expectation for this year rather than, I'll say, the margin expectations. I mean you should think of, essentially, all the international orders for both PAC-3 missiles as well as the THAAD program or sort of combined with U.S. orders. So they'll perform essentially at parity with U.S. orders over that period of time. There's not, per se, any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the U.S. military portion of the order, if you will. And this again, is somewhat a kind of what I talked about just now in the C-130 where we have sort of a shifting from an older contract, where we closed out a good performing contract and a newly negotiated contract, where we're starting off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make. And that's exactly what's going on in both the PAC-3 and THAAD programs as we've negotiated some new contracts, and they're starting off slightly lower margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up. Again economically, I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference between the contracts but sort of from a booking perspective, that's the way that's pulling out, but I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk that we have associated with those deliveries."

I think from a big picture perspective, we do expect them to increase sequentially year-over-year. We talked about last year being an expectation of 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program. We achieved that. I think I talked about, again either October or January, the fact that we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016 than 2015. We still expect that, although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015. And we would expect that trend to continue in '17 and '18, as we start to sort of progress to what you're describing, Rich, which is our ultimate expectation, which is by the time we get to full rate production, the margins on the F-35 probably look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its life cycle as F-16 margins, F-22 margins, C-130, et cetera. So I don't think that we're deviating from that expectation. Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we had probably slightly higher pickups on the production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step-ups on production contracts this quarter as well. If I look at last year's first quarter results, I know I didn't talk about this last year. We were actually close to 10% on the production program. So it will sort of peak and valley depending on the step-ups and when they occur and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter. But our expectation, again, is we'll get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production. Your second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated at pretty comparable margin levels as the production programs. So it's not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is growing fairly rapidly. And we're going to start seeing some of the sustainment contracts, sort of split out of the production contracts as this volume gets bigger. So we may in the future end up talk about sustainment separately from production, but you shouldn't think of that as being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point."

So I would say Sikorsky -- and look, we're still early into the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results. So I'm still getting my head around describing Sikorsky and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That's both from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective or an EBIT perspective. We're sort of front-end-loaded during the year with these things I talked about in last quarter's call, these customer lien rights that sort of depressed the sales because of sales or products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That plays out sort of to -- for the most part in the first half of this year. So we would expect to see sort of sequential growth in sales at Sikorsky quarter-over-quarter with the fourth quarter, obviously, being the highest quarter of the year. Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increase quarter-over-quarter. Again, obviously, having the fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well, and this is again some of the timing of the customer lien rights in the first half of the year as well. So I'd say just big picture, that's pretty much in line with what we expected to happen in the first quarter. And we're going to watch it throughout the year, and we'll give you updates as we go and progress through the rest of the year. Secondly, Joe, you asked the question about 2018 pension funding, so we have described several years ago our expectation that we were going to have a 3-year pension holiday, cash funding holiday, as I called it, I think. And that was 2015, '16, and '17. And unfortunately, that holiday does stop at the end of 2017. And in 2018, we would expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think, as we sit here today, Joe, that's probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so. But importantly, I think you shouldn't think of that as necessarily being sort of taking the current run rate of cash and subtracting, so say $5 billion and subtracting $1.5 billion and we're down to $3.5 billion. We expect by 2018 to have a much greater cash from the Sikorsky acquisition as well as cash from the other business areas that's going to offset most, but not all, of that pension contribution. And we also get a tax benefit of that as well. So we get a cash tax benefit associated with that. So it's somewhat mitigated in 2018, so you shouldn't think sort of as falling off the cliff from 2017."

And I'll say, I mean, obviously, we increased the outlook for both sales and profit, so it's exceeded our expectations. I think there's a couple of things going on, and so",478,"So Rob, let me take the first part of that question, sort of the IS&GS performance. And I'll say, I mean, obviously, we increased the outlook for both sales and profit, so it's exceeded our expectations. I think there's a couple of things going on, and some of them are a little subtle. So sales is just -- this is a tough business to sort of predict, what's -- which competitions are you going to win, which ones are you going to not win. And you get scenarios where things get protested even if you lose and therefore you can actually get the sales stretch out of those. We're sort of seeing all those happen at the same time. So one thing I'm really pleased with, probably more than anything even higher than sort of the sales volume because, again, it gets a little bit hard to call is the better-than-expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write-off on an international contract. And even with that write-off, we still exceeded our expectations, and we still, as obviously, we said earlier increased our guidance for the year. I think that's sort of due to 3 reasons that at least as I look at sort of big picture-wise. One, we had expected a number of recompete activities to occur on some of our larger contracts in the year. And these -- we bid those probably more aggressive than the previous contract where we were the incumbent. And because these contracts are actually being protested, we are continuing the performance on the older contracts, which are at the, if you will, the higher margin on the incumbent contracts. So it's good for us from both the sales perspective, and more importantly, on the margin side because of that. I think we also had better performance on sort of the closeout or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time, and we're actually performing very, very well on those transition periods. And then taking some cost out as we end the program higher than our expectations, which are resulting in higher margins. And then the third thing, I would just say, is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team and, I think, credit goes to that team. I think it's indicative of the fact that they haven't taken their eyes off the ball. It's a well-run organization, and the entire team understands that the mission that they performed for their customers is important, no matter who they work for. And I think we're seeing that play out live in person in front of us here. I'll ask Marillyn to answer the other question you asked, Rob."

I'll pick up on the second part where you ask about at the time of transaction how to think about some of the puts and takes in the headcount and how we think about that. First one, just want to build on what Bruce said. I mean, this is a management team that's running a business. They've outlined some commitments for the year, and they're performing the commitments and the whole entire team in IS&GS is making sure that their cost structure is in line with the business base that they have. So as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in, it's ultracompetitive. And it's an area that you've got to constantly be watching your cost, and you have to manage to that. There's close coordination with Leidos as they make headcount reductions. Certainly, we have an agreement as we were going through this process to closing the transaction. So actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side, they are aware that we're going to take those kinds of actions. But it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on the business. It's in all of our best interest, and we will continue to do that with an excellent team that's working that every day."

And we're very much on track to have the 53 aircraft that we talked about in the first quarter -- or the last call in January, excuse me, delivered for the year. So no issue there. So it was just sort of the transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side, there is no issue. There is more of a, I'll say, not quite administrative but not a production issue there. You talked about Sikorsky within MST, and guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That's what we're showing, David, in the outlook there. And even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings perspective with MST, that's one that we're watching closely. It's a little early in the year to go more than that, but I think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we've got on the table right now. If you just do the math the way you did it, David, with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the 3 quarters of the year, you would kind of come to that conclusion, I think, as well. And then lastly, the -- I think the Sikorsky, you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS. So all this has to do with the share reduction from the Reverse Morris Trust transaction and expectation of some of the bleed-off of the transition costs or transaction costs including the integration. That's still our expectation, David, is that'll be neutral going into 2017 with all the pluses and minuses going into that."

So that was -- that may not be apparent, even though it was down, that was not down as much as what our plan had suggested it might be. An interesting thing we're going to have, probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year or at least as we see it or the orders that this year were probably not going to have as large a fourth quarter from an orders perspective as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year, and that's sort of the planning and the biggest single ticket item there is the definitization or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35, and that's worth a significant amount of money. Depending on when that happens and when IS&GS is dispositioned, we can actually see potentially $100 billion worth of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS' disposition. And if I was to pick a number, it's probably going to be somewhere between 90 and -- low 90s to $95 billion, excuse me, by year-end as the expectation. We were sort of expecting at about a -- almost $4.5 million or so, $5 billion drop steady run rate with IS&GS in the mix and when you take out IS&GS it gets down to that $90-ish billion level."

It could potentially delay. I think it's not an indication they're not going to buy it. To me, it's just a matter of them balancing their -- with pressure on their budgets with oil prices balancing what they can buy. And I think that we'll see probably some of that, maybe it'll impact some volumes or delays in some orders. But the bottom line is, you know the conflict in that region, you know the challenges they have from a global security standpoint. And because they have increased security responsibility since the U.S. is not so prevalent there, they're having to step up and buy the things that we need -- that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued demand. It's just a matter of maybe some things will slip. That's not unusual in the international marketplace even on a good day.

Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that, Sam, and we actually had -- and Marillyn can comment on this as well, obviously, but we actually had a lot of discussions with the board and our compensation committee. And the concern was that because orders are so variable, I mean a perfect example perhaps is you can imagine a scenario where we had won the bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you give actually someone credit for having won it or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home? I mean these are some of the real live conversations that we had, and we ultimately decided that the sales, earnings and cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of awards. I'll remind you also that we do have an incentive compensation metric associated with focus programs. And the thought was, as long as we win the right programs, I mean, whether or not -- I'll make this up, whether or not the fiscal year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January, it's probably not as important as winning some of our critical competitions. And so we decided to sort of focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they happen again end of this year or beginning of next year."

I mean the reason I highlighted the first quarter of last year, that's probably the high point of any quarter in the history of the F-35 program. And that's to say that that's what we expect eventually to become sort of standard practice as that will be a double-digit program going forward just as F-16s, F-22s, C-130s and you name the program are. First quarter of 2016 is a little less than 2015 but not much less. We still have good performance, and you should think of that as even though the step-ups were lower, the -- sort of the run rate of the programs is higher. And therefore, it's almost comparable but not quite to what we performed in 2016 -- or excuse me, in 2015 in the first quarter compared to 2016. Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I've lost track now who asked it, but the -- our expectation is we still do expect to have margin improvement on the entire program, including the development contract. But the total F-35 program this year, in total, is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015. So again, nice progression, not quite as high as the 100 basis points we talked last year but still progressing nicely and sort of in line with what I've said all along, which is double-digit by the time we get to full rate production."

So when you think about those challenges, which we read about fairly often, if the development portion of the program was to become extended, let's say, into 2018, in terms of financial implications, I'm guessing they're fairly -- there's fairly little exposure to you. But are there concurrency implications to that or, for example, if there are issues that delay the program further, is the exposure for you sort of in going back into and making upgrades to aircraft? And could you talk about how much we should be concerned about that, if at all?"

And let me just give you, hopefully, a thoughtful answer to your question there. So the challenges that we have on the development program are surely winding down as we're progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the -- I'll say the impacts that might result -- your question sort of tallied what's going on with the concurrency changes if in fact the development program stretched out. Most of the structural types of testing that could result in, I'll say, large concurrency changes, we should have a really, really good idea of where those are, probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year as we complete sort of the fatigue testing and the multiple useful life testing of all 3 variants. We're -- I've lost track off the top of my head where we are in progressing on that, but all 3 variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability. And we're in 150% of useful life and beyond, I believe, for where we are in the testing of that. So most of the structural items, I would say I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some  relative to some software changes that come out of it, relative to some testing and particularly some of the armament testing later in the developmental program that might result in some software changes. I don't typically view those as sort of concurrency issues. We're still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year. We're making really good progress on the software to accomplish that. The ALIS program is probably the other thing that we all have our eyes on in terms of this is the sustainment vehicle that, sort of, is your one-stop shop for sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we're doing there is high on our list of things to be mindful of, but I think that's still going to support the IOC and whenever that's scheduled, the fourth quarter or so of this year. I'll remind you the development contract is still cost reimbursable, and I know your question is more on the concurrency, but we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably once we get past these testings the latter part of this year and to early 2017."

I'll let Marillyn chime in, Myles. But -- so I think I've said publicly, once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort of  re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think, organically going forward, you should expect us to have about 3% to 5% growth heavily driven, obviously, by the F-35 program and Aeronautics, in general. Also contributing to that is across all the business areas it may not be self-evident because we've actually got some DoD contractions in some of the business areas there, but our international growth is probably going to grow from 21% or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not-too-distant future. So that's helping fuel that growth as well. As far as the reductions, I would say that's not because of pressure that's being put on us from a DoD perspective. There is -- if you just think of the life cycle and it goes back a little bit to Seth's question there, the development program is winding down, the production program is going leaps and bounds year-over-year. And so the workforce is sort of transitioning more from sort of an engineering-dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing-based workforce. And we're starting to see that transition occur. And that's what some of these reductions are for, is simply the lower level of or sort of the development program going down and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the manufacturing growth as what we saw on the development programs, if that makes sense."

And then with potential adds as they look at additional opportunities. On the F-22, I know there's been some discussion about a restart on the F-22, and we just stand ready to support with whatever information we're asked to provide. You're probably aware that the 2 guys still exist. And so there will be -- as most programs you start one from a cold start I'm sure that they really want to understand the cost associated with a cold start, but at the same time you wouldn't want to build the same aircraft, so you'll do some upgrades to that aircraft, modernize it, and some of the design -- incorporate some of the things that we've learned through F-35 and other programs that you could incorporate into that. So we'll stand ready to support that. But bottom line is, I think, our programs are well supported in the present budget submission. And then I think the markets going through would potentially add some additional ones for us. And we know there's a long way to go on the budget process, it's early days in getting through that. So we remain hopeful that with our programs, they're really line up with the department strategic priorities that they will continue to be well supported."

I don't have the numbers exactly to memory, Cai. But somewhere in that range 3/4, 1/4 or so. As I said earlier and I think I was talking to Myles on the question on the headcount reduction in Aeronautics most of these are salaried folks. As Marillyn said, some of the indirect support required to -- that's no longer going to be required to support sort of the production ramp rate that was required to support some of the developmental work that we were doing. Importantly, I think, a big piece of the Aeronautics reduction was actually a voluntary reduction. And I think we actually got about what we were expecting as a result of that voluntary reduction, so we were pleased with that, that people -- that it came with very few, I'll say, involuntary reductions. So I think that's a good thing as well. And then as far as the recovery of this year or not, that's still playing out, Cai. We're trying -- I mean, I think in big picture terms that you should expect to see a somewhat neutral reaction in 2016. And there may be some benefit as depending on what the timing is of the reductions or the severance charges as they play out that may carry on in 2017.

We are pleased to have you with us as we review our first quarter results and full year outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, financially and operationally. The corporation continued to perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including an update on our Sikorsky activities as well as the current status of the strategic disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos.
Turning to the quarter, our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, with achievement of first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts.
One of the standout items in our financial results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash generation is a financial hallmark of our corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. I would also note that share repurchases year-to-date have reduced the outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares. This lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017.
This long-standing goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by stock exchange contained in the deal transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our corporation at deal closure also provides cash deployment and share reduction opportunity.
With the full year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my high-level perspectives on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes, procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the integration process. We continue to see cost reduction and efficiency opportunities emerging, as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas like supply chain, where multiple business areas procure similar materials, have allowed us to look at where we can realize better buying power and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved, and we will -- and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this acquisition.
Moving to an operational perspective, significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight test program and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase. Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the U.S. Navy for long-lead items required for the first 2 CH-53K helicopters on Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 1. These initial units are part of the naval aviation procurement plan to field 200 helicopters on the program in coming years.
In the area of commercial helicopters, we are seeing some emerging interest from other consumers beyond the oil and gas sector for S-92 platforms. And we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and international military segments. We also see significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in sustainment. To pursue this area, we recently opened a state-of-the-art customer care center in Connecticut that is designed to enhance platform reliability and ensure 24-hour availability to customers' aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term creation of the rotary aircraft business to customers around the world.
Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area. Key events associated with the pending strategic disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United Kingdom. We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing and a comparable filing by Leidos initiate a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed Martin stockholders.
Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Overall, the program continues to progress on satisfying remaining development activities while also ramping up the production rate. Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter and included completion of the first transatlantic F-35 flight from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the U.S., to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots, surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations. And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve initial operation capability of CTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC scheduled later this year.
I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this quarter by our Aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we remain agile and competitive in our cost structure. In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses implemented voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions. While these reductions resulted in special severance charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business opportunities with a leaner cost structure.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."

As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.",670,"Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion, slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $2.58, which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with planned headcount reductions. We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better-than-expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of about MST for about $1 billion and more than $600 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by about $400 million in higher F-35 production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries. Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results include the severance charges for reductions in Aeronautics and IS&GS as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustment and integration costs.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from operations and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash returned to shareholders was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter, we are right on track to our planned level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter, we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We're increasing our sales outlook by $100 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter. We're increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share, and I'll discuss that in greater detail on the next chart. And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million, consistent with our improved profit outlook.
Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit results in a $0.26 increase in EPS, while the $100 million special charge associated with our severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart.
On Chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the sales ranges for the other core business areas at this time.
Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit outlook in 4 of our 5 business areas with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each, while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million. 
And finally, on Chart 10, we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share in cash from operations. We continue to provide significant tax returns to our stockholders, and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year.
With that, we're ready for questions, Abigail."

So the first one, I think, was your margin contribution question relative to C-130, and you picked that right. I think, we had $190 million increase in sales and about a $10 million or so increase in profits what we called out, I think, on the earnings release. This is somewhat of what I talked about, I think, either in October or January where we're sort of finishing kind of an older, I'd say multiyear contract. It's more than a multiyear contract, but a -- an older contract of C-130s that we performed well on, and it's at the tail end of that contract. And we're starting off with sort of the new deliveries and new performance on the new multiyear contract that was just negotiated. So some of that is sort of the resetting, in my words, of the profits, initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As I've said, all along, I still think the economics between the 2 contracts are very similar. But as is our sort of historical practice, we're starting that program a little lower than we ended the last program for C-130s, if that makes sense. On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you're right. We did not increase for the year. We're watching that closely. I'll just leave it that. As we sit here in the first quarter, didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is some upside opportunity. We've seen some good signs, particularly, as you said, Carter, in some of the consumables, particularly in -- with some of our Middle East customers. But I'm watching this to see if it's perhaps somewhat something later on in the year, but not at this time."

So they'll perform essentially at parity with U.S. orders over that period of time. There's not, per se, any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the U.S. military portion of the order, if you will. And this again, is somewhat a kind of what I talked about just now in the C-130 where we have sort of a shifting from an older contract, where we closed out a good performing contract and a newly negotiated contract, where we're starting off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make. And that's exactly what's going on in both the PAC-3 and THAAD programs as we've negotiated some new contracts, and they're starting off slightly lower margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up. Again economically, I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference between the contracts but sort of from a booking perspective, that's the way that's pulling out, but I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk that we have associated with those deliveries."

I think from a big picture perspective, we do expect them to increase sequentially year-over-year. We talked about last year being an expectation of 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program. We achieved that. I think I talked about, again either October or January, the fact that we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016 than 2015. We still expect that, although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015. And we would expect that trend to continue in '17 and '18, as we start to sort of progress to what you're describing, Rich, which is our ultimate expectation, which is by the time we get to full rate production, the margins on the F-35 probably look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its life cycle as F-16 margins, F-22 margins, C-130, et cetera. So I don't think that we're deviating from that expectation. Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we had probably slightly higher pickups on the production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step-ups on production contracts this quarter as well. If I look at last year's first quarter results, I know I didn't talk about this last year. We were actually close to 10% on the production program. So it will sort of peak and valley depending on the step-ups and when they occur and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter. But our expectation, again, is we'll get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production. Your second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated at pretty comparable margin levels as the production programs. So it's not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is growing fairly rapidly. And we're going to start seeing some of the sustainment contracts, sort of split out of the production contracts as this volume gets bigger. So we may in the future end up talk about sustainment separately from production, but you shouldn't think of that as being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point."

So I would say Sikorsky -- and look, we're still early into the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results. So I'm still getting my head around describing Sikorsky and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That's both from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective or an EBIT perspective. We're sort of front-end-loaded during the year with these things I talked about in last quarter's call, these customer lien rights that sort of depressed the sales because of sales or products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That plays out sort of to -- for the most part in the first half of this year. So we would expect to see sort of sequential growth in sales at Sikorsky quarter-over-quarter with the fourth quarter, obviously, being the highest quarter of the year. Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increase quarter-over-quarter. Again, obviously, having the fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well, and this is again some of the timing of the customer lien rights in the first half of the year as well. So I'd say just big picture, that's pretty much in line with what we expected to happen in the first quarter. And we're going to watch it throughout the year, and we'll give you updates as we go and progress through the rest of the year. Secondly, Joe, you asked the question about 2018 pension funding, so we have described several years ago our expectation that we were going to have a 3-year pension holiday, cash funding holiday, as I called it, I think. And that was 2015, '16, and '17. And unfortunately, that holiday does stop at the end of 2017. And in 2018, we would expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think, as we sit here today, Joe, that's probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so. But importantly, I think you shouldn't think of that as necessarily being sort of taking the current run rate of cash and subtracting, so say $5 billion and subtracting $1.5 billion and we're down to $3.5 billion. We expect by 2018 to have a much greater cash from the Sikorsky acquisition as well as cash from the other business areas that's going to offset most, but not all, of that pension contribution. And we also get a tax benefit of that as well. So we get a cash tax benefit associated with that. So it's somewhat mitigated in 2018, so you shouldn't think sort of as falling off the cliff from 2017."

And I'll say, I mean, obviously, we increased the outlook for both sales and profit, so it's exceeded our expectations. I think there's a couple of things going on, and some of them are a little subtle. So sales is just -- this is a tough business to sort of predict, what's -- which competitions are you going to win, which ones are you going to not win. And you get scenarios where things get protested even if you lose and therefore you can actually get the sales stretch out of those. We're sort of seeing all those happen at the same time. So one thing I'm really pleased with, probably more than anything even higher than sort of the sales volume because, again, it gets a little bit hard to call is the better-than-expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write-off on an international contract. And even with that write-off, we still exceeded our expectations, and we still, as obviously, we said earlier increased our guidance for the year. I think that's sort of due to 3 reasons that at least as I look at sort of big picture-wise. One, we had expected a number of recompete activities to occur on some of our larger contracts in the year. And these -- we bid those probably more aggressive than the previous contract where we were the incumbent. And because these contracts are actually being protested, we are continuing the performance on the older contracts, which are at the, if you will, the higher margin on the incumbent contracts. So it's good for us from both the sales perspective, and more importantly, on the margin side because of that. I think we also had better performance on sort of the closeout or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time, and we're actually performing very, very well on those transition periods. And then taking some cost out as we end the program higher than our expectations, which are resulting in higher margins. And then the third thing, I would just say, is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team and, I think, credit goes to that team. I think it's indicative of the fact that they haven't taken their eyes off the ball. It's a well-run organization, and the entire team understands that the mission that they performed for their customers is important, no matter who they work for. And I think we're seeing that play out live in person in front of us here. I'll ask Marillyn to answer the other question you asked, Rob."

First one, just want to build on what Bruce said. I mean, this is a management team that's running a business. They've outlined some commitments for the year, and they're performing the commitments and the whole entire team in IS&GS is making sure that their cost structure is in line with the business base that they have. So as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in, it's ultracompetitive. And it's an area that you've got to constantly be watching your cost, and you have to manage to that. There's close coordination with Leidos as they make headcount reductions. Certainly, we have an agreement as we were going through this process to closing the transaction. So actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side, they are aware that we're going to take those kinds of actions. But it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on the business. It's in all of our best interest, and we will continue to do that with an excellent team that's working that every day."

And we're very much on track to have the 53 aircraft that we talked about in the first quarter -- or the last call in January, excuse me, delivered for the year. So no issue there. So it was just sort of the transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side, there is no issue. There is more of a, I'll say, not quite administrative but not a production issue there. You talked about Sikorsky within MST, and guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That's what we're showing, David, in the outlook there. And even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings perspective with MST, that's one that we're watching closely. It's a little early in the year to go more than that, but I think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we've got on the table right now. If you just do the math the way you did it, David, with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the 3 quarters of the year, you would kind of come to that conclusion, I think, as well. And then lastly, the -- I think the Sikorsky, you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS. So all this has to do with the share reduction from the Reverse Morris Trust transaction and expectation of some of the bleed-off of the transition costs or transaction costs including the integration. That's still our expectation, David, is that'll be neutral going into 2017 with all the pluses and minuses going into that."

Actually, we were ahead of plan in the first quarter, I think a couple of billion dollars' worth or so. So that was -- that may not be apparent, even though it was down, that was not down as much as what our plan had suggested it might be. An interesting thing we're going to have, probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year or at least as we see it or the orders that this year were probably not going to have as large a fourth quarter from an orders perspective as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year, and that's sort of the planning and the biggest single ticket item there is the definitization or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35, and that's worth a significant amount of money. Depending on when that happens and when IS&GS is dispositioned, we can actually see potentially $100 billion worth of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS' disposition. And if I was to pick a number, it's probably going to be somewhere between 90 and -- low 90s to $95 billion, excuse me, by year-end as the expectation. We were sort of expecting at about a -- almost $4.5 million or so, $5 billion drop steady run rate with IS&GS in the mix and when you take out IS&GS it gets down to that $90-ish billion level."

It could potentially delay. I think it's not an indication they're not going to buy it. To me, it's just a matter of them balancing their -- with pressure on their budgets with oil prices balancing what they can buy. And I think that we'll see probably some of that, maybe it'll impact some volumes or delays in some orders. But the bottom line is, you know the conflict in that region, you know the challenges they have from a global security standpoint. And because they have increased security responsibility since the U.S. is not so prevalent there, they're having to step up and buy the things that we need -- that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued demand. It's just a matter of maybe some things will slip. That's not unusual in the international marketplace even on a good day. I mean we don't always see things come right online with what we anticipate anyway because as they're dealing with multiple procurements, they may have to do it more serially sometimes and get one out of the way before they move onto the next.

Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that, Sam, and we actually had -- and Marillyn can comment on this as well, obviously, but we actually had a lot of discussions with the board and our compensation committee. And the concern was that because orders are so variable, I mean a perfect example perhaps is you can imagine a scenario where we had won the bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you give actually someone credit for having won it or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home? I mean these are some of the real live conversations that we had, and we ultimately decided that the sales, earnings and cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of awards. I'll remind you also that we do have an incentive compensation metric associated with focus programs. And the thought was, as long as we win the right programs, I mean, whether or not -- I'll make this up, whether or not the fiscal year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January, it's probably not as important as winning some of our critical competitions. And so we decided to sort of focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they happen again end of this year or beginning of next year."

We still have good performance, and you should think of that as even though the step-ups were lower, the -- sort of the run rate of the programs is higher. And therefore, it's almost comparable but not quite to what we performed in 2016 -- or excuse me, in 2015 in the first quarter compared to 2016. Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I've lost track now who asked it, but the -- our expectation is we still do expect to have margin improvement on the entire program, including the development contract. But the total F-35 program this year, in total, is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015.

And let me just give you, hopefully, a thoughtful answer to your question there. So the challenges that we have on the development program are surely winding down as we're progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the -- I'll say the impacts that might result -- your question sort of tallied what's going on with the concurrency changes if in fact the development program stretched out. Most of the structural types of testing that could result in, I'll say, large concurrency changes, we should have a really, really good idea of where those are, probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year as we complete sort of the fatigue testing and the multiple useful life testing of all 3 variants. We're -- I've lost track off the top of my head where we are in progressing on that, but all 3 variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability. And we're in 150% of useful life and beyond, I believe, for where we are in the testing of that. So most of the structural items, I would say I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some  relative to some software changes that come out of it, relative to some testing and particularly some of the armament testing later in the developmental program that might result in some software changes. I don't typically view those as sort of concurrency issues. We're still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year. We're making really good progress on the software to accomplish that. The ALIS program is probably the other thing that we all have our eyes on in terms of this is the sustainment vehicle that, sort of, is your one-stop shop for sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we're doing there is high on our list of things to be mindful of, but I think that's still going to support the IOC and whenever that's scheduled, the fourth quarter or so of this year. I'll remind you the development contract is still cost reimbursable, and I know your question is more on the concurrency, but we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably once we get past these testings the latter part of this year and to early 2017."

But -- so I think I've said publicly, once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort of  re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think, organically going forward, you should expect us to have about 3% to 5% growth heavily driven, obviously, by the F-35 program and Aeronautics, in general. Also contributing to that is across all the business areas it may not be self-evident because we've actually got some DoD contractions in some of the business areas there, but our international growth is probably going to grow from 21% or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not-too-distant future. So that's helping fuel that growth as well. As far as the reductions, I would say that's not because of pressure that's being put on us from a DoD perspective. There is -- if you just think of the life cycle and it goes back a little bit to Seth's question there, the development program is winding down, the production program is going leaps and bounds year-over-year. And so the workforce is sort of transitioning more from sort of an engineering-dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing-based workforce. And we're starting to see that transition occur. And that's what some of these reductions are for, is simply the lower level of or sort of the development program going down and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the manufacturing growth as what we saw on the development programs, if that makes sense."

Yes, we talked about that India is looking at their taxable fighter competition, and we are in there with an offer to move our production line to India. In terms of the mark, the most recent mark that came out of the HASC for the defense bill, they have -- as you have seen have added 11 aircraft for the F-35. We -- and so we saw an increase last year in FY '16 on the buzz and so it seem that coming forward as important. There are, also, a lot of our programs are well supported, just in the budget itself. And then with potential adds as they look at additional opportunities. On the F-22, I know there's been some discussion about a restart on the F-22, and we just stand ready to support with whatever information we're asked to provide. You're probably aware that the 2 guys still exist. And so there will be -- as most programs you start one from a cold start I'm sure that they really want to understand the cost associated with a cold start, but at the same time you wouldn't want to build the same aircraft, so you'll do some upgrades to that aircraft, modernize it, and some of the design -- incorporate some of the things that we've learned through F-35 and other programs that you could incorporate into that. So we'll stand ready to support that. But bottom line is, I think, our programs are well supported in the present budget submission. And then I think the markets going through would potentially add some additional ones for us. And we know there's a long way to go on the budget process, it's early days in getting through that. So we remain hopeful that with our programs, they're really line up with the department strategic priorities that they will continue to be well supported."

The integration cost, still think that the bulk of that will be completed in 2017. And still, some of that might carry over into 2018 -- excuse me, 2017, as we look forward there. I still think, as we sit here today, that we're tracking towards what we talked about when we did the acquisition, which was about $150 million or so per year of steady state savings beginning in 2018.

So I think the way you should think about the severance charge, Cai, is somewhere in the range of roughly 3/4 is Aero, somewhere in the $70-ish million and the difference -- $70 million, $75 million maybe, and the difference is in IS&GS. I don't have the numbers exactly to memory, Cai. But somewhere in that range 3/4, 1/4 or so. As I said earlier and I think I was talking to Myles on the question on the headcount reduction in Aeronautics most of these are salaried folks. As Marillyn said, some of the indirect support required to -- that's no longer going to be required to support sort of the production ramp rate that was required to support some of the developmental work that we were doing. Importantly, I think, a big piece of the Aeronautics reduction was actually a voluntary reduction. And I think we actually got about what we were expecting as a result of that voluntary reduction, so we were pleased with that, that people -- that it came with very few, I'll say, involuntary reductions. So I think that's a good thing as well. And then as far as the recovery of this year or not, that's still playing out, Cai. We're trying -- I mean, I think in big picture terms that you should expect to see a somewhat neutral reaction in 2016. And there may be some benefit as depending on what the timing is of the reductions or the severance charges as they play out that may carry on in 2017. We'll watch that closely and monitor that as we go through the next 3 quarters to see if there is an impact in 2016. But if -- and there is, we'll surely tell you about it. And if it happens in 2017, we'll try to give you insight to that quickly as well."

We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, operationally and financially. The corporation continues to track towards another year of strong financial results while returning value to stockholders and delivering critical solutions to customers. 
I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including the status of the strategic transactions in which our Information Systems & Global Solutions business will be separated from Lockheed Martin and combined with Leidos, and I'll share some noteworthy operational achievements in our business areas.
Turning to the summary financials. Our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, with second quarter numbers exceeding all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enables us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. If the divestiture of IS&GS is completed in the third quarter, as currently anticipated, we will revise our 2016 financial outlook during our call with you in October.
Switching to IS&GS and the status of its combination with Leidos, significant progress towards transaction closure continues to be achieved. We commenced our exchange offer on Monday of last week. Also last week, the competition in markets authority in the United Kingdom concluded its review, satisfying another close condition to closing. As we outlined in our press release last week, announcing the start of the exchange period, the offer provides Lockheed Martin stockholders the opportunity to exchange their shares of Lockheed Martin for shares of stock in the Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which then become shares of Leidos common stock upon completion of the transaction. As you are aware, the combination of IS&GS with Leidos is structured as a tax efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We will then return the shares of Lockheed Martin stock exchange, achieving a significant reduction in our outstanding share count. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, and closing is currently scheduled for August 16.
Switching to operational highlights. I'll start with some key accomplishments and events on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall, the program continued to achieve good progress across a multiple fronts of winding down development activities, ramping up production rates and sustainment activity and securing customer support and demand. On the development program, key events in this quarter included surpassing 60,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations and maturity of the aircraft. We are also achieving increased stability on the software in the aircraft and on the ground support equipment. We continue to make strides on software development on the aircraft and on the automatic logistics information system known as ALIS that is used to maintain the F-35 claims. Evidence of this progress was demonstrated last month in Mountain Home airbase in Idaho where F-35 fighters were deployed to remote sites to test aircraft performance and mission availability using the latest version of the maturing software. During this deployment, the aircraft successfully cleared 88 of 88 sorties while also achieving 100% on-time performance of the sorties. Additionally, the aircraft achieved 0 avionic shutdowns on the ground or in flight due to any software stability issues.
Deployment met all of the customer's tactical objectives and proved that the aircraft can successfully operate at remote locations away from base. These successful series of tests are key milestones in preparation of the F-35 C-12 fleet to achieve initial operational capability for the U.S. Air Force later this year. During the deployment test of the Mountain Home base, the F-35 had the opportunity to engage with frontline legacy aircraft and performed exceptionally well in mock combat engagements. The tremendous technological leap and capabilities that the F-35 provides are being demonstrated on a daily basis to a growing number of domestic and international customers as the aircraft is fielded at additional sites.
With the future price of an F-35 estimated to approach the price of a legacy fighter, the unmatched capability of fifth-generation stealth provided by the Joint Strike Fighter becomes even more compelling to customers as they capitalize -- recapitalize their fighter fleets.
Looking at the production activities in the program, progress continues to be made in ramping up the rate of production and reducing the cost of the aircraft. On production, we are on track to increase our deliveries to 53 aircraft this year and have delivered approximately 180 aircraft since program inception. In the area of cost reductions, we continue to make significant progress on our previously announced blueprint shared commitment between the government and industry. To build upon that success, we announced 2 additional cost reduction initiative last week at Farnborough. The first action is a 2-year extension of our cost savings investment that is designed to achieve life cycle savings of more than $4 billion over the remaining production rent of aircraft. Additionally, we also announced an initiative over the next couple of years to reduce sustainment cost by 10%. This action is expected to achieve $1 billion in savings for the 5-year period and includes projects such as spare parts block buys and establishing ALIS regional sustainment centers.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35, key milestones this past quarter on the domestic side include revalidation to Congress by the Department of Defense of the critical and unchanged procurement requirement to replace legacy aircraft with 2443 JSF fighters for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Internationally, support remains strong and growing with key events that included selection of the F-35 by the Danish Parliament as their next-generation fighter with procurement of 27 aircraft, rollout of the first F-35A for Israel at our Fort Worth facility and the arrival of the first 2 F-35A fighters into the Netherlands. I was able to see firsthand the growing international interest and support of the F-35 earlier this month when I had the opportunity to attend both the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough air shows in the United Kingdom. Customers and attendees were able to see up close the revolutionary capabilities of both CTOL and [indiscernible] 35 aircraft at the air show as they performed their aerial maneuvers. This marked the debut of the F-35 at major international air shows, demonstrating the increasing maturity and progress on the programs. We're honored to partner with international F-35 partners to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively filled this next-generation fighter for decades to come.
Turning to other areas in the corporation, a noteworthy accomplishment was achieved on our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The test helicopters on the development program continue to progress through a series of increasing payload lift weights to validate capabilities. Recently, the aircraft successfully lifted a 27,000-pound external load, satisfying the contractual requirement for maximum lift weight. With more than tripled the payload of the predecessor CH-53E, the new helicopter can accommodate a range of missions. The CH-53K can execute heavy lift missions more effectively and safely in day and night in all weather conditions using its modern glass cockpit. To date, we have delivered 3 CH-53K helicopters on the development program that are enabling testing to move ahead and support the services goal to achieve initial operational capability planned in 2019. Providing this enhancement capability is essential to our war fighters, and the Department of Defense program of record continues to project procurement of 200 CH-53K aircraft to replace aging legacy helicopters. The CH-53K is also generating growing interest from multiple countries in addition to that in the United States and offers opportunities to expand production levels beyond the quantities required on the Marine Corps program.
I will conclude my remarks by offering my congratulations to our Space Systems team for their flawless support of NASA's interplanetary mission to insert the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft was designed and constructed by our space personnel in Colorado and has been operated as a joint team with NASA. After launch in August 2011, the spacecraft traveled 1.8 billion miles to Jupiter at speeds of up to 165,000 miles per hour for almost 5 years before successfully settling into orbit on July 4. Juno will spend nearly 2 years orbiting the planet while setting the structure, origin, atmosphere and magnetic sphere of Jupiter for NASA. The successful orbit insertion mission exemplifies the unmatched capability of our corporation and making the impossible possible for our customers. There were no second chances for this orbital insertion, and our spacecraft and teammates performed flawlessly in achieving mission success
Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to offer my appreciation and thanks to our IS&GS team. Their dedication and continued focus on mission execution and our customers during this extended transitional phase has been superb. For the upcoming closure of the transaction with Leidos, I am certain that IS&GS efforts have made the business even stronger and helped position the new enterprise to generate value for shareholders and opportunities for employees as they move forward.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,369116880,1007893,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlighted key financial compliments, please follow along on the web charts included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.Sales for the qu",1352,"Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlighted key financial compliments, please follow along on the web charts included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.
Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, well ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.32 in the quarter, and we'll discuss each of these metrics in the coming charts. 
We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter. And as with last quarter, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All in all, we and a strong quarter and are well-positioned to the first half of the year to achieve our outlook.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.3 billion or 11% this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky in the results of MST for about $1.2 billion and nearly $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by $400 million higher F-35 volume, which more than offset 2 fewer C-5 deliveries in the quarter compared to last year. Segment operating profit was $24 million higher than last year with the growth coming from the volume in Aeronautics and significantly higher profit in IS&GS and Space Systems. These increases more than offset the effects of purchase accounting adjustments and transaction cost associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky as well as the expected reduction of margin at Missiles and Fire Control.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.32, which represents about a 13% increase over the EPS in the second quarter of last year. This year benefited from strong operational performance, higher FAS/CAS adjustment and a $0.04 benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in our earnings release.
If you turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash of operations in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was almost $1.5 billion, $200 million more than in the second quarter of last year. This is particularly noteworthy, given that we expected to recover a significant amount of cash associated with the completion of negotiations on F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 by now. Strong cash generation at each of the other 4 business areas beyond Aeronautics, including a large international receipt by Sikorsky, helped to offset the F-35 shortfall. And while we expect to recover that shortfall soon, if additional funding is not received, the investment level will grow dramatically during the coming months.
Turning to Chart 7, you can see the significant amount of cash returned to our stockholders in the quarter. With just over $1 billion returned to stockholders, evenly split between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over 80% of free cash flow in the quarter. 
Chart 8 provides an update to our current outlook for the year. As a result of the strong performance in the quarter and prospects for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook by $400 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million. We'll provide additional insights into these improvements the next 2 charts. We also increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.65, and we'll provide more detail into that increase in a few charts. And we are increasing our cash from operations outlook by $100 million. This obviously assumes that we received additional F-35 funding as we've already discussed.
And as a reminder, our guidance continues to assume the inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. Chart 9 provides the updated sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook by $400 million, $350 million in Aeronautics, due primarily to higher-than-planned F-35 volume and $50 million in Space Systems, reflecting the stronger start to the year than we anticipated. 
On Chart 10, we showed the changes to our segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our profit outlook by $125 million, with $60 million of that increase coming from IS&GS as a result of its strong first half performance. Aeronautics increased by $40 million, driven by the higher sales volume, and Space Systems increased by $25 million, reflecting a better-than-planned performance today. 
Moving to Chart 11, we have a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook compared with the first quarter. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit increases our outlook by $0.25. The newly adopted accounting standard for the treatment of equity-based compensation that we described in our earnings release increased 2016 EPS by $0.45. This change in accounting is reflected as if it had been in place from the beginning of the year. As a result, our year-to-date EPS includes the benefit of $0.37, $0.33 from the first quarter when the majority of our equity-based compensation vested. The remaining 2 quarters of the year are anticipated to receive similar benefits of $0.04 per quarter totaling to the $0.45 increase for the year. A number of minor other changes in the quarter amounted to $0.05 reduction to EPS. And combined, these changes increased our EPS outlook by $0.65 for the year. 
On Chart 12, we have a reminder of several key financial impacts that we expect when the IS&GS Reverse Morris Trust transaction closes. We'll receive a special cash payment of $1.8 billion. At current trading prices, we would expect to reduce our common shares outstanding by about 10 million shares though this is obviously subject to change as both Lockheed Martin and Leidos stock prices fluctuate during the exchange period. And we would expect a significant book gain when the deal closes. In addition to the deal closure in the third quarter, we expect to have a number of other significant events occur in the quarter as well.
Chart 13 highlights these upcoming financial events. Obviously, the first significant event we are expecting is the IS&GS transaction closure. The year-to-date results if IS&GS true closure will be moved to discontinued operations as well as the book gain that we discussed on the prior chart. We also expect to have a net pension gain upon closure associated with the departure of IS&GS employees. This pension gain will be reported in discontinued operations as well. Corporate cost allocated to IS&GS up to the date of closure will be moved from IS&GS' results and reflected as other unallocated cost and continuing operations. Importantly, there is no economic impact as a result of this cost reclassification, and we will be filing pro forma financials. Next, we expect to close on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts and recover the significant operating cash tied to those negotiations. We also expect to increase our ownership and obtain control of a joint venture within Space Systems to manage the atomic weapons establishment in the U.K. A book gain will be recognized in our operating results upon closure of the transaction. Going forward, we will fully consolidate financials and continue to report its operating results in our Space Systems segment. Then, we expect to finalize our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments next quarter. And lastly, we'll provide our trend information for 2017, including an updated discount rate projection and its impact on our expected FAS/CAS adjustment. So you can see that we anticipate a number of moving pieces in the quarter, some of which are individually significant but collectively, will be quite significant. We'll provide updated guidance for all these events during our next earnings call in October. 
Finally, on Chart 14, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter that led to increases in our outlook. The IS&GS exchange offer has begun which places us on the path to close a transaction in the middle of August, and we remain focused on providing outstanding products and services to our customers and strong returns to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Cat?"

So w5 been funding that for a while. We continue to ask for funding recovery from the U.S. government. To this point, they've not funded us. At some point in the future because of the growth that we see over the next few months, and you should think of this literally growing, Pete, in the $400 million to $500 million per month sorts of levels.

So we're probably a little early to be talking about it. Feels a little early if you're talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment recently, particularly after the Brexit situation, I think, what the 10-year treasury is going for at 1.4% or thereabout. So dramatic reduction from the start of the year to now. I think we ended the year at a discount rate of about 4 3/8 or 4.375%. If we were to strike a line in the sand right now, it's probably 100 basis points lower than that. You tell me whether you think it's going to increase between now and the end of the year or not. But if it did not, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate from where we ended last year is worth about $125 million delta to FAS expense. So that's a pretty significant reduction to FAS next year. The asset returns, you didn't ask about those, but that's the other component in the mix the asset returns are actually tracking pretty nicely towards an 8% return. We got a nice lift in the equity markets, particularly domestically here recently that helped with that situation. So if I were to predict, again, kind of striking the line in the sand, our current FAS/CAS in 2016 is roughly, what, $975 million or so of income. Looking forward and just carrying those impacts into 2017 that I just described, '17 would probably be $350 million, maybe $400 million lower than 2016, still income from FAS/CAS, if you will, but not as much income as what we've been expecting and talking about previously. As to your cash funding question, there is no impact next year at all associated with the discount rate change. I mean there is a risk which requires the funding levels for our pension justice sensitive to asset returns than the discount rate changes. FAS is sort of an instantaneous discount rate impact than a risk spread over time, so we wouldn't expect any change whatsoever in the funding requirements in 2017, still 0."

So we have said, 2017 we talked about being the last of the 3-year what we call pension funding holiday that we announced, I guess, at the beginning of 2015. As Rich asked in his question about cash funding, we don't see that changing in 2017. In previous quarters, I did talk about 2018 having a acquired pension contribution, and obviously, that's still the case. However, what I was trying to convey and the number you threw out, about $1.5 billion is flowing around there, maybe a little bit higher now. So what I was trying to convey in previous calls and I'll try to convey in this call is you should think of the current level of operating cash dropping by the full amount of pension funding in 2018, and that's really for a couple of reasons. One is we expect to get much stronger cash flows from Sikorsky in 2018 versus what we're seeing today. We expect to have higher cash flow from F-35 than we're seeing today. And then lastly, as you described in your question, we also will get a tax benefit associated with the pension cash contribution in 2018, so think about it as sort of 65% simplistically of the cash contribution is what will be a hit to operating cash in that year, if you will."

We still feel strongly about the dividend capital allocation to be provided to shareholders. We have  if you just look at the composition of our shareholder base, it's probably -- I don't remember, 30%, 35%. I'm looking at Jerry as I say this. 30%, 35% of our investor base is income base, so that's a pretty significant element of our ownership that is driven, in fact, by the dividend yield so that's an important aspect of capital allocation going forward. I always say that I think the best indication of what we'll do there is the track record we have in the last few years or even a decade or more relative to dividend contributions. We still have some options that have yet to be exercised. The option exercise has actually slowed down quite a bit. You might remember, Sam, you've been following us long enough years ago. We had a lot of dilution as a result of options being exercised. That level has come down quite a bit, but there's still a backlog of options out there that as those do get exercise, we will clearly do share repurchases to offset that dilution. We will do share repurchases to offset dilution from the equity compensation as well. And then from that point, Sam, as usual, this may not be the most satisfying answer you'll get, a seasonal it depends what's available at that time including other opportunities to invest in programs, acquisitions, that sort of thing, the one thing that probably don't make a whole lot of sense at least at this point is to let us just say it idly on the balance sheet making little interest as in fact it does.

We don't currently have plans for F-35 production step-ups for the rest or for the second half of the year, so that's one of the things that we'll cause the second half of the year to look a little lighter probably than the first time of the year.

In our case, there is some discussion around whether or not the Air Force wants to pursue a clean sheet design or an existing design, we believe that with tremendous gap on the training capabilities of the T38 is, I don't think it's [indiscernible] 15 years old or something like that, they need to replace that aircraft and the fact that we have a low-risk aircraft that's already flying that can meet today's requirements we think we're offering something that would allow the U.S. Air Force to move forward on the program and meet that capability. There are other offerings out there as well that are not clean sheet, and so we'd like to compete, and we think we have a tremendous offering."

When we announced the deal back in January, we said that the share buyback was essentially going to be enough to make the sort of neutral between the 2 years. Since that time, our stock has increased. If I look at today, it's up almost 25% over what the number was in January. I think we were trading at around $210 a share the day we announced the deal. So pretty significant increase on our side, which makes it obviously more expensive to buy back the same number of shares we had expected in the January call. On the other hand, the Leidos stock price has dropped a little bit since that time, so both of those are sort of working against us from shares perspective that will be taken out as a result of the RMP transaction. So as we sit today, George, even with 1.8, it's probably difficult to get exactly to neutral, but it gets a lot closer there. We still think the economics of this deal relative to all options that we looked at on outright sale appears spin, this is still the best situation for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders, and we don't have regret on that, notwithstanding the fact that to your point we actually are seeing a little bit of EPS dilution as a result of the stock price movement. I think that's a little bit of a high-class problem that we're experiencing right now but nonetheless, that is where we are. As to the charge we took, we did take an additional charge, $30 million, you're right. This is sort of the command-and-control business that we're looking. So think of this as sort of a system that controls all sorts of air missile defense capabilities around an entire country, including identifying friends or foes so that you don't have the wrong issues with that air missile defense capability. So linking into a lot of different systems we think we have prospects once this system is developed in other places internationally, but we've had some growing pains, obviously with this, and I think as we've gone through the development and early stages of this program, the customer has kind of changed some of what their expectations are, so we are in discussions with the customer right now about sort of closure of this contract. We think where it sits right now, it's pretty well positioned in terms of the charges we've taken. There's some upside potential to that depending on where the customer wants to have. There could be some downside so we're kind of in the middle of that right now, George, and obviously, will keep you apprized as we go through future quarters and let you know how we're performing on a that contract."

I've always said it's similar points in time with the program's life cycle it all to look like an F-16 program or an F-22 or C-130, there's sort of nothing structural that would prevent us from getting to those levels.

I think I heard feedback as we went around and invest in conference and so forth I think I stumbled with they're quite honestly so I tried to be clear this time obviously I'm still not being clear, but let me try to be as crystal clear as I can this thing. So FAS/CAS in 2016, the benefit is about $975 million or so. What I said is I would expect to be between -- if we struck the line of the sand right now, probably $350 million to $400 million lower than the 2016 FAS/CAS benefit in 2017. I mean, to do the math, that kind of translates into $625 million, $600-ish million income number, down considerably from what we were talking about in the first quarter of last year, almost all of that because of the discount rate change in the 1,000 -- or not 100 basis points as I talked about. back to Rich's question, it's a noncash item, will not affect our 2017 contributions at all, and that relates to your question relative to the $1.8 billion and would we use that to fund and prefer the pension plan. The answer is we don't have expectation sitting here today, and I don't think that's what we will do with the money. As I said earlier to another question I think the more likely outcome is probably share repurchases at this point in time, and we'll fund the 2018 requirement in 2018. We've already got, quite honestly, fairly sizable prepayment credit balance in terms of how much we contributed to our reserve versus what we've collected from government contracts, and we don't see the point at this time to sort of increasing that level."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, operationally and financially. The corporation continues to track towards another year of strong financial results while returning value to stockholders and delivering critical solutions to customers.
I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including the status of the strategic transactions in which our Information Systems & Global Solutions business will be separated from Lockheed Martin and combined with Leidos, and I'll share some noteworthy operational achievements in our business areas.
Turning to the summary financials. Our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, with second quarter numbers exceeding all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. If the divestiture of IS&GS is completed in the third quarter as currently anticipated, we will revise our 2016 financial outlook during our call with you in October.
Switching to IS&GS and the status of its combination with Leidos. Significant progress towards transaction closure continues to be achieved. We commenced our exchange offer on Monday of last week. Also last week, the competition in markets authority in the United Kingdom concluded its review, satisfying another closed -- condition to closing. As we outlined in our press release last week announcing the start of the exchange period, the offer provides Lockheed Martin stockholders the opportunity to exchange their shares of Lockheed Martin for shares of stock in the Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which then become shares of Leidos common stock upon completion of the transaction. As you are aware, the combination of IS&GS with Leidos is structured as a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We will then retire the shares of Lockheed Martin stock exchange, achieving a significant reduction in our outstanding share count. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, and closing is currently scheduled for August 16.
Switching to operational highlights. I'll start with some key accomplishments and events on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall, the program continued to achieve good progress across the multiple fronts of winding down development activities, ramping up production rate and sustainment activities and securing customer support and demand. On the development program, key events this quarter included surpassing 60,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations and maturity of the aircraft. We are also achieving increased stability in the software on the aircraft and in the ground support equipment. We continue to make strides in software development on the aircraft and in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, known as ALIS, that is used to maintain the F-35 planes. Evidence of this progress was demonstrated last month in Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho where F-35 fighters were deployed to a remote site to test aircraft performance and mission availability using the latest version of the maturing software. During this deployment, the aircraft successfully cleared 88 of 88 sorties while also achieving 100% on-time performance of the sorties. Additionally, the aircraft achieved 0 avionic shutdowns on the ground or in flight due to any software stability issues.
The deployment met all of the customer's tactical objectives and proved that the aircraft can successfully operate at remote locations away from its home base. These successful series of tests are key milestones in preparation of the F-35 CTOL fleet to achieve initial operational capability for the U.S. Air Force later this year. During the deployment test at the Mountain Home Base, the F-35 had the opportunity to engage with frontline legacy aircraft and performed exceptionally well in mock combat engagements. The tremendous technological leap and capabilities that the F-35 provides are being demonstrated on a daily basis to a growing number of domestic and international customers as the aircraft is fielded at additional sites.
With the future price of an F-35 estimated to approach the price of a legacy fighter, the unmatched capability of fifth-generation stealth provided by the Joint Strike Fighter becomes even more compelling to customers as they capitalize -- recapitalize their fighter fleets.
Looking at the production activities in the program, progress continues to be made in ramping up the rate of production and reducing the cost of the aircraft. On production, we are on track to increase our deliveries to 53 aircraft this year and have delivered approximately 180 aircraft since program inception. In the area of cost reductions, we continue to make significant progress on our previously announced Blueprint for Affordability shared commitment between the government and industry. To build upon that success, we announced 2 additional cost reduction initiatives last week at Farnborough. The first action is a 2-year extension of our cost savings investment that is designed to achieve life cycle savings of more than $4 billion over the remaining production run of aircraft. Additionally, we also announced an initiative over the next couple of years to reduce sustainment cost by 10%. This action is expected to achieve $1 billion in savings for the 5-year period and includes projects such as spare parts block buys and establishing ALIS regional sustainment centers.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35. Key milestones this past quarter on the domestic side include revalidation to Congress by the Department of Defense of the critical and unchanged procurement requirement to replace legacy aircraft with 2,443 JSF fighters for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Internationally, support remains strong and growing, with key events that included: selection of the F-35 by the Danish Parliament as their next-generation fighter with the procurement of 27 aircraft; rollout of the first F-35A for Israel at our Fort Worth facility; and the arrival of the first 2 F-35A fighters into the Netherlands. I was able to see firsthand the growing international interest and support of the F-35 earlier this month when I had the opportunity to attend both the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough air shows in the United Kingdom. Customers and attendees were able to see up close the revolutionary capabilities of both CTOL and STOVL F-35 aircraft at the air shows as they performed their aerial maneuvers. This marked the debut of the F-35 at major international air shows, demonstrating the increasing maturity and progress on the program. We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively field this next-generation fighter for decades to come.
Turning to other areas in the corporation. A noteworthy accomplishment was achieved on our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The test helicopters on the development program continue to progress through a series of increasing payload lift weights to validate capabilities. Recently, the aircraft successfully lifted a 27,000-pound external load, satisfying the contractual requirement for maximum lift weight. With more than triple the payload of the predecessor CH-53E, the new helicopter can accommodate a range of missions. The CH-53K can execute heavy lift missions more effectively and safely in day and night, in all weather conditions using its modern glass cockpit. To date, we have delivered 3 CH-53K helicopters on the development program that are enabling testing to move ahead and support the service's goal to achieve initial operational capability planned in 2019. Providing this enhanced capability is essential to our war fighters, and the Department of Defense program of record continues to project procurement of 200 CH-53K aircraft to replace aging legacy helicopters. The CH-53K is also generating growing interest from multiple countries in addition to that in the United States and offers opportunities to expand production levels beyond the quantities required on the Marine Corps program.
I will conclude my remarks by offering my congratulations to our Space Systems team for their flawless support of NASA's interplanetary mission to insert the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft was designed and constructed by our space personnel in Colorado and has been operated as a joint team with NASA. After launch in August 2011, the spacecraft traveled 1.8 billion miles to Jupiter at speeds of up to 165,000 miles per hour for almost 5 years before successfully settling into orbit on July 4. Juno will spend nearly 2 years orbiting the planet while setting the structure, origin, atmosphere and magnetic sphere of Jupiter for NASA. The successful orbit-insertion mission exemplifies the unmatched capability of our corporation and making the impossible possible for our customers. There were no second chances for this orbital insertion, and our spacecraft and teammates performed flawlessly in achieving mission success.
Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to offer my appreciation and thanks to our IS&GS team. Their dedication and continued focus on mission execution and our customers during this extended transitional phase has been superb. For the upcoming closure of the transaction with Leidos, I am certain that the IS&GS efforts have made the business even stronger and helped position the new enterprise to generate value for shareholders and opportunities for employees as they move forward.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."

Good morning, everyone.As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.",1363,"Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone.
As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.
Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, well ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.32 in the quarter, and we'll discuss each of these metrics in the coming charts.
We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter. And as with last quarter, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All in all, we had a strong quarter and are well-positioned through the first half of the year to achieve our outlook.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.3 billion or 11% this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky in the results of MST for about $1.2 billion and nearly $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by $400 million higher F-35 volume, which more than offset 2 fewer C-5 deliveries in the quarter compared to last year. Segment operating profit was $24 million higher than last year, with the growth coming from the volume at Aeronautics and significantly higher profit in IS&GS and Space Systems. These increases more than offset the effects of purchase accounting adjustments and transaction cost associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky as well as the expected reduction of margin at Missiles and Fire Control.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.32, which represents about a 13% increase over the EPS in the second quarter of last year. This year benefited from strong operational performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment and a $0.04 benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in our earnings release.
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash from operations in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was almost $1.5 billion, $200 million more than in the second quarter of last year. This is particularly noteworthy, given that we expected to recover a significant amount of cash associated with the completion of negotiations on F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 by now. Strong cash generation in each of the other 4 business areas beyond Aeronautics, including a large international receipt by Sikorsky, helped to offset the F-35 shortfall. And while we expect to recover that shortfall soon, if additional funding is not received, the investment level will grow dramatically during the coming months.
Turning to Chart 7, you can see the significant amount of cash returned to our stockholders in the quarter. With just over $1 billion returned to stockholders, evenly split between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over 80% of free cash flow in the quarter.
Chart 8 provides an update to our current outlook for the year. As a result of the strong performance in the quarter and prospects for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook by $400 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million. We'll provide additional insight into these improvements in the next 2 charts. We also increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.65, and we'll provide more detail into that increase in a few charts. And we are increasing our cash from operations outlook by $100 million. This obviously assumes that we receive additional F-35 funding as we've already discussed. And as a reminder, our guidance continues to assume the inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business.
Chart 9 provides the updated sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook by $400 million, $350 million in Aeronautics, due primarily to higher-than-planned F-35 volume and $50 million in Space Systems, reflecting the stronger start to the year than we anticipated.
On Chart 10, we show the changes to our segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our profit outlook by $125 million, with $60 million of that increase coming from IS&GS as a result of its strong first half performance. Aeronautics increased by $40 million, driven by the higher sales volume, and Space Systems increased by $25 million, reflecting its better-than-planned performance to date.
Moving to Chart 11. We have a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook compared with the first quarter. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit increases our outlook by $0.25. The newly adopted accounting standard for the treatment of equity-based compensation that we described in our earnings release increased 2016 EPS by $0.45. This change in accounting is reflected as if it had been in place from the beginning of the year. As a result, our year-to-date EPS includes the benefit of $0.37, $0.33 from the first quarter when the majority of our equity-based compensation vested. The remaining 2 quarters of the year are anticipated to receive similar benefits of $0.04 per quarter, totaling to the $0.45 increase for the year. A number of minor other changes in the quarter amounted to a $0.05 reduction to EPS. And combined, these changes increased our EPS outlook by $0.65 for the year.
On Chart 12, we have a reminder of several key financial impacts that we expect when the IS&GS Reverse Morris Trust transaction closes. We'll receive a special cash payment of $1.8 billion. At current trading prices, we would expect to reduce our common shares outstanding by about 10 million shares, though this is obviously subject to change as both Lockheed Martin and Leidos stock prices fluctuate during the exchange period. And we would expect to have a significant book gain when the deal closes. In addition to the deal closure in the third quarter, we expect to have a number of other significant events occur in the quarter as well.
Chart 13 highlights these upcoming financial events. Obviously, the first significant event we are expecting is the IS&GS transaction closure. The year-to-date results of IS&GS true closure will be moved to discontinued operations as will the book gain that we discussed on the prior chart. We also expect to have a net pension gain upon closure associated with the departure of IS&GS employees. This pension gain will be recorded in discontinued operations as well. Corporate costs allocated to IS&GS up to the date of closure will be moved from IS&GS's results and reflected as other unallocated costs and continuing operations. Importantly, there is no economic impact as a result of this cost reclassification, and we'll be filing pro forma financials.
Next, we expect to close on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts and recover the significant operating cash tied to those negotiations. We also expect to increase our ownership and obtain control of a joint venture within Space Systems to manage the atomic weapons establishment in the U.K. A book gain will be recognized in our operating results upon closure of the transaction. Going forward, we will fully consolidate [indiscernible] financials and continue to report its operating results in our Space Systems segment. Then, we expect to finalize our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments next quarter. And lastly, we'll provide our trend information for 2017, including an updated discount rate projection and its impact on our expected FAS/CAS adjustment. So you can see that we anticipate a number of moving pieces in the quarter, some of which are individually significant, but collectively, will be quite significant. We'll provide updated guidance for all these events during our next earnings call in October.
Finally on Chart 14, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter and that led to increases in our outlook. The IS&GS exchange offer has begun, which places us on the path to close the transaction in the middle of August, and we remain focused on providing outstanding products and services to our customers and strong returns to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Kat [ph]?"

Had a -- for whatever reason, the U.S. government has not decided to put funds that are authorized and appropriated to fund Lockheed Martin and our subcontractor efforts on the contracts, so we've been -- we made the decision at the time that we were going to not allow a stop on the program and cause the disruption on the program, particularly in our supply base, that's -- since that's where most of the work is being done at these -- at this time on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts. So we've been funding that for a while. We continue to ask for funding recovery from the U.S. government. To this point, they have not funded us. At some point in the future because of the growth that we see over the next few months, and you should think of this literally growing, Pete, in the $400 million to $500 million per month sorts of levels. We will not be able to sustain that. So -- but if we don't either get funding through a funding mechanism such as a UCA funding item or we definitize the contracts, we will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation. We simply don't have that capacity. The Pentagon clearly knows that situation, and I'm optimistic that we're going to get cash soon."

I'll take that one, Rich. So we're probably a little early to be talking about -- it feels a little early if you're talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment here recently, particularly after the Brexit situation. I mean, I think what our 10-year treasury is going for at 1.4% or thereabouts, so dramatic reduction from the start of the year to now. I think we ended the year at a discount rate of about 4 3/8 or 4.375%. If we were to strike a line in the sand right now, it's probably 100 basis points lower than that. You tell me whether you think it's going to increase between now and the end of the year or not. But if it did not, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate from where we ended last year is worth about $125 million delta to FAS expense. So that's a pretty significant reduction to FAS next year. Our asset returns -- you didn't ask about those, but that's the other component in the mix. The asset returns are actually tracking pretty nicely towards an 8% return. We've had a nice lift in the equity markets, particularly domestically here recently that had helped with that situation. So if I were to predict, again, kind of striking the line in the sand, our current FAS/CAS in 2016 is roughly, what, $975 million or so of income. Looking forward and just carrying those impacts into 2017 that I just described, '17 would probably be $350 million, maybe $400 million lower than 2016, still income from FAS/CAS, if you will, but not as much income as what we've been expecting and talking about previously. As to your cash funding question, there is no impact next year at all associated with the discount rate change. I mean, ERISA is far more -- ERISA, which requires the funding levels for our pension trust, is far more sensitive to asset returns than the discount rate changes. FAS is sort of an instantaneous discount rate impact whereas ERISA's spread over time, so we wouldn't expect any change whatsoever in the funding requirements in 2017. Still 0."

So we have said, the -- 2017, we talked about being the last of the 3-year, what we call, pension-funding holiday that we announced, I guess, at the beginning of 2015. As Rich asked in his question about cash funding, we don't see that changing in 2017. In previous quarters, I did talk about 2018 having a required pension contribution, and obviously, that's still the case. However, what I was trying to convey and the number you threw out, about $1.5 billion, it's flowing around there, maybe a little bit higher now. So what I was trying to convey on previous calls and what I'll try to convey on this call is that you shouldn't think of sort of the current level of operating cash dropping by the full amount of pension funding in 2018, and that's really for a couple of reasons. One is we expect to get much stronger cash flows from Sikorsky in 2018 versus what we're seeing today. We expect to have higher cash flow from F-35 than we're seeing today. And then lastly, as you described in your question, we also will get a tax benefit associated with the pension cash contribution in 2018, so think of that as sort of 65% simplistically of the cash contribution is what will be a hit to operating cash in that year, if you will."

We have, if you just look at the composition of our sharehold",389,"Yes, let me take a shot at that, Sam. So it's a great question as far as capital allocation plans. We still feel strongly about the dividend capital allocation that we provided to shareholders. We have, if you just look at the composition of our shareholder base, it's probably -- I don't remember, 30%, 35%. I'm looking at Jerry as I say this. 30%, 35% of our investor base is sort of income based, so that's a pretty significant element of our ownership that is driven, in fact, by the dividend yield, so that's an important aspect of capital allocation going forward. I always say that I think the best indication of what we'll do there is sort of the track record we've had in the last few years or even a decade or more relative to dividend contributions. We still have some options that have yet to be exercised. The option exercise has -- actually have slowed down quite a bit. If I remember, Sam, you've been following us long enough. Years ago, we had a lot of dilution as a result of options being exercised. That level has come down quite a bit, but there's still a backlog of options out there that as those do get exercised, we will clearly do share repurchases to offset that dilution. We will do share repurchases to offset dilution from the equity compensation as well. And then from that point, Sam, as usual, this may or may not be the most satisfying answer you'll get, but as usual, it sort of depends on what's available in terms of capital allocation at that time, including other opportunities to invest in programs, acquisitions, that sort of thing. The one thing that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, at least at this point, is to let it just sit sort of idly on the balance sheet, making as little interest as in fact it does. I'll remind you and I know you know this, Sam, but the RMT transaction will reduce share count pretty significantly on its own, probably somewhere between 9 million and 10 million shares at sort of current trading.

I -- like I -- I'm very happy with the first half of the year, and [indiscernible] of that, but I used the word surprised. But I'll say we were pleasantly higher than expected or higher than planned for a couple of items, including, for instance, the ULA equity earnings that we guided in the quarter. Some of this was sort of fortuitous in terms of the mix of launch vehicles, also the pricing of the launch vehicles that we had in the quarter for ULA. So for instance, we had in Atlas, our -- excuse me, a delta-heavy launch, which is the most expensive launch vehicle that ULA produces, went off in the second quarter. That helped the earnings in the second quarter. Things like that, again, for the first half of the year all helped us. You're quizzing a little bit about while that didn't necessarily translate into the full year. I'll say we kind of gave the first half performance in the outlook for the year, and we definitely have the opportunities that I think you're alluding to, Doug, in the second half of the year, but we have to make those happen, and sometimes things don't work out as planned, and that's probably the reason that we provided the guidance that we did.

Good question, Myles. So look, I kind of in the answer to the question from Doug. I'd like to think we have sort of, as I've said in previous calls, the same sort of opportunities to have a good second half as we had in the first half. The one probably most notable change from first half to second half is the fact that we had some F-35 production step-ups in the first half of the year, particularly on sort of the winding down of LRIP 7 aircraft deliveries and little bit of step-up on LRIT 8 -- LRIP 8, excuse me, as we go into a higher ramp right there. We don't currently have plans for F-35 production step-ups for the rest or for the second half of the year, and so that's one of the things that will cause the second half of the year to look a little lighter probably in the first half of the year. And then secondly, the volume level of F-35, as I alluded to, and the reason for the change in our guidance for the year is really significant -- is really expected to be higher in the second half, and that has that dilutive effect on the overall margins of Aeronautics that I've talked about in the past. So those 2 reasons probably both netted to F-35. One was the step-ups that occurred in the first half and secondly -- excuse me, it's just the volume in the second half."

I'll tell you, I'm really excited about a couple of things, Howard, that we've seen in the past 6 months. First off, we're tracking to what we have planned. I mean, well, from your perspective may be different, but frankly, we're right on plan with what we track. But what I'm excited about is some of the revenue synergies that we see just by getting the integration process well underway and getting our teams together. For example, we were -- I was at the Farnborough airshow, as I mentioned earlier, and we showcased an armed Black Hawk helicopter that's taking weapons systems and sensors and things from our Missiles and Fire Control business combining it with the platform that's in Mission Systems and Training Sikorsky business and showcasing that on -- at our chalet there in Farnborough, and we had tremendous amount of interest in it. A lot of customers are now following up with us on -- and interest there, so that's just one example. We've got many other examples where our teams are getting together, and we see a chance to do just what we thought when we purchased Sikorsky and that is, to not only get the cost synergies of bringing that element into our business but also -- but more importantly, to get the revenue synergies and get the growth moving forward on it. So we're on track. We've talked before in this call about our commercial line of Sikorsky and the oil and gas price pressures on that business, but we've been very frank about where we stand on that and based on what our outlook was and what we set for the year, we're right on track with that as well."

So you should think of this as essentially taking a utility helicopter platform and essentially transitioning it into an attack platform. The interesting thing from the way the design was conceived and the way it will be sold internationally especially is you can remove that capability. So within a day's time or so, the weapons packages and so forth that are put on to make this an armed platform can be removed from the helicopter, and the next day it can go out and perform a mission of a utility helicopter. That's some flexibility that doesn't exist right now in the marketplace, and that's something that we think is very interesting that frankly would not have happened but for the synergy between our Missiles and Fire Control organization, the -- our MST organization and obviously, Sikorsky now."

It's -- we've got it, it's the T-50A, our joint venture with Korean Aerospace. It's flying right now. We've already had our first flight of our offerings, so we've taken that T-50 with KAI and converted it into T-50A to meet the requirements that the Air Force has outlined, and we're excited about the fact that we've flown it, we're demonstrating it, and we think we have an excellent offering. And the RFP appears to be slipping out. It's slipping out into the December time frame. So we'll -- I think that -- what I understand is that the Air Force wants to revisit what they've outlined as the requirements for that capability, and they will slip the RFP out some, and we stand ready to support that. But in the meantime, we are continuing to roll out our capabilities and showcase that capability. It's a big program. It's about 350 aircraft, so it's an opportunity for us. In our case, there is some discussion around whether or not the Air Force wants to pursue a clean sheet design or an existing design. We believe that with tremendous gap on the training capabilities, the T-38 is -- I don't think it's close to 50 years old or something like that. It's -- they need to replace that aircraft, and the fact that we have a low-risk aircraft that's already flying, that can meet today's requirements, we think we're offering something that would allow the U.S. Air Force to move forward on the program and meet that capability. There are other offerings out there as well that are not clean sheet, and so we'd like to compete, and we think we have a tremendous offering."

So relative to the share count reduction and whether or not that's enough to sort of offset the dilution effects of losing the IS&GS earnings or not, you're right at the call. When we announced the deal back in January, we said that the share buyback was essentially going to be enough to make that sort of neutral between the 2 years. Since that time, our stock has increased. If I look at today, it's up almost 25% over what the number was in January. I think we were trading at around $210 a share the day we announced the deal. So pretty significant increase on our side, which makes it obviously more expensive to buy back the same number of shares as we had expected in the January call. On the other hand, the Leidos stock price has dropped a little bit since that time, so both of those are sort of working against us from a shares perspective that will be taken out as a result of the RMT transaction. So as we sit today, George, even with the $1.8 billion, it's probably difficult to get exactly to neutral, but it gets a lot closer there. We still think the economics of this deal relative to all options that we looked at, an outright sale, a pure spin, this is still the best situation for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders, and we don't have regret on that, notwithstanding the fact that, to your point, we actually may see a little bit of EPS dilution as a result of the stock price movement. I think that's a little bit of a high-class problem that we're experiencing right now, but nonetheless, that is where we are. As to the charge we took, we did take an additional charge, $30 million, you're right. This is sort of the command-and-control business that we're looking. So think of this as sort of a system that controls all sorts of air missile defense capabilities around an entire country, including identifying friend or foes so that you don't have the wrong issues with that air missile defense capability. So linking into a lot of different systems, but we think we have prospects once this system is developed in other places internationally, but we've had some growing pains, obviously with this, and I think as we've gone through the development and early stages of this program, the customer has kind of changed some of what their expectations are, so we are in discussions with the customer right now about sort of closure of this contract. We think where it sits right now, it's pretty well-positioned in terms of the charges we've taken. There is some upside potential to that, depending on where the customer wants to head. There could be some downside, so we're kind of in the middle of that right now, George, and obviously, we'll keep you apprized as we go through future quarters and let you know how we're performing on that contract."

Thanks, David, and I probably wasn't at my clearest when I made that reference in the first quarter. I think I heard feedback as we went around in investor conferences and so forth that I -- I think I stumbled with my answer there quite honestly, so I try to be clearer this time. Obviously I'm still not being clear, but let me try to be as crystal clear as I can on this thing. So FAS/CAS in 2016, the benefit is about $975 million or so. What I said is I would expect to be between -- if we struck the line in the sand right now, probably $350 million to $400 million lower than the 2016 FAS/CAS benefit in 2017. I mean, to do the math, that kind of translates into $625 million, $600-ish million income number, down considerably from what we were talking about in the first quarter of last year, almost all of that because of the discount rate change in the 1,000 basis -- or not 1,000, 100 basis points as I talked about. Importantly, back to Rich's question, it's a noncash item, will not affect our 2017 contributions at all, and that relates to your question relative to the $1.8 billion and would we use that to fund and prefund a pension plan. The answer is we don't have that expectation sitting here today, and I don't think that's what we will do with the money. As I said earlier in the -- to another question, I think the more likely outcome is probably share repurchases at this point in time, and we'll fund the 2018 requirement in 2018. We've already got, quite honestly, a fairly sizable prepayment credit balance in terms of how much we have contributed to ERISA versus what we've collected from our government contracts, and we don't see the point at this time to sort of increasing that level."

So we would not recover as much cash under a UCA although we would still get a significant amount of cash under a UCA funding mechanism as we would if we actually definitize the contract because under the LRIP 9 and 10 we would expect to have performance-based payments. And performance-based payments, where we are in the contract today, would actually give us greater cash recovery then with the UCA. I hope that made sense. As to impact on margins and so forth, I wouldn't expect one or the other to have any impact whatsoever on the margins we're negotiating [ph]. The only sort of economic impact that we're seeing, and we have raised this with the government, is depending on how long this shortfall lasts, and I gave you some numbers relative to the shortfall, we could be -- if we choose to fund -- and again, avoid the disruption of the -- particularly, the supply chain on the program and the international partners on the program, if we chose to fund, we probably would have to get in the commercial paper market bigger than we are, and that's not something we look forward to and that's probably something that we'd have to have a conversation about what's equitable if, in fact, that takes place with the government. So potential for a negative on the commercial paper, but we would expect that there -- potentials could be some consideration for that if, in fact, that's what happened. But that is not our plan, as I said."

We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong q",1588,"Thanks, Jerry.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, operationally and financially. The corporation continues to track towards another year of strong financial results while returning value to stockholders and delivering critical solutions to customers.
I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including the status of the strategic transactions in which our Information Systems & Global Solutions business will be separated from Lockheed Martin and combined with Leidos, and I'll share some noteworthy operational achievements in our business areas.
Turning to the summary financials. Our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, with second quarter numbers exceeding all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. If the divestiture of IS&GS is completed in the third quarter as currently anticipated, we will revise our 2016 financial outlook during our call with you in October.
Switching to IS&GS and the status of its combination with Leidos. Significant progress towards transaction closure continues to be achieved. We commenced our exchange offer on Monday of last week. Also last week, the competition in markets authority in the United Kingdom concluded its review, satisfying another closed -- condition to closing. As we outlined in our press release last week announcing the start of the exchange period, the offer provides Lockheed Martin stockholders the opportunity to exchange their shares of Lockheed Martin for shares of stock in a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which then become shares of Leidos common stock upon completion of the transaction. As you are aware, the combination of IS&GS with Leidos is structured as a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We will then retire the shares of Lockheed Martin stock exchanged, achieving a significant reduction in our outstanding share count. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, and closing is currently scheduled for August 16.
Switching to operational highlights. I'll start with some key accomplishments and events on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall, the program continued to achieve good progress across the multiple fronts of winding down development activities, ramping up production rate and sustainment activities and securing customer support and demand. On the development program, key events this quarter included surpassing 60,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations and maturity of the aircraft. We are also achieving increased stability in the software on the aircraft and in the ground support equipment. We continue to make strides in software development on the aircraft and in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, known as ALIS, that is used to maintain the F-35 planes. Evidence of this progress was demonstrated last month in Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho where F-35 fighters were deployed to a remote site to test aircraft performance and mission availability using the latest version of the maturing software. During this deployment, the aircraft successfully cleared 88 of 88 sorties while also achieving 100% on-time performance of the sorties. Additionally, the aircraft achieved 0 avionic shutdowns on the ground or in flight due to any software stability issues.
The deployment met all of the customer's tactical objectives and proved that the aircraft can successfully operate at remote locations away from its home base. These successful series of tests are key milestones in preparation of the F-35 CTOL fleet to achieve initial operational capability for the U.S. Air Force later this year. During the deployment test at the Mountain Home Base, the F-35 had the opportunity to engage with frontline legacy aircraft and performed exceptionally well in mock combat engagements. The tremendous technological leap and capabilities that the F-35 provides are being demonstrated on a daily basis to a growing number of domestic and international customers as the aircraft is fielded at additional sites.
With the future price of an F-35 estimated to approach the price of a legacy fighter, the unmatched capability of fifth-generation stealth provided by the Joint Strike Fighter becomes even more compelling to customers as they capitalize -- recapitalize their fighter fleets.
Looking at the production activities on the program, progress continues to be made in ramping up the rate of production and reducing the cost of the aircraft. On production, we are on track to increase our deliveries to 53 aircraft this year and have delivered approximately 180 aircraft since program inception. In the area of cost reductions, we continue to make significant progress on our previously announced Blueprint for Affordability shared commitment between the government and industry. To build upon that success, we announced 2 additional cost reduction initiatives last week at Farnborough. The first action is a 2-year extension of our cost savings investment that is designed to achieve life cycle savings of more than $4 billion over the remaining production run of aircraft. Additionally, we also announced an initiative over the next couple of years to reduce sustainment cost by 10%. This action is expected to achieve $1 billion in savings for the 5-year period and includes projects such as spare parts block buys and establishing ALIS regional sustainment centers.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35. Key milestones this past quarter on the domestic side include revalidation to Congress by the Department of Defense of the critical and unchanged procurement requirement to replace legacy aircraft with 2,443 JSF fighters for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Internationally, support remains strong and growing, with key events that included: selection of the F-35 by the Danish Parliament as their next-generation fighter with the procurement of 27 aircraft; rollout of the first F-35A for Israel at our Fort Worth facility; and the arrival of the first 2 F-35A fighters into the Netherlands. I was able to see firsthand the growing international interest and support of the F-35 earlier this month when I had the opportunity to attend both the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough air shows in the United Kingdom. Customers and attendees were able to see up close the revolutionary capabilities of both CTOL and STOVL F-35 aircraft at the air shows as they performed their aerial maneuvers. This marked the debut of the F-35 at major international air shows, demonstrating the increasing maturity and progress on the program. We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively field this next-generation fighter for decades to come.
Turning to other areas in the corporation. A noteworthy accomplishment was achieved on our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The test helicopters on the development program continue to progress through a series of increasing payload lift weights to validate capabilities. Recently, the aircraft successfully lifted a 27,000-pound external load, satisfying the contractual requirement for maximum lift weight. With more than triple the payload of the predecessor CH-53E, the new helicopter can accommodate a range of missions. The CH-53K can execute heavy lift missions more effectively and safely in day and night, in all weather conditions using its modern glass cockpit. To date, we have delivered 3 CH-53K helicopters on the development program that are enabling testing to move ahead and support the service's goal to achieve initial operational capability planned in 2019. Providing this enhanced capability is essential to our war fighters, and the Department of Defense program of record continues to project procurement of 200 CH-53K aircraft to replace aging legacy helicopters. The CH-53K is also generating growing interest from multiple countries in addition to that in the United States and offers opportunities to expand production levels beyond the quantities required on the Marine Corps program.
I will conclude my remarks by offering my congratulations to our Space Systems team for their flawless support of NASA's interplanetary mission to insert the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft was designed and constructed by our space personnel in Colorado and has been operated as a joint team with NASA. After launch in August 2011, the spacecraft traveled 1.8 billion miles to Jupiter at speeds of up to 165,000 miles per hour for almost 5 years before successfully settling into orbit on July 4. Juno will spend nearly 2 years orbiting the planet while setting the structure, origin, atmosphere and magnetosphere of Jupiter for NASA. The successful orbit-insertion mission exemplifies the unmatched capability of our corporation and making the impossible possible for our customers. There were no second chances for this orbital insertion, and our spacecraft and teammates performed flawlessly in achieving mission success.
Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to offer my appreciation and thanks to our IS&GS team. Their dedication and continued focus on mission execution and our customers during this extended transitional phase has been superb. For the upcoming closure of the transaction with Leidos, I am certain that the IS&GS efforts have made the business even stronger and helped position the new enterprise to generate value for shareholders and opportunities for employees as they move forward.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."

Good morning, everyone.As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.",1363,"Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone.
As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.
Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, well ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.32 in the quarter, and we'll discuss each of these metrics in the coming charts.
We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter. And as with last quarter, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All in all, we had a strong quarter and are well-positioned through the first half of the year to achieve our outlook.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.3 billion or 11% this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky in the results of MST for about $1.2 billion and nearly $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by $400 million higher F-35 volume, which more than offset 2 fewer C-5 deliveries in the quarter compared to last year. Segment operating profit was $24 million higher than last year, with the growth coming from the volume at Aeronautics and significantly higher profit in IS&GS and Space Systems. These increases more than offset the effects of purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky as well as the expected reduction of margin at Missiles and Fire Control.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.32, which represents about a 13% increase over the EPS in the second quarter of last year. This year benefited from strong operational performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment and a $0.04 benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in our earnings release.
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash from operations in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was almost $1.5 billion, $200 million more than in the second quarter of last year. This is particularly noteworthy, given that we expected to recover a significant amount of cash associated with the completion of negotiations on F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 by now. Strong cash generation in each of the other 4 business areas beyond Aeronautics, including a large international receipt by Sikorsky, helped to offset the F-35 shortfall. And while we expect to recover that shortfall soon, if additional funding is not received, the investment level will grow dramatically during the coming months.
Turning to Chart 7, you can see the significant amount of cash returned to our stockholders in the quarter. With just over $1 billion returned to stockholders, evenly split between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over 80% of free cash flow in the quarter.
Chart 8 provides an update to our current outlook for the year. As a result of the strong performance in the quarter and prospects for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook by $400 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million. We'll provide additional insight into these improvements in the next 2 charts. We also increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.65, and we'll provide more detail into that increase in a few charts. And we are increasing our cash from operations outlook by $100 million. This obviously assumes that we receive additional F-35 funding as we've already discussed. And as a reminder, our guidance continues to assume the inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business.
Chart 9 provides the updated sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook by $400 million, $350 million in Aeronautics, due primarily to higher-than-planned F-35 volume and $50 million in Space Systems, reflecting the stronger start to the year than we anticipated.
On Chart 10, we show the changes to our segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our profit outlook by $125 million, with $60 million of that increase coming from IS&GS as a result of its strong first half performance. Aeronautics increased by $40 million, driven by the higher sales volume, and Space Systems increased by $25 million, reflecting its better-than-planned performance to date.
Moving to Chart 11. We have a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook compared with the first quarter. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit increases our outlook by $0.25. The newly adopted accounting standard for the treatment of equity-based compensation that we described in our earnings release increased 2016 EPS by $0.45. This change in accounting is reflected as if it had been in place from the beginning of the year. As a result, our year-to-date EPS includes a benefit of $0.37, $0.33 from the first quarter when the majority of our equity-based compensation vested. The remaining 2 quarters of the year are anticipated to receive similar benefits of $0.04 per quarter, totaling to the $0.45 increase for the year. A number of minor other changes in the quarter amounted to a $0.05 reduction to EPS. And combined, these changes increased our EPS outlook by $0.65 for the year.
On Chart 12, we have a reminder of several key financial impacts that we expect when the IS&GS Reverse Morris Trust transaction closes. We'll receive a special cash payment of $1.8 billion. At current trading prices, we would expect to reduce our common shares outstanding by about 10 million shares, though this is obviously subject to change as both Lockheed Martin and Leidos stock prices fluctuate during the exchange period. And we would expect to have a significant book gain when the deal closes. In addition to the deal closure in the third quarter, we expect to have a number of other significant events occur in the quarter as well.
Chart 13 highlights these upcoming financial events. Obviously, the first significant event we are expecting is the IS&GS transaction closure. The year-to-date results of IS&GS through closure will be moved to discontinued operations as will the book gain that we discussed on the prior chart. We also expect to have a net pension gain upon closure associated with the departure of IS&GS employees. This pension gain will be recorded in discontinued operations as well. Corporate costs allocated to IS&GS up to the date of closure will be moved from IS&GS's results and reflected as other unallocated costs and continuing operations. Importantly, there is no economic impact as a result of this cost reclassification, and we'll be filing pro forma financials.
Next, we expect to close on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts and recover the significant operating cash tied to those negotiations. We also expect to increase our ownership and obtain control of a joint venture within Space Systems to manage the atomic weapons establishment in the U.K. A book gain will be recognized in our operating results upon closure of the transaction. Going forward, we will fully consolidate AWE's financials and continue to report its operating results in our Space Systems segment. Then, we expect to finalize our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments next quarter. And lastly, we'll provide our trend information for 2017, including an updated discount rate projection and its impact on our expected FAS/CAS adjustment. So you can see that we anticipate a number of moving pieces in the quarter, some of which are individually significant, but collectively, will be quite significant. We'll provide updated guidance for all these events during our next earnings call in October.
Finally on Chart 14, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter and that led to increases in our outlook. The IS&GS exchange offer has begun, which places us on the path to close the transaction in the middle of August, and we remain focused on providing outstanding products and services to our customers and strong returns to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Kat [ph]?"

Had a -- for whatever reason, the U.S. government has not decided to put funds that are authorized and appropriated to fund Lockheed Martin and our subcontractor efforts on the contracts, so we've been -- we made the decision at the time that we were going to not allow a stop on the program and cause the disruption on the program, particularly in our supply base, that's -- since that's where most of the work is being done at these -- at this time on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts. So we've been funding that for a while. We continue to ask for funding recovery from the U.S. government. To this point, they have not funded us. At some point in the future because of the growth that we see over the next few months, and you should think of this literally growing, Pete, in the $400 million to $500 million per month sorts of levels. We will not be able to sustain that. So that if we don't either get funding through a funding mechanism such as a UCA funding item or we definitize the contracts, we will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation. We simply don't have that capacity. The Pentagon clearly knows that situation, and I'm optimistic that we're going to get cash soon."

So we're probably a little early to be talking about -- it feels a little early to be talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment here recently, particularly after the Brexit situation. I mean, I think, what, our 10-year treasury is going for 1.4% or thereabouts. So dramatic reduction from the start of the year to now. I think we ended the year at a discount rate of about 4 3/8 or 4.375%. If we were to strike a line in the sand right now, it's probably 100 basis points lower than that. You tell me whether you think it's going to increase between now and the end of the year or not. But if it did not, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate from where we ended last year is worth about $125 million delta to FAS expense. So that's a pretty significant reduction to FAS next year. Our asset returns -- you didn't ask about those, but that's the other component in the mix. The asset returns are actually tracking pretty nicely towards an 8% return. We've had a nice lift in the equity markets, particularly domestically here recently that had helped with that situation. So if I were to predict, again, kind of striking the line in the sand, our current FAS/CAS in 2016 is roughly, what, $975 million or so of income. Looking forward and just carrying those impacts into 2017 that I just described, '17 would probably be $350 million, maybe $400 million lower than 2016, still income from FAS/CAS, if you will, but not as much income as what we've been expecting and talking about previously. As to your cash funding question, there is no impact next year at all associated with the discount rate change. I mean, ERISA is far more -- ERISA, which requires the funding levels for our pension trust, is far more sensitive to asset returns than the discount rate changes. FAS is sort of an instantaneous discount rate impact whereas ERISA's spread over time, so we wouldn't expect any change whatsoever in the funding requirements in 2017. Still 0."

But let me take a shot at it now just because you asked the question. So we have said, the -- 2017, we talked about being the last of the 3-year, what we call, pension-funding holiday that we announced, I guess, at the beginning of 2015. As Rich asked in his question about cash funding, we don't see that changing in 2017. In previous quarters, I did talk about 2018 having a required pension contribution, and obviously, that's still the case. However, what I was trying to convey -- and the number you threw out, about $1.5 billion, it's flowing around there, maybe a little bit higher now. So what I was trying to convey on previous calls and what I'll try to convey on this call is that you shouldn't think of sort of the current level of operating cash dropping by the full amount of pension funding in 2018, and that's really for a couple of reasons. One is we expect to get much stronger cash flows from Sikorsky in 2018 versus what we're seeing today. We expect to have higher cash flow from F-35 than we're seeing today. And then lastly, as you described in your question, we also will get a tax benefit associated with the pension cash contribution in 2018, so think of that as sort of 65%, simplistically, of the cash contribution is what will be a hit to operating cash in that year, if you will."

We have, if you just look at the composition of our sharehold",387,"Yes, let me take a shot at that, Sam. So it's a great question as far as capital allocation plans. We still feel strongly about the dividend capital allocation that we provided to shareholders. We have, if you just look at the composition of our shareholder base, it's probably -- I don't remember, 30%, 35%. I'm looking at Jerry as I say this. 30%, 35% of our investor base is sort of income based, so that's a pretty significant element of our ownership that is driven, in fact, by the dividend yield, so that's an important aspect of capital allocation going forward. I always say that I think the best indication of what we'll do there is sort of the track record we've had in the last few years or even a decade or more relative to dividend contributions. We still have some options that have yet to be exercised. The option exercises actually have slowed down quite a bit. You might remember, Sam, you've been following us long enough, years ago we had a lot of dilution as a result of options being exercised. That level has come down quite a bit, but there's still a backlog of options out there that as those do get exercised, we will clearly do share repurchases to offset that dilution. We will do share repurchases to offset dilution from the equity compensation as well. And then from that point, Sam, as usual, this may or may not be the most satisfying answer you'll get, but as usual, it sort of depends on what's available in terms of capital allocation at that time, including other opportunities to invest in programs, acquisitions, that sort of thing. The one thing that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, at least at this point, is to let it just sit sort of idly on the balance sheet, making as little interest as in fact it does. I'll remind you and I know you know this, Sam, but the RMT transaction will reduce share count pretty significantly on its own, probably somewhere between 9 million and 10 million shares at sort of current trading. And on top of that, we get the $1.8 billion special payment as I talked about and lacking a more pressing or -- what's the word I'm looking for?"

Look I'm very happy with the first half of the year, and I don't look at it -- did I use the word surprised? But I'll say we were pleasantly higher than expected or higher than planned for a couple of items, including, for instance, the ULA equity earnings that we got in the quarter. Some of this was sort of fortuitous in terms of the mix of launch vehicles, also the pricing of the launch vehicles that we had in the quarter for ULA. So for instance, we had an Atlas -- or excuse me, a Delta heavy launch, which is the most expensive launch vehicle that ULA produces, went off to the second quarter. That helped the earnings in the second quarter. Things like that, again, for the first half of the year all helped us. You were quizzing a little bit about why that doesn't necessarily translate into the full year. I'll say we kind of gave the first half performance in the outlook for the year, and we definitely have the opportunities that I think you're alluding to, Doug, in the second half of the year, but we have to make those happen, and sometimes things don't work out as planned, and that's probably the reason that we provided the guidance that we did.

Good question, Myles. So look, I kind of in the answer to the question from Doug. I'd like to think we have sort of, as I've said in previous calls, the same sort of opportunities to have a good second half as we had in the first half. The one probably most notable change from first half to second half is the fact that we had some F-35 production step-ups in the first half of the year, particularly on sort of the winding down of LRIP 7 aircraft deliveries and little bit of step-up on LRIT 8 -- LRIP 8, excuse me, as we go into a higher ramp right there. We don't currently have plans for F-35 production step-ups for the rest or for the second half of the year, and so that's one of the things that will cause the second half of the year to look a little lighter probably than the first half of the year. And then secondly, the volume level of F-35, as I alluded to, and the reason for the change in our guidance for the year is really significant -- is really expected to be higher in the second half, and that has that dilutive effect on the overall margins of Aeronautics that I've talked about in the past. So those 2 reasons probably both netted to F-35. One was the step-ups that occurred in the first half and secondly -- excuse me, it's just the volume in the second half."

I mean, well, from your perspective may be different, but frankly, we're right on plan with what we track. But what I'm excited about is some of the revenue synergies that we see just by getting the integration process well underway and getting our teams together. For example, we were -- I was at the Farnborough airshow, as I mentioned earlier, and we showcased an armed Black Hawk helicopter that's taking weapons systems and sensors and things from our Missiles and Fire Control business combining it with the platform that's in Mission Systems and Training Sikorsky business and showcasing that on -- at our chalet there in Farnborough, and we had tremendous amount of interest in it. A lot of customers are now following up with us on -- and interest there, so that's just one example. We've got many other examples where our teams are getting together, and we see a chance to do just what we thought when we purchased Sikorsky and that is, to not only get the cost synergies of bringing that element into our business but also -- but more importantly, to get the revenue synergies and get the growth moving forward on it. So we're on track. We've talked before in this call about our commercial line of Sikorsky and the oil and gas price pressures on that business, but we've been very frank about where we stand on that and based on what our outlook was and what we set for the year, we're right on track with that as well."

The interesting thing from the way the design was conceived and the way it will be sold internationally especially is you can remove that capability. So within a day's time or so, the weapons packages and so forth that are put on to make this an armed platform can be removed from the helicopter, and the next day it can go out and perform a mission of a utility helicopter. That's some flexibility that doesn't exist right now in the marketplace, and that's something that we think is very interesting that frankly would not have happened but for the synergy between our Missiles and Fire Control organization, the -- our MST organization and obviously, Sikorsky now."

And the RFP appears to be slipping out. It's slipping out into the December time frame. So we'll -- I think that -- what I understand is that the Air Force wants to revisit what they've outlined as the requirements for that capability, and they will slip the RFP out some, and we stand ready to support that. But in the meantime, we are continuing to roll out our capabilities and showcase that capability. It's a big program. It's about 350 aircraft, so it's an opportunity for us. In our case, there is some discussion around whether or not the Air Force wants to pursue a clean sheet design or an existing design. We believe that with tremendous gap on the training capabilities, the T-38 is -- I don't think it's close to 50 years old or something like that. It's -- they need to replace that aircraft, and the fact that we have a low-risk aircraft that's already flying, that can meet today's requirements, we think we're offering something that would allow the U.S. Air Force to move forward on the program and meet that capability.

So relative to the share count reduction and whether or not that's enough to sort of offset the dilution effects of losing the IS&GS earnings or not. You're right, at the call when we announced the deal back in January, we said that the share buyback was essentially going to be enough to make that sort of neutral between the 2 years. Since that time, our stock has increased. If I look at today, it's up almost 25% over what the number was in January. I think we were trading at around $210 a share the day we announced the deal. So pretty significant increase on our side, which makes it obviously more expensive to buy back the same number of shares as we had expected in the January call. On the other hand, the Leidos stock price has dropped a little bit since that time, so both of those are sort of working against us from a shares perspective that will be taken out as a result of the RMT transaction. So as we sit today, George, even with the $1.8 billion, it's probably difficult to get exactly to neutral, but it gets a lot closer there. We still think the economics of this deal relative to all options that we looked at, an outright sale, a pure spin, this is still the best situation for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders, and we don't have regret on that, notwithstanding the fact that, to your point, we actually may see a little bit of EPS dilution as a result of the stock price movement. I think that's a little bit of a high-class problem that we're experiencing right now, but nonetheless, that is where we are. 
As to the charge we took, we did take an additional charge, $30 million, you're right. This is sort of the command-and-control business that we're looking -- so think of this as sort of a system that controls all sorts of air missile defense capabilities around an entire country, including identifying friend or foes so that you don't have the wrong issues with that air missile defense capability. So linking into a lot of different systems, but we think we have prospects once this system is developed in other places internationally, but we've had some growing pains, obviously with this, and I think as we've gone through the development and early stages of this program, the customer has kind of changed some of what their expectations are, so we are in discussions with the customer right now about sort of closure of this contract. We think where it sits right now, it's pretty well-positioned in terms of the charges we've taken. There is some upside potential to that, depending on where the customer wants to head. There could be some downside, so we're kind of in the middle of that right now, George, and obviously, we'll keep you apprized as we go through future quarters and let you know how we're performing on that contract."

And right now, we're sort of tracking towards that trajectory. We've not come off that at all."

Thanks, David, and I probably wasn't at my clearest when I made that reference in the first quarter. I think I heard feedback as we went around in -- at investor conferences and so forth that I think I stumbled with my answer there quite honestly, so I tried to be clearer this time. Obviously I'm still not being clear, but let me try to be as crystal clear as I can on this thing. So FAS/CAS in 2016, the benefit is about $975 million or so. What I said is I would expect to be between -- if we struck the line in the sand right now, probably $350 million to $400 million lower than the 2016 FAS/CAS benefit in 2017. I mean, to do the math, that kind of translates into $625 million, $600-ish million income number, down considerably from what we were talking about in the first quarter of last year, almost all of that because of the discount rate changing 1,000 basis -- or not 1,000, 100 basis points as I talked about. Importantly, back to Rich's question, it's a noncash item, will not affect our 2017 contributions at all. 
And that relates to your question relative to the $1.8 billion and would we use that to fund -- prefund a pension plan. The answer is we don't have that expectation sitting here today, and I don't think that's what we will do with the money. As I said earlier in the -- to another question, I think the more likely outcome is probably share repurchases at this point in time, and we'll fund the 2018 requirement in 2018. We've already got, quite honestly, a fairly sizable prepayment credit balance in terms of how much we have contributed to ERISA versus what we've collected from our government contracts, and we don't see the point at this time to sort of increasing that level."

We've got a lot of projects that we've outlined, and so it will be jointly with the U.S. government. They will approve those projects. We'll implement them.

I'll try to address the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10, so maybe a little bit more than you want, Carter, but -- so there are sort of 2 ways that we could get cash recovery on this program. One is through what's called an undefinitized contractual action or a UCA. You've heard that term obviously in the past. We don't care frankly how we get the cash. If it comes under a UCA, though, UCAs get funded essentially and allows you to bill against the UCA with progress payments. So we would not recover as much cash under a UCA although we would still get a significant amount of cash under a UCA funding mechanism as we would if we actually definitize the contract because under the LRIP 9 and 10 we would expect to have performance-based payments. And performance-based payments, where we are in the contract today, would actually give us greater cash recovery then with the UCA. I hope that made sense. 
As to impact on margins and so forth, I wouldn't expect one or the other to have any impact whatsoever on the margins we're negotiating. The only sort of economic impact that we're seeing, and we have raised this with the government, is depending on how long this shortfall lasts, and I gave you some numbers relative to the shortfall, we could be -- if we choose to fund -- and again, avoid the disruption of the -- particularly, the supply chain on the program and the international partners on the program, if we chose to fund, we probably would have to get in the commercial paper market bigger than we are, and that's not something we look forward to and that's probably something that we'd have to have a conversation about what's equitable if, in fact, that takes place with the government. So potential for a negative on the commercial paper, but we would expect that there potentially could be some consideration for that if, in fact, that's what happened. But that is not our plan, as I said."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016. As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter, operationally and financially. The corporation continues to track towards another year of strong financial results while returning value to stockholders and delivering critical solutions to customers.
I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including the status of the strategic transactions in which our Information Systems & Global Solutions business will be separated from Lockheed Martin and combined with Leidos, and I'll share some noteworthy operational achievements in our business areas.
Turning to the summary financials. Our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, with second quarter numbers exceeding all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. If the divestiture of IS&GS is completed in the third quarter as currently anticipated, we will revise our 2016 financial outlook during our call with you in October.
Switching to IS&GS and the status of its combination with Leidos. Significant progress towards transaction closure continues to be achieved. We commenced our exchange offer on Monday of last week. Also last week, the competition in markets authority in the United Kingdom concluded its review, satisfying another closed -- condition to closing. As we outlined in our press release last week announcing the start of the exchange period, the offer provides Lockheed Martin stockholders the opportunity to exchange their shares of Lockheed Martin for shares of stock in a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which then become shares of Leidos common stock upon completion of the transaction. As you are aware, the combination of IS&GS with Leidos is structured as a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We will then retire the shares of Lockheed Martin stock exchanged, achieving a significant reduction in our outstanding share count. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, and closing is currently scheduled for August 16.
Switching to operational highlights. I'll start with some key accomplishments and events on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall, the program continued to achieve good progress across the multiple fronts of winding down development activities, ramping up production rate and sustainment activities and securing customer support and demand. On the development program, key events this quarter included surpassing 60,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations and maturity of the aircraft. We are also achieving increased stability in the software on the aircraft and in the ground support equipment. We continue to make strides in software development on the aircraft and in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, known as ALIS, that is used to maintain the F-35 planes. Evidence of this progress was demonstrated last month in Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho where F-35 fighters were deployed to a remote site to test aircraft performance and mission availability using the latest version of the maturing software. During this deployment, the aircraft successfully cleared 88 of 88 sorties while also achieving 100% on-time performance of the sorties. Additionally, the aircraft achieved 0 avionic shutdowns on the ground or in flight due to any software stability issues.
The deployment met all of the customer's tactical objectives and proved that the aircraft can successfully operate at remote locations away from its home base. These successful series of tests are key milestones in preparation of the F-35 CTOL fleet to achieve initial operational capability for the U.S. Air Force later this year. During the deployment test at the Mountain Home Base, the F-35 had the opportunity to engage with frontline legacy aircraft and performed exceptionally well in mock combat engagements. The tremendous technological leap and capabilities that the F-35 provides are being demonstrated on a daily basis to a growing number of domestic and international customers as the aircraft is fielded at additional sites.
With the future price of an F-35 estimated to approach the price of a legacy fighter, the unmatched capability of fifth-generation stealth provided by the Joint Strike Fighter becomes even more compelling to customers as they capitalize -- recapitalize their fighter fleets.
Looking at the production activities on the program, progress continues to be made in ramping up the rate of production and reducing the cost of the aircraft. On production, we are on track to increase our deliveries to 53 aircraft this year and have delivered approximately 180 aircraft since program inception. In the area of cost reductions, we continue to make significant progress on our previously announced Blueprint for Affordability shared commitment between the government and industry. To build upon that success, we announced 2 additional cost reduction initiatives last week at Farnborough. The first action is a 2-year extension of our cost savings investment that is designed to achieve life cycle savings of more than $4 billion over the remaining production run of aircraft. Additionally, we also announced an initiative over the next couple of years to reduce sustainment cost by 10%. This action is expected to achieve $1 billion in savings for the 5-year period and includes projects such as spare parts block buys and establishing ALIS regional sustainment centers.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35. Key milestones this past quarter on the domestic side include revalidation to Congress by the Department of Defense of the critical and unchanged procurement requirement to replace legacy aircraft with 2,443 JSF fighters for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Internationally, support remains strong and growing, with key events that included: selection of the F-35 by the Danish Parliament as their next-generation fighter with the procurement of 27 aircraft; rollout of the first F-35A for Israel at our Fort Worth facility; and the arrival of the first 2 F-35A fighters into the Netherlands. I was able to see firsthand the growing international interest and support of the F-35 earlier this month when I had the opportunity to attend both the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough air shows in the United Kingdom. Customers and attendees were able to see up close the revolutionary capabilities of both CTOL and STOVL F-35 aircraft at the air shows as they performed their aerial maneuvers. This marked the debut of the F-35 at major international air shows, demonstrating the increasing maturity and progress on the program. We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively field this next-generation fighter for decades to come.
Turning to other areas in the corporation. A noteworthy accomplishment was achieved on our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The test helicopters on the development program continue to progress through a series of increasing payload lift weights to validate capabilities. Recently, the aircraft successfully lifted a 27,000-pound external load, satisfying the contractual requirement for maximum lift weight. With more than triple the payload of the predecessor CH-53E, the new helicopter can accommodate a range of missions. The CH-53K can execute heavy lift missions more effectively and safely in day and night, in all weather conditions using its modern glass cockpit. To date, we have delivered 3 CH-53K helicopters on the development program that are enabling testing to move ahead and support the service's goal to achieve initial operational capability planned in 2019. Providing this enhanced capability is essential to our war fighters, and the Department of Defense program of record continues to project procurement of 200 CH-53K aircraft to replace aging legacy helicopters. The CH-53K is also generating growing interest from multiple countries in addition to that in the United States and offers opportunities to expand production levels beyond the quantities required on the Marine Corps program.
I will conclude my remarks by offering my congratulations to our Space Systems team for their flawless support of NASA's interplanetary mission to insert the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft was designed and constructed by our space personnel in Colorado and has been operated as a joint team with NASA. After launch in August 2011, the spacecraft traveled 1.8 billion miles to Jupiter at speeds of up to 165,000 miles per hour for almost 5 years before successfully settling into orbit on July 4. Juno will spend nearly 2 years orbiting the planet while setting the structure, origin, atmosphere and magnetosphere of Jupiter for NASA. The successful orbit-insertion mission exemplifies the unmatched capability of our corporation and making the impossible possible for our customers. There were no second chances for this orbital insertion, and our spacecraft and teammates performed flawlessly in achieving mission success.
Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to offer my appreciation and thanks to our IS&GS team. Their dedication and continued focus on mission execution and our customers during this extended transitional phase has been superb. For the upcoming closure of the transaction with Leidos, I am certain that the IS&GS efforts have made the business even stronger and helped position the new enterprise to generate value for shareholders and opportunities for employees as they move forward.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."

Good morning, everyone.As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.",1363,"Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone.
As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. I'll start with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter.
Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, well ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.32 in the quarter, and we'll discuss each of these metrics in the coming charts.
We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter. And as with last quarter, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All in all, we had a strong quarter and are well-positioned through the first half of the year to achieve our outlook.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.3 billion or 11% this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky in the results of MST for about $1.2 billion and nearly $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by $400 million higher F-35 volume, which more than offset 2 fewer C-5 deliveries in the quarter compared to last year. Segment operating profit was $24 million higher than last year, with the growth coming from the volume at Aeronautics and significantly higher profit in IS&GS and Space Systems. These increases more than offset the effects of purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky as well as the expected reduction of margin at Missiles and Fire Control.
On Chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.32, which represents about a 13% increase over the EPS in the second quarter of last year. This year benefited from strong operational performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment and a $0.04 benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in our earnings release.
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll review our cash from operations in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was almost $1.5 billion, $200 million more than in the second quarter of last year. This is particularly noteworthy, given that we expected to recover a significant amount of cash associated with the completion of negotiations on F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 by now. Strong cash generation in each of the other 4 business areas beyond Aeronautics, including a large international receipt by Sikorsky, helped to offset the F-35 shortfall. And while we expect to recover that shortfall soon, if additional funding is not received, the investment level will grow dramatically during the coming months.
Turning to Chart 7, you can see the significant amount of cash returned to our stockholders in the quarter. With just over $1 billion returned to stockholders, evenly split between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over 80% of free cash flow in the quarter.
Chart 8 provides an update to our current outlook for the year. As a result of the strong performance in the quarter and prospects for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook by $400 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million. We'll provide additional insight into these improvements in the next 2 charts. We also increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.65, and we'll provide more detail into that increase in a few charts. And we are increasing our cash from operations outlook by $100 million. This obviously assumes that we receive additional F-35 funding as we've already discussed. And as a reminder, our guidance continues to assume the inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business.
Chart 9 provides the updated sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook by $400 million, $350 million in Aeronautics, due primarily to higher-than-planned F-35 volume and $50 million in Space Systems, reflecting the stronger start to the year than we anticipated.
On Chart 10, we show the changes to our segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our profit outlook by $125 million, with $60 million of that increase coming from IS&GS as a result of its strong first half performance. Aeronautics increased by $40 million, driven by the higher sales volume, and Space Systems increased by $25 million, reflecting its better-than-planned performance to date.
Moving to Chart 11. We have a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook compared with the first quarter. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit increases our outlook by $0.25. The newly adopted accounting standard for the treatment of equity-based compensation that we described in our earnings release increased 2016 EPS by $0.45. This change in accounting is reflected as if it had been in place from the beginning of the year. As a result, our year-to-date EPS includes a benefit of $0.37, $0.33 from the first quarter when the majority of our equity-based compensation vested. The remaining 2 quarters of the year are anticipated to receive similar benefits of $0.04 per quarter, totaling to the $0.45 increase for the year. A number of minor other changes in the quarter amounted to a $0.05 reduction to EPS. And combined, these changes increased our EPS outlook by $0.65 for the year.
On Chart 12, we have a reminder of several key financial impacts that we expect when the IS&GS Reverse Morris Trust transaction closes. We'll receive a special cash payment of $1.8 billion. At current trading prices, we would expect to reduce our common shares outstanding by about 10 million shares, though this is obviously subject to change as both Lockheed Martin and Leidos stock prices fluctuate during the exchange period. And we would expect to have a significant book gain when the deal closes. In addition to the deal closure in the third quarter, we expect to have a number of other significant events occur in the quarter as well.
Chart 13 highlights these upcoming financial events. Obviously, the first significant event we are expecting is the IS&GS transaction closure. The year-to-date results of IS&GS through closure will be moved to discontinued operations as will the book gain that we discussed on the prior chart. We also expect to have a net pension gain upon closure associated with the departure of IS&GS employees. This pension gain will be recorded in discontinued operations as well. Corporate costs allocated to IS&GS up to the date of closure will be moved from IS&GS's results and reflected as other unallocated costs and continuing operations. Importantly, there is no economic impact as a result of this cost reclassification, and we'll be filing pro forma financials.
Next, we expect to close on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts and recover the significant operating cash tied to those negotiations. We also expect to increase our ownership and obtain control of a joint venture within Space Systems to manage the atomic weapons establishment in the U.K. A book gain will be recognized in our operating results upon closure of the transaction. Going forward, we will fully consolidate AWE's financials and continue to report its operating results in our Space Systems segment. Then, we expect to finalize our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments next quarter. And lastly, we'll provide our trend information for 2017, including an updated discount rate projection and its impact on our expected FAS/CAS adjustment. So you can see that we anticipate a number of moving pieces in the quarter, some of which are individually significant, but collectively, will be quite significant. We'll provide updated guidance for all these events during our next earnings call in October.
Finally on Chart 14, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter and that led to increases in our outlook. The IS&GS exchange offer has begun, which places us on the path to close the transaction in the middle of August, and we remain focused on providing outstanding products and services to our customers and strong returns to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Kat [ph]?"

So we've been funding that for a while. We continue to ask for funding recovery from the U.S. government. To this point, they have not funded us. At some point in the future because of the growth that we see over the next few months, and you should think of this literally growing, Pete, in the $400 million to $500 million per month sorts of levels. We will not be able to sustain that. So that if we don't either get funding through a funding mechanism such as a UCA funding item or we definitize the contracts, we will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation.

So we're probably a little early to be talking about -- it feels a little early to be talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment here recent",374,"Yes. I'll take that one, Rich. So we're probably a little early to be talking about -- it feels a little early to be talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment here recently, particularly after the Brexit situation. I mean, I think, what, our 10-year treasury is going for 1.4% or thereabouts. So dramatic reduction from the start of the year to now. I think we ended the year at a discount rate of about 4 3/8 or 4.375%. If we were to strike a line in the sand right now, it's probably 100 basis points lower than that. You tell me whether you think it's going to increase between now and the end of the year or not. But if it did not, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate from where we ended last year is worth about $125 million delta to FAS expense. So that's a pretty significant reduction to FAS next year. Our asset returns -- you didn't ask about those, but that's the other component in the mix. The asset returns are actually tracking pretty nicely towards an 8% return. We've had a nice lift in the equity markets, particularly domestically here recently that had helped with that situation. So if I were to predict, again, kind of striking the line in the sand, our current FAS/CAS in 2016 is roughly, what, $975 million or so of income. Looking forward and just carrying those impacts into 2017 that I just described, '17 would probably be $350 million, maybe $400 million lower than 2016, still income from FAS/CAS, if you will, but not as much income as what we've been expecting and talking about previously. As to your cash funding question, there is no impact next year at all associated with the discount rate change. I mean, ERISA is far more -- ERISA, which requires the funding levels for our pension trust, is far more sensitive to asset returns than the discount rate changes. FAS is sort of an instantaneous discount rate impact whereas ERISA's spread over time, so we wouldn't expect any change whatsoever in the funding requirements in 2017. Still 0."

But let me take a shot at it now just because you asked the question. So we have said, the -- 2017, we talked about being the last of the 3-year, what we call, pension-funding holiday that we announced, I guess, at the beginning of 2015. As Rich asked in his question about cash funding, we don't see that changing in 2017. In previous quarters, I did talk about 2018 having a required pension contribution, and obviously, that's still the case. However, what I was trying to convey -- and the number you threw out, about $1.5 billion, it's flowing around there, maybe a little bit higher now. So what I was trying to convey on previous calls and what I'll try to convey on this call is that you shouldn't think of sort of the current level of operating cash dropping by the full amount of pension funding in 2018, and that's really for a couple of reasons. One is we expect to get much stronger cash flows from Sikorsky in 2018 versus what we're seeing today. We expect to have higher cash flow from F-35 than we're seeing today. And then lastly, as you described in your question, we also will get a tax benefit associated with the pension cash contribution in 2018, so think of that as sort of 65%, simplistically, of the cash contribution is what will be a hit to operating cash in that year, if you will."

We have, if you just look at the composition of our sharehold",387,"Yes, let me take a shot at that, Sam. So it's a great question as far as capital allocation plans. We still feel strongly about the dividend capital allocation that we provided to shareholders. We have, if you just look at the composition of our shareholder base, it's probably -- I don't remember, 30%, 35%. I'm looking at Jerry as I say this. 30%, 35% of our investor base is sort of income based, so that's a pretty significant element of our ownership that is driven, in fact, by the dividend yield, so that's an important aspect of capital allocation going forward. I always say that I think the best indication of what we'll do there is sort of the track record we've had in the last few years or even a decade or more relative to dividend contributions. We still have some options that have yet to be exercised. The option exercises actually have slowed down quite a bit. You might remember, Sam, you've been following us long enough, years ago we had a lot of dilution as a result of options being exercised. That level has come down quite a bit, but there's still a backlog of options out there that as those do get exercised, we will clearly do share repurchases to offset that dilution. We will do share repurchases to offset dilution from the equity compensation as well. And then from that point, Sam, as usual, this may or may not be the most satisfying answer you'll get, but as usual, it sort of depends on what's available in terms of capital allocation at that time, including other opportunities to invest in programs, acquisitions, that sort of thing. The one thing that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, at least at this point, is to let it just sit sort of idly on the balance sheet, making as little interest as in fact it does. I'll remind you and I know you know this, Sam, but the RMT transaction will reduce share count pretty significantly on its own, probably somewhere between 9 million and 10 million shares at sort of current trading.

But I'll say we were pleasantly higher than expected or higher than planned for a couple of items, including, for instance, the ULA equity earnings that we got in the quarter. Some of this was sort of fortuitous in terms of the mix of launch vehicles, also the pricing of the launch vehicles that we had in the quarter for ULA. So for instance, we had an Atlas -- or excuse me, a Delta heavy launch, which is the most expensive launch vehicle that ULA produces, went off to the second quarter. That helped the earnings in the second quarter. Things like that, again, for the first half of the year all helped us. You were quizzing a little bit about why that doesn't necessarily translate into the full year.

Good question, Myles. So look, I kind of in the answer to the question from Doug. I'd like to think we have sort of, as I've said in previous calls, the same sort of opportunities to have a good second half as we had in the first half. The one probably most notable change from first half to second half is the fact that we had some F-35 production step-ups in the first half of the year, particularly on sort of the winding down of LRIP 7 aircraft deliveries and little bit of step-up on LRIT 8 -- LRIP 8, excuse me, as we go into a higher ramp right there. We don't currently have plans for F-35 production step-ups for the rest or for the second half of the year, and so that's one of the things that will cause the second half of the year to look a little lighter probably than the first half of the year. And then secondly, the volume level of F-35, as I alluded to, and the reason for the change in our guidance for the year is really significant -- is really expected to be higher in the second half, and that has that dilutive effect on the overall margins of Aeronautics that I've talked about in the past.

We have Dan Schultz who has run large business areas -- businesses for us in the past and also is a helicopter pilot out of the Marine Corps, so he knows the business extremely well and doing a great job there. I'll tell you, I'm really excited about a couple of things, Howard, that we've seen in the past 6 months. First off, we're tracking to what we had planned. I mean, well, from your perspective may be different, but frankly, we're right on plan with what we track. But what I'm excited about is some of the revenue synergies that we see just by getting the integration process well underway and getting our teams together. For example, we were -- I was at the Farnborough airshow, as I mentioned earlier, and we showcased an armed Black Hawk helicopter that's taking weapons systems and sensors and things from our Missiles and Fire Control business combining it with the platform that's in Mission Systems and Training Sikorsky business and showcasing that on -- at our chalet there in Farnborough, and we had tremendous amount of interest in it. A lot of customers are now following up with us on -- and interest there, so that's just one example. We've got many other examples where our teams are getting together, and we see a chance to do just what we thought when we purchased Sikorsky and that is, to not only get the cost synergies of bringing that element into our business but also -- but more importantly, to get the revenue synergies and get the growth moving forward on it. So we're on track. We've talked before in this call about our commercial line of Sikorsky and the oil and gas price pressures on that business, but we've been very frank about where we stand on that and based on what our outlook was and what we set for the year, we're right on track with that as well."

So you should think of this as essentially taking a utility helicopter platform and essentially transitioning it into an attack platform. The interesting thing from the way the design was conceived and the way it will be sold internationally especially is you can remove that capability. So within a day's time or so, the weapons packages and so forth that are put on to make this an armed platform can be removed from the helicopter, and the next day it can go out and perform a mission of a utility helicopter. That's some flexibility that doesn't exist right now in the marketplace, and that's something that we think is very interesting that frankly would not have happened but for the synergy between our Missiles and Fire Control organization, the -- our MST organization and obviously, Sikorsky now."

We've already had our first flight of our offering, so we've taken that T-50 with KAI and converted it into T-50A to meet the requirements that the Air Force has outlined, and we're excited about the fact that we've flown it, we're demonstrating it, and we think we have an excellent offering. And the RFP appears to be slipping out. It's slipping out into the December time frame. So we'll -- I think that -- what I understand is that the Air Force wants to revisit what they've outlined as the requirements for that capability, and they will slip the RFP out some, and we stand ready to support that. But in the meantime, we are continuing to roll out our capabilities and showcase that capability. It's a big program. It's about 350 aircraft, so it's an opportunity for us. In our case, there is some discussion around whether or not the Air Force wants to pursue a clean sheet design or an existing design. We believe that with tremendous gap on the training capabilities, the T-38 is -- I don't think it's close to 50 years old or something like that. It's -- they need to replace that aircraft, and the fact that we have a low-risk aircraft that's already flying, that can meet today's requirements, we think we're offering something that would allow the U.S. Air Force to move forward on the program and meet that capability. There are other offerings out there as well that are not clean sheet, and so we'd like to compete, and we think we have a tremendous offering."

So relative to the share count reduction and whether or not that's enough to sort of offset the dilution effects of losing the IS&GS earnings or not. You're right, at the call when we announced the deal back in January, we said that the share buyback was essentially going to be enough to make that sort of neutral between the 2 years. Since that time, our stock has increased. If I look at today, it's up almost 25% over what the number was in January. I think we were trading at around $210 a share the day we announced the deal. So pretty significant increase on our side, which makes it obviously more expensive to buy back the same number of shares as we had expected in the January call. On the other hand, the Leidos stock price has dropped a little bit since that time, so both of those are sort of working against us from a shares perspective that will be taken out as a result of the RMT transaction. So as we sit today, George, even with the $1.8 billion, it's probably difficult to get exactly to neutral, but it gets a lot closer there. We still think the economics of this deal relative to all options that we looked at, an outright sale, a pure spin, this is still the best situation for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders, and we don't have regret on that, notwithstanding the fact that, to your point, we actually may see a little bit of EPS dilution as a result of the stock price movement. I think that's a little bit of a high-class problem that we're experiencing right now, but nonetheless, that is where we are. 
As to the charge we took, we did take an additional charge, $30 million, you're right. This is sort of the command-and-control business that we're looking -- so think of this as sort of a system that controls all sorts of air missile defense capabilities around an entire country, including identifying friend or foes so that you don't have the wrong issues with that air missile defense capability. So linking into a lot of different systems, but we think we have prospects once this system is developed in other places internationally, but we've had some growing pains, obviously with this, and I think as we've gone through the development and early stages of this program, the customer has kind of changed some of what their expectations are, so we are in discussions with the customer right now about sort of closure of this contract. We think where it sits right now, it's pretty well-positioned in terms of the charges we've taken. There is some upside potential to that, depending on where the customer wants to head. There could be some downside, so we're kind of in the middle of that right now, George, and obviously, we'll keep you apprised as we go through future quarters and let you know how we're performing on that contract."

Thanks, David, and I probably wasn't at my clearest when I made that reference in the first quarter. I think I heard feedback as we went around in -- at investor conferences and so forth that I think I stumbled with my answer there quite honestly, so I tried to be clearer this time. Obviously I'm still not being clear, but let me try to be as crystal clear as I can on this thing. So FAS/CAS in 2016, the benefit is about $975 million or so. What I said is I would expect to be between -- if we struck the line in the sand right now, probably $350 million to $400 million lower than the 2016 FAS/CAS benefit in 2017. I mean, to do the math, that kind of translates into $625 million, $600-ish million income number, down considerably from what we were talking about in the first quarter of last year, almost all of that because of the discount rate changing 1,000 basis -- or not 1,000, 100 basis points as I talked about. Importantly, back to Rich's question, it's a noncash item, will not affect our 2017 contributions at all. 
And that relates to your question relative to the $1.8 billion and would we use that to fund -- prefund a pension plan. The answer is we don't have that expectation sitting here today, and I don't think that's what we will do with the money. As I said earlier in the -- to another question, I think the more likely outcome is probably share repurchases at this point in time, and we'll fund the 2018 requirement in 2018. We've already got, quite honestly, a fairly sizable prepayment credit balance in terms of how much we have contributed to ERISA versus what we've collected from our government contracts, and we don't see the point at this time to sort of increasing that level."

One is through what's called an undefinitized contractual action or a UCA. You've heard that term obviously in the past. We don't care frankly how we get the cash. If it comes under a UCA, though, UCAs get funded essentially and allows you to bill against the UCA with progress payments. So we would not recover as much cash under a UCA although we would still get a significant amount of cash under a UCA funding mechanism as we would if we actually definitize the contract because under the LRIP 9 and 10 we would expect to have performance-based payments. And performance-based payments, where we are in the contract today, would actually give us greater cash recovery than with the UCA. I hope that made sense. 
As to impact on margins and so forth, I wouldn't expect one or the other to have any impact whatsoever on the margins we're negotiating. The only sort of economic impact that we're seeing, and we have raised this with the government, is depending on how long this shortfall lasts, and I gave you some numbers relative to the shortfall, we could be -- if we choose to fund -- and again, avoid the disruption of the -- particularly, the supply chain on the program and the international partners on the program, if we chose to fund, we probably would have to get in the commercial paper market bigger than we are, and that's not something we look forward to and that's probably something that we'd have to have a conversation about what's equitable if, in fact, that takes place with the government. So potential for a negative on the commercial paper, but we would expect that there potentially could be some consideration for that if, in fact, that's what happened.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our third quarter results. As today's release details, we continue to move forward financially, operationally and strategically while delivering critical solutions to customers and returning value to stockholders. 
In addition to our discussion of financial results and outlooks, I want to highlight a few operational accomplishments in our business areas and other key events in the quarter, including DoD budget status and the successful disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business.
Looking at the summary financials, our team continued to deliver strong results across the corporation, with third quarter sales, continuing operations profit, earnings per share and cash from operations all exceeding internal plans. We are driving towards achievement of full year 2016 goals, and we are looking forward to another strong year in in 2017, fueled by top line growth in our streamlined
 
[Audio Gap] 
Bruce will provide a detailed review of the financial results, 2016 full year outlook, 2017 preliminary trends outlook and assumptions in his comments later in the call. 
The first area I want to speak to is our cash generation and deployment. This quarter, we achieved over $1.3 billion in cash from operations, bringing September year-to-date cash generation to approximately $4.5 billion. While we have achieved strong year-to-date cash performance, I would note that our fourth quarter outlook contains a higher-than-normal level of significant F-35 cash timing events. Successful closure of these events are dependent on completions of various contractual negotiations before the end of the year. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved 2 key actions in the area of cash deployment. First, the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.82 per share and $7.28 annually. This action represents the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double-digit percentage. Second, share repurchase authority was increased by $2 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion at the end of the third quarter. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make significant cash -- significant future share repurchases. 
In recent actions taken by our board, these will enable us to continue our shareholder-friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. 
Before examining our third quarter results, I wanted to briefly touch on the status of the fiscal year 2017 DoD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution through December 9 that limits expenditures to prior year fiscal levels. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible. While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY '17 year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings and cash flows in 2017 as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years. There are multiple and differing budget scenarios under consideration for the FY '17 budgets. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budget funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DoD-based budget. Reconciliation of the different budget -- DoD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope this is not the case as it is not in the best interest of our nation. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 9. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of FY '17 budget to remove the uncertainty resulting from nonstrategic short-term government funding actions.
Moving to operations. While there were numerous mission success events across the corporation this quarter, I will limit my comments to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. A highlight of the quarter was the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model being declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force and achieving initial operational capability or IOC. This declaration reflects the maturity and performance of the CTOL aircraft and successful achievement of all key criteria to reach IOC readiness. The IOC enables the U.S. Air Force to be the second branch of the military to field combat-ready F-35 aircraft as they join the U.S. Marine Corps with their operational F-35B aircraft in providing unequaled fifth-generation fighters to our nation and allies. With over 70% of the more than 3,000 aircraft production plan for the F-35 being the CTOL variant, achievement of IOC for this aircraft strengthens the foundation for future decades of fighter production for domestic and international customers. 
In addition to the achievement of the IOC milestone, the F-35 also demonstrated the benefit of its unique fusion -- fused sensors in its first live-fire missile intercept event. By leveraging a U.S. Marine Corps F-35 and the U.S. Navy's Aegis Weapon System, the aircraft demonstrated the ability of the F-35 to greatly expand the target identification and acquisition range in its support of naval integrated fire-control missions. The F-35 served as an elevated sensor and detected an over-the-horizon missile threat. It then utilized its advanced data link to send data to an Aegis Weapon System that subsequently engaged and destroyed the target. This fusion of sensors across multiple systems only begins to outline the potential enhanced warfighting capabilities and distributed lethality that F-35 aircraft will enable across our military forces. This capability is embedded in all F-35 variants today and is just one of the revolutionary technologies that this aircraft bring to our nation and allies.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35. Key milestones this past quarter included rollout the first F-35A aircraft for the Japan Air Self Defense Force, marking a major milestone in Japan's enhanced national security defense and strengthening the future of the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Japan continues to reflect a planned procurement of 42 aircraft for their national defense requirements. 
Beyond the activities for Japan, Norway became the first international partner nation to state its intention to participate in a multiyear multinational block buy of the F-35. Norway outlined a request for 12 F-35 fighters in their 2017 budget and remains on track to their stated plan to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for their national defense. 
We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively field this fifth-generation fighter for decades to come.
I'd like to turn to a different topic and provide you a status report on one of the strategic goals we outlined to you 2 years ago. At the time, we challenged ourselves to expand our focus and footprint overseas and established a goal to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to the change in our portfolio of content, resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the disposition of IS&GS, we are on track to exceed that goal later this year as the remaining business areas perform a significantly high proportion of international work banded IS&GS. International work across the corporation is expanding, especially in the areas of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes and tactical missiles. The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world. 
Our proven and cost-effective solutions are securing awards from new customers worldwide. We are seeing demand for our equipment ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle East theaters. This demand helps strengthen growth as our international portfolio is growing at a faster rate than the DoD budget. Higher international work is also providing greater economies of scale that enhances our ability to improve the affordability of platforms and services to both domestic and international customers. 
We are expanding our efforts across all of our business areas to provide our products to international customers. With this focus remaining a key element in our growth strategy for the corporation, we now expect to increase our international sales content to at least 30% of total annual sales in the next few years. I am confident that we have the portfolio, strategy and personnel to achieve this new, higher level as we move forward.
I want to conclude my comments by recognizing one of the key accomplishments this past quarter: the successful completion of our strategic disposition of the IS&GS business to Leidos. Closure of the disposition through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust better positions that business to generate shareholder value and opportunities for employees as they move forward outside our corporation. This RMT transaction generated the highest value creation benefits to our stockholders and allows us to focus even more intensely on our remaining core DoD portfolio. Completion of the transaction enabled retirement of over 9 million shares of our stock through the exchange offers plus receipt of $1.8 billion in cash to our corporation. We are deploying that cash through dividends, share repurchases and debt retirement, and are on track for full deployment of the cash before the end of this year.
I'll close by stating that we have taken significant actions over the past year to reshape our portfolio and strengthen our core defense business. I'm confident this positions us well to grow and deliver long-term value to our stockholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,403600085,1060255,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Our",2349,"Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. 
Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half results, and we are ahead of our plan in all key financial measures through the first 3 quarters of the year. As you are aware, we completed the split-off of the IS&GS business area during the quarter, and both our current and historical results are now stated on a continuing operations basis. 
During the second quarter call, we also identified several other events that we expected to occur in the third quarter that would impact our financial results, and we'll provide an update on these events in the coming charts. And we'll provide our updated 2016 outlook, taking into consideration all of these items in subsequent charts. So we're pleased with our strong results in the quarter and with our outlook for the year in total.
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter with the third quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.5 billion or 15% this year than last year. And similar to the second quarter, the growth was driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of RMS for about $1.2 billion and over $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by higher F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was about $180 million higher than last year with the growth coming primarily from Space Systems as a result of better performance and the book gain associated with the consolidation of AWE that we will discuss in more detail on the next chart. 
Chart 5 highlights the key financial events impacting earnings in the quarter that we previewed during the July call. From a continuing operations perspective, the largest impact was the $127 million book gain associated with our obtaining a controlling interest in AWE that resulted in a $0.34 favorable impact in the quarter and the year. That gain was partially offset by the initial amortization of an intangible asset associated with the gain, which reduced EPS in the quarter by a $0.01 and $0.06 for the year. The intangible amortization will continue on an accelerated basis over the next 8 years. 
Next, we move the FAS/CAS pension adjustment associated with IS&GS and to discontinued operations, and that lowered EPS by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. And we updated our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in both the quarter and the year. We are substantially complete with the purchase accounting for Sikorsky and do not expect significant changes as we close this effort in the fourth quarter. All told, these impacts to continuing operations EPS added $0.27 in the quarter and $0.11 for the year. In discontinued operations, we recognize the book gain of about $1.2 billion associated with the disposition of IS&GS as well as 2016 operating results up until the August disposition date. These 2 items amounted to $4.32 of EPS in the quarter and $4.97 for the year. 
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll see how our earnings per share in the quarter compare with the EPS from 1 year ago. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.61, which was aided by the $0.27 benefit we described in the prior chart. In addition, the third quarter benefited from improved operating performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment, the lower tax rate and lower share count than in the third quarter of 2015.
On Chart 7, you can see our cash from operations this quarter compared to last year. Cash in the quarter was around $1.3 billion, about $200 million lower than the third quarter of 2015 and continues to be impacted by our decision to fund F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 in excess of the amount of government funding. At the end of the quarter, that exposure was $950 million. While we did receive additional funding for LRIP 9 during the quarter, that funding was not sufficient to match the growth in both LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 expenditures in the quarter, resulting in the increased exposure from the second quarter. We remain hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon but have concerns with receiving collections before year-end as we'll discuss when we show our revised outlook for the year in a few charts.
Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders on a year-to-date basis. With just under $4.5 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and about $600 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow so far this year is around $3.8 billion. With $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.3 billion in shares repurchased to date, we have returned $2.8 billion to stockholders or 73% of free cash flow. And in the third quarter, we increased both our dividend rate and share repurchase authority, as Marillyn highlighted in her comments earlier. 
On Chart 9, you can see the significant reduction in our share count over time, from our peak share count of 456 million shares in 2002, we've reduced shares outstanding to 293 million, 36% less than we had at the peak. And adjusting our previously stated goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, for the 9 million of share reductions from the RMT exchange offer, we expect to achieve the restated goal of 291 million shares by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned. 
Chart 10 provides the updated outlook for the year. On the chart, we have 3 columns. The first shows the outlook we provided during the second quarter call. The middle column shows the same outlook adjusted for the removal of IS&GS results, and the third column shows the revised outlook compared with the middle column. We increased our sales outlook above the high end of the previous guidance to $46.5 billion, and this was driven primarily by higher sales expectations for Aeronautics and Space Systems. Segment operating profit was also increased above the high end of the previous guidance, also driven by Aeronautics and Space Systems. We increased earnings per share from continuing operations to around $12.10, reflecting the strong third quarter results. And we are giving 2 views of cash from operations: One, assuming we do collect billings for the F-35 program before year-end; and one assuming those collections slip into 2017. Assuming we do collect F-35 billings, our cash outlook is greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, a $350 million improvement over the restated second quarter outlook, and this improvement reflects strong cash performance at RMS, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control. If the F-35 collections split into 2017, our outlook for 2016 would be greater than or equal to $5 billion. The $700 million difference in the outlooks would be a digital event at year-end. If it slips out of 2016, 2017 will be $700 million higher. If it does not, 2016 will be $700 million higher, but the total cash between the 2 years will not change. And we'll elaborate more on that in a few charts.
Chart 11 shows our prior sales outlook compared with the current outlook by business area. Compared with the midpoint of our previous guidance, we are increasing our sales outlook by $900 million with Space Systems and Aeronautics driving the change. Space Systems increased due to the consolidation of AWE results into our financial statements, while Aeronautics grew due primarily to continued higher-than-expected sales performance on the F-35 program. 
Chart 12 provides the same outlook update for segment operating profit. As with sales, the segment operating profit outlook was driven by increases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. The increase in Aeronautics was driven primarily by the additional F-35 sales volume and improved performance across several programs. The increase in Space Systems was driven by the AWE consolidation gain as well as improved performance in government satellites. 
On Chart 13, we provide our preliminary trends information for 2017. We expect sales to increase around 7% above the 2016 level, with most of the increase coming from Aeronautics' growth driven by F-35 production and sustainment, and Missiles and Fire Control growth driven by higher air missile defense sales. RMS and Space Systems about offset each other next year, with slight growth in RMS being offset by lower sales in Space Systems as the additional AWE volume for a full year in 2017 compared to a partial 2016 is more than offset by lower volume in our government satellite business as well as the absence of any commercial launch activity next year. We expect segment operating margin to range between 10% to 10.5% with the reduction from the 2016 levels driven primarily by a full year of consolidated AWE sales in 2017 without the benefit of the gain in 2016, lower ULA equity earnings due to the mix and volume of launched vehicles expected in 2017 as well as the end of the $40 million annual deferred gain in 2016 and the significant volume increase in F-35 sales at a lower margin rate than the average for the corporation.
Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, again assuming the F-35 collection slide into 2017. We'll provide more color on our longer-term views on cash from operations on the next chart. And we're planning to have at least $2 billion of share repurchases next year, which we expect will further reduce our share count below the 290 million share level. 
Our updated pension outlook assumes a FAS/CAS adjustment of $800 million of income, higher than we discussed during the second quarter call. Interest rates have risen slightly since the last call, and we now see a discount rate of 3.625% rather than the 3.5% we mentioned last quarter. In addition, a new longevity table was published late last week that results in another improvement to the FAS/CAS projection we provided last quarter. 
On the next 2 charts, we provide a longer-term view of both cash from operations and our pension impacts. Beginning with Chart 14 and our longer-term trend for cash from operations. During the third quarter of 2014, we established a goal of generating more than $15 billion of total operating cash for the years 2015 to 2017, significantly higher than prior years as we were expecting what we called a pension funding holiday for that 3-year period. As you can see from the chart, assuming the F-35 collection slip into 2017 and based on our 2-year view of cash for 2016 and 2017, we expect to generate around $15.8 billion over the 3-year time frame, significantly exceeding the 2014 goal. If we look forward to the next 3 years beginning with 2017, we also expect to generate at least $15 billion of total operating cash between 2017 and 2019 with all years at or near $5 billion even after we began to make required pension contributions in both 2018 and 2019. 
On Chart 15, we provide a view of our expectations for both the FAS/CAS adjustment and cash implications of our pension plan over a longer time frame. All of our projections on this chart assume an 8% return on assets every year and a constant discount rate of 3.625%. As most of you know, we have a significant pre-funding balance that represents the difference between our pension contributions as required by ERISA and the recovery of those contributions via our cash billings to the government.
At the end of 2016, we expect that pre-fund credit balance to be around $7 billion, and we expect to recover a sizable portion of that $7 billion through the year 2025, which means that our CAS recoveries should exceed required pension contributions in all years through 2025, providing a cash tailwind even during years with required contributions. And as many of you also recall, our pension plan was modified in 2014 in a 2-step process that results in the plan becoming fully frozen at the end of 2019. The first step of the plan modification began in 2016 with the freeze to the salary levels used to calculate pension benefits. This means that between 2017 and 2019, our FAS expense will decrease while our CAS expense increases to recognize the recovery of the pre-fund balance. At the end of 2019, we have the second step of our plan modification, a freezing of the years of service used to calculate pension benefits. And at this point, the plan becomes fully frozen. Beginning in 2020, we will no longer have service accruals for our salaried workforce, and this creates a number of changes to our FAS/CAS adjustment because of the full freeze. We will no longer recognize service cost for the frozen plan, and the amortization period for previous actuarial losses or gains will be extended from roughly 9 years to about 18 years in length. The combination of these changes will likely result in FAS income rather than FAS expense beginning in 2020 as our expected FAS asset returns will exceed the cost elements in our FAS calculation. This means we would expect to have considerable FAS/CAS adjustment income growth between 2017 to 2019 and then see significantly higher FAS/CAS adjustment income beginning in 2020 going forward for the foreseeable future based on current assumptions. 
That leads us to our summary on Chart 16. We had a strong operational and financial -- we had strong operational and financial performance in the quarter and expect to finish the year in a similar fashion. We completed the IS&GS RMT transaction in a manner that was beneficial to the IS&GS business and Lockheed Martin stockholders. The strategic actions we've taken over the past year have strengthened our portfolio and will enable us for future growth. And we have long-term trends and cash from operations and pension impacts that position us to continue to deliver value to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Andrea?"

I think the latter part of your question was were there risk to the margins. And you should think of at least the near-term margins are really impacted by contracts that were negotiated much prior to LRIPs 9 and 10. So especially 2016 and 2017 has very little, if anything, to do with the margin performance in LRIP 9 and 10. The latter years, obviously, are much greater impacted. We're still looking to have margins on the F-35 program eventually get to mirror or mimic what we've seen in the similar life cycle of the F-16 programs and C-130 programs, and that's still our objective as we sit here today."

I think you're pretty close to being right. So I think you should think of the AWE, which I'm not sure if it's organic or inorganic, by the way, but you should think of AWE as contributing about roughly $400 million in sales this year, probably growing to a little over $1 billion, $1.1 billion next year, so maybe $700 million of change, so that's probably a little less than 2%. So we would think that growth organically, as you described it, from year-over-year is probably in the high 4s, maybe a little bit around 5% or so next year. Going forward for the next 3 years or so, we still believe and we kind of talked about in the second quarter call that we think we have growth ranging from about 3% to 5% in the outyears. We still feel good about that. Although it's probably not as steady over those years as you might think, so we have the sort of bigger uptick that we're expecting in 2017, a lot of that driven by the F-35 program. We see additional growth in 2018 also by F-35, but there's a countervailing issue happening because we have the end of the F-16 production line and the end of C-5 deliveries, both of which occurred in 2018. So while we still see growth, organic growth in '18, it will be a little bit diminished because of those 2 events but still better than we've seen for the last few years. And then, frankly, as we sit here today and look at the longer term, 2019 is a higher growth rate than 2018, in part because of the absence of those 2 events."

So you're right. And I think from conversations that we've had at conferences and with investors as I've toured through, there was a lot of misunderstanding perhaps relative to our ability to continue to generate cash flow from operations when we started having pension contributions. So we wanted to tee up that we do think we're going to continue to have strong cash from operations, which is the reason why we kind of put the new goal essentially the same as the old goal for a 3-year period with a common 2017 in both of those 3-year goals. The amount of pension contributions, we have 0 in '17 for all intents and purposes. We had some sort of minor contributions relative to the Sikorsky collective bargaining pension plan, but for all intents and purposes, that's pretty minimal. In 2018 and 2019, it's still a little fluid at this point in time, but you should think of both of those years probably ranging between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of pension contributions. So we are able to essentially mimic what we did with the pension funding holiday because we do expect to have sort of organic, if I could use that term, operational cash growth, and most of that comes from the F-35 program going forward. The Sikorsky business, which we described as sort of treading water for a number of years from a cash flow perspective and then as we finished a lot of the development programs and a couple of the loss programs, frankly, that we have within Sikorsky, we expect to see a return to cash generation. And then the last one is the international growth that we talked about, that Marillyn talked about earlier. So those 3 elements have then sort of everyone else hold in constant is contributing vitally towards that level. And then I'll remind you, maybe -- I know you know this, Rich, but while we do make those pension contributions and that's a hit to operating cash, they're also tax-deductible, so that's a 35% offset to what we see there as well."

You should think that most of the -- in fact, just the overwhelming majority of the growth in the international business going forward as being FMS or for military sales in nature as opposed to direct commercial sales in nature. And frankly, most of that growth when you think about problems like the F-35 and the [indiscernible] missile and the FAD air missile defense system, most of those are being negotiated -- even though they're FMS, most of them are being negotiated concurrently with the U.S. government's needs, so I would not expect them to see -- I would not expect to see huge benefits, margin-wise, from the growth we're seeing in international business. Some of that may materialize. We're starting to see sort of pockets of direct commercial sales within that 30%. And to the extent that, that happens, that's usually at a high margin and FMS but not hugely accretive would be my overall take."

I think we'll see countries that will look at buying that greater capability. On FAD, it's in the UAE today, of course, and there's a strong pull for FAD in the Middle East, cutter and potentially Saudi and others will be looking at that going forward. On Aegis, Aegis we just went live Korea and Japan there adding it to their shifts, and we'll have other countries I think moving along in that regard. We set up our Aegis Azure in Romania, and we see an opportunity in Poland. And then from a competition standpoint, the Medium Extended Air Defense System now that Germany has made our selection, we expect other NATO countries to be looking at MEADS and maybe some Middle East countries looking at MEADS as a potential for their capability within the 360-degree capability and really the next generation beyond Patriot system as the new system. So Poland is still looking at MEADS, for example, and we've had some interest from some Middle East countries on MEADS. And then the ground-based strategic trend is another opportunity for us in growth in missile defense in the U.S. and so not just in the international marketplace, we continue to see growth on the domestic market for missile defense capability. So hopefully, that answers your question. I think over time, the defensive systems that countries need, we expect will continue to put in place. The threats are not diminishing, they're increasing and so the defensive systems you can provide and what we hear from countries around the world that they want, whether it's Japan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or others as I travel around the world, that is a top priority for these countries."

It's not finalized by any stretch of imagination. And none of the numbers that I talked about previously in terms of the growth going forward assume the Bahraini aircraft in the F-16 lines. So right now, it's not in their longer-term for the F-16 as they sort of teed up to Noah's question I think it was relative to the growth going forward. Right now, the F-16 line comes to an end at the end of -- in the middle of 2018 or thereabouts if we weren't to get the Bahrain order, that would extend it probably another year or so. But you should think that the F-16 program is not going away at all. In fact, if we look at 2017 -- I said '18 I think the line comes to end in 2017. I spoke a year off there. I think we have 6 aircraft deliveries in 2017. That's the wrap-up of the program from a build cycle versus 12 this year, and yet the sales the F-16 program are higher next year than they are this year. And in part, that's because we have you should think of it of 3 large international upgrade programs going on concurrently or pretty much concurrently. We've got the Singaporean, the Taiwanese and a soon-to-be South Korean upgrade of their existing F-16 aircraft, which is actually turns out more than offsetting the production quantity aircraft drop-off next year, so hopefully a little more color there. FAD cutter, we have hoped to close that this year looking towards the end of this calendar year. That's in all likelihood not going to happen. We have it planned and expect to close that in 2017."

So let's see, on the purchase accounting, Sam, I'd say that's a little bit of just sort of housekeeping stuff, nothing hugely dramatic that occurred there as some of these sorts of adjustments for things like inventory and so forth move around a little bit in part because of the timing of some of the deliveries associated with that inventory and just a better understanding of the business in total. All of the adjustments are required to be done 1 year after the purchase date, which I believe is November 6, so all those are required to be finalized in the fourth quarter. The one benefit that you should see going forward is we are going to have a lightening up, if you will, of the total conforming accounting and purchase accounting adjustments on Sikorsky of about -- I think about $150 million a year or so going forward. So from '16 to '17, that was what was always in the plan. The purchase accounting adjustments that we see happening this year really don't impact that much. You just talked about opportunities relative to the bottoming out in the military -- I'm sorry, in the commercial marketplace and so forth. We're seeing opportunities pop up. I think Marillyn hit these pretty well in terms of the Polish Blackhawk deal, which could be actually built, hand delivered out of Poland from our facility there is an interesting opportunity. We have other international opportunities, although they're coming in dribs and drabs, not huge orders, but they're still helping to sort of fill the backlog. As far as the commercial help market, we don't expect to see that change. In fact, our projections and what we gave in the 7% increase next year essentially says we're flat to maybe a few less than in 2016. And we're hopeful and the numbers with plans suggest that there's a slight uptick in 2018 but nothing huge. So we think this is a fairly slow recovery and not a spike by any stretch of imagination, but nothing between 2016 and 2017."

I think the wildcard here is when I said there I didn't expect to have the significant amount of growth on the F-35 program, particularly the sustainment piece of the F-35 program going from 2016 to 2017. I mean it's just amazing the growth that we are seeing on the sustainment program compared to what we previously thought, at least what I previously thought and what I was basing that margin comment on. So the margin of Arrow will likely be a little bit lighter in 2017 than it was in 2016. And most of that, but maybe not all of that, is driven by the F-35 significant ramp up and again what I will always call the margin dilutive algebraic effect of just a lower margin program going faster than the rest of the business area, and that has dilutive effect on the margins. But as we look forward in the 2018 and I did tee up the C-5 and the F-16, again, F-16 is not changing total sales volume all that much, although the aircraft boundaries are coming down. C-5 is actually again a little bit dilutive to the overall margin, but because of the F-35 growth, it's occurring again between '18 and '17. I think the margins kind of stay fairly constant probably as we look at this time for 2017 and 2018."

Can you comment on what's causing that and that's what will be in the fourth quarter and on that score, if I just look at your guidance, it implies over $5 billion of revenues in Aeronautics in the fourth quarter, which is usually a strong quarter, but the step-up is much more than what you've seen in the past, so we just discuss that. And then last, if I look at this $300 million of higher F-35 sales you're calling out, profit only up $25 million, so 8.3% implied margin. That's a little lower than we've seen in the past. So maybe if you could comment on that."

So F-35 deliveries, I should remind you this is a POC cost-to-cost contract, so the revenue is not impacted by deliveries, but you did make the right observation, George. The deliveries were light -- lighter than the third quarter than we'd otherwise suggest, and this is primarily because and then a you guys severed about this but we have these insulation tubes that affected a number of our aircraft in the field as well as the aircraft being produced. And while we have the fix for that issue in place, think of this as a supplier-driven item that we have sort of an out-of-spec delivery that was installed in the aircraft. And as we go through and fix those for the aircraft in the field, we're also going back and fixing the aircraft that are affected with those lines in production, and that is going to cause us to end up little lighter in F-35 deliveries this year than what we previously have said. We think we know the solution for that, as I said. We think the recover such that by the end of 2017, we're sort of back on contractual schedule, hopefully sooner than the end of 2017, but that's the expectation right now. The other thing we talked about was F-35 being greater than $5 billion in the quarter or Aeronautics being greater than $5 billion in the quarter. That is -- that will be the highest quarter, I think, in the history of Aeronautics, but that's sort of tracking, George, to what we expect the annual run rate to look like in 2017. Years ago, we had talked about the Aeronautics business area being about a $20 billion per year revenue business in 2015. It turns out we were close, but that's likely going to happen now in 2017 as opposed to 2015. So that's tracking right with our expectations. And then the last question on the $300 million in sales and the risk retirements, and I think you said 8-point something percent profit, that's sort of in line with what we've done. We've had quarters previous in this year that were higher, but that's because we had some of the risk retirements that we're talking to Howard about earlier that occurred in previous quarters. So when we have those risk retirements, we kind of get the spike in the margin. We just didn't have as many this quarter so the run rate you're seeing there is about the run rate without risk retirements in the quarter."

So first comment, Rob, you did hear it right, that is what we said, and I think you got the math to all that correct. And honestly, that's an interesting question because, actually, the CAS recover or the pension recovery associated with CAS is diminishing going forward. So again, we talked about '15 to '17 having a pension holiday. That means we did -- we're not going to make pension contribution, so significant level of sort of pension recovery because of that. Going forward, this is what I was trying to convey in my remarks, while we have pension contributions at the level that you just described the CAS recovery is also increasing pretty significantly and stays fairly high throughout this entire time frame. And that's again, essentially -- not essentially, but a good chunk of that is recovering that $7 billion of sort of pre-fund credit that we have at the end of this year. So that has to sort of come back at some point in the CAS billings that we have in the government. That's what sustains us over that time. Even though the net cash for pension is coming down, the offset is due to operational cash going up."

And that's, again, back to Rob's question, that's one thing that's driving the cash recovery over that period of time. Sikorsky is doing better than we had expected, at least to the first 3 quarters of this year. I think we started off with probably a little more conservative view of Sikorsky, just a little bit of not knowing the business as well as I think we do now. And so we've seen some performance improvements or some risk retirements, I should say, in the third quarter that translated to better performance than we were seeing in the first 2 quarters of the year. I think you also talked about the changes in intangible. I might have misspoken, I think I was talking about conforming accounting and intangible amortization all rolled up into one, and there definitely are some reductions in some of the conforming accounting adjustments as well as I think one of the things I teed up in the January call was there was about $30 million or $40 million of sort of severance cost left over in 2016 from a severance action that was taken in the middle of January -- middle of 2015 that does not repeat itself in 2017. That, along with sort of lower integration costs in 2017 compared to 2016, is what's driving the improvements that I talked about."

The performance, you described as performance, I would characterize as performance, just the growth in sustainment activity that we see and why the surprise or why do they seem like a surprise. I think, to a certain extent, this is a little bit I won't say out of our control entirely, but it is dependent upon when the government establishes sort of the base setups for the induction of F-35 aircraft and what level of support those bases need in order to be ready to take on operational F-35 aircraft. And I'll say we were probably a little conservative or maybe a lot of conservative in our forecast as far as thinking that the level -- if you just think of all the things that have to be at a base day 1 when you start delivering aircraft dividend base, all the alternate vision equipments, all the support equipment and things to pull aircraft around, ladders to get on there, you could just get on all the stuff that has to go into a base and I'll say we are probably pretty light on that forecast until we had some of those bases under our belt, and now we have some of those bases under our belt and we have a better understanding of what sort of the average needs are of the aircraft going forward. And so that's what we're projecting going forward, and I think we've got a much better handle on that going forward than we have in the past. It's all good news as far as I'm concerned. Looking forward, you asked about the margin trajectory. I wouldn't expect to see huge swings in margin associated with sustainment. We typically get margins on sustainment that are kind of negotiated concurrently with the aircraft program that kind of negotiated at about same levels of profitability, so I wouldn't expect to see a swing either way because of production or sustainment. It might remind you that, over time, the development program, the SED contract is winding down over time. And again, that will end eventually, unless we continue to put development efforts on there, but that's going down next year. That's one of the things helping to mitigate some of the Aeronautics dilution from the F-35 program."

In addition to our discussion of financial results and outlooks, I want to highlight a few operational accomplishments in our business areas and other key events in the quarter, including DoD budget status and the successful disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business.
Looking at the summary financials, our team continued to deliver strong results across the corporation, with third quarter sales, continuing operations profit, earnings per share and cash from operations all exceeding internal plans. We are driving towards achievement of full year 2016 goals, and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2017, fueled by top line growth in our streamlined
 
[Audio Gap] 
Bruce will provide a detailed review of the financial results, 2016 full year outlook, 2017 preliminary trends outlook and assumptions in his comments later in the call. 
The first area I want to speak to is our cash generation and deployment. This quarter, we achieved over $1.3 billion in cash from operations, bringing September year-to-date cash generation to approximately $4.5 billion. While we have achieved strong year-to-date cash performance, I would note that our fourth quarter outlook contains a higher-than-normal level of significant F-35 cash timing events. Successful closure of these events are dependent on completions of various contractual negotiations before the end of the year. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved 2 key actions in the area of cash deployment. First, the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.82 per share and $7.28 annually. This action represents the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double-digit percentage. Second, share repurchase authority was increased by $2 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion at the end of the third quarter. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make significant cash -- significant future share repurchases. 
In recent actions taken by our board, these will enable us to continue our shareholder-friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. 
Before examining our third quarter results, I wanted to briefly touch on the status of the fiscal year 2017 DoD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution through December 9 that limits expenditures to prior year fiscal levels. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible. While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY '17 year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings and cash flows in 2017 as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years. There are multiple and differing budget scenarios under consideration for the FY '17 budgets. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budget funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DoD-based budget. Reconciliation of the different budget -- DoD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope this is not the case as it is not in the best interest of our nation. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 9. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of FY '17 budget to remove the uncertainty resulting from nonstrategic short-term government funding actions.
Moving to operations. While there were numerous mission success events across the corporation this quarter, I will limit my comments to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. A highlight of the quarter was the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model being declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force and achieving Initial Operational Capability or IOC. This declaration reflects the maturity and performance of the CTOL aircraft and successful achievement of all key criteria to reach IOC readiness. The IOC enables the U.S. Air Force to be the second branch of the military to field combat-ready F-35 aircraft as they join the U.S. Marine Corps with their operational F-35B aircraft in providing unequaled fifth-generation fighters to our nation and allies. With over 70% of the more than 3,000 aircraft production plan for the F-35 being the CTOL variant, achievement of IOC for this aircraft strengthens the foundation for future decades of fighter production for domestic and international customers. 
In addition to the achievement of the IOC milestone, the F-35 also demonstrated the benefit of its unique fusion -- fused sensors in its first live-fire missile intercept event. By leveraging a U.S. Marine Corps F-35 and the U.S. Navy's Aegis Weapon System, the aircraft demonstrated the ability of the F-35 to greatly expand the target identification and acquisition range in its support of naval integrated fire-control missions. The F-35 served as an elevated sensor and detected an over-the-horizon missile threat. It then utilized its advanced data link to send data to an Aegis Weapon System that subsequently engaged and destroyed the target. This fusion of sensors across multiple systems only begins to outline the potential enhanced warfighting capabilities and distributed lethality that F-35 aircraft will enable across our military forces. This capability is embedded in all F-35 variants today and is just one of the revolutionary technologies that this aircraft bring to our nation and allies.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35. Key milestones this past quarter included rollout the first F-35A aircraft for the Japan Air Self Defense Force, marking a major milestone in Japan's enhanced national security defense and strengthening the future of the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Japan continues to reflect a planned procurement of 42 aircraft for their national defense requirements. 
Beyond the activities for Japan, Norway became the first international partner nation to state its intention to participate in a multiyear multinational block buy of the F-35. Norway outlined a request for 12 F-35 fighters in their 2017 budget and remains on track to their stated plan to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for their national defense. 
We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively field this fifth-generation fighter for decades to come.
I'd like to turn to a different topic and provide you a status report on one of the strategic goals we outlined to you 2 years ago. At the time, we challenged ourselves to expand our focus and footprint overseas and established a goal to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to the change in our portfolio of content, resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the disposition of IS&GS, we are on track to exceed that goal later this year as the remaining business areas perform a significantly high proportion of international work banded IS&GS. International work across the corporation is expanding, especially in the areas of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes and tactical missiles. The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world. 
Our proven and cost-effective solutions are securing awards from new customers worldwide. We are seeing demand for our equipment ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle East theaters. This demand helps strengthen growth as our international portfolio is growing at a faster rate than the DoD budget. Higher international work is also providing greater economies of scale that enhances our ability to improve the affordability of platforms and services to both domestic and international customers. 
We are expanding our efforts across all of our business areas to provide our products to international customers. With this focus remaining a key element in our growth strategy for the corporation, we now expect to increase our international sales content to at least 30% of total annual sales in the next few years. I am confident that we have the portfolio, strategy and personnel to achieve this new, higher level as we move forward.
I want to conclude my comments by recognizing one of the key accomplishments this past quarter: the successful completion of our strategic disposition of the IS&GS business to Leidos. Closure of the disposition through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust better positions that business to generate shareholder value and opportunities for employees as they move forward outside our corporation. This RMT transaction generated the highest value creation benefits to our stockholders and allows us to focus even more intensely on our remaining core DoD portfolio. Completion of the transaction enabled retirement of over 9 million shares of our stock through the exchange offers plus receipt of $1.8 billion in cash to our corporation. We are deploying that cash through dividends, share repurchases and debt retirement, and are on track for full deployment of the cash before the end of this year.
I'll close by stating that we have taken significant actions over the past year to reshape our portfolio and strengthen our core defense business. I'm confident this positions us well to grow and deliver long-term value to our stockholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."

As you are aware, we completed the split-off of the IS&GS business area during the quarter, and both our current and historical results are now stated on a continuing operations basis. 
During the second quarter call, we also identified several other events that we expected to occur in the third quarter that would impact our financial results, and we'll provide an update on these events in the coming charts. And we'll provide our updated 2016 outlook, taking into consideration all of these items in subsequent charts. So we're pleased with our strong results in the quarter and with our outlook for the year in total.
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter with the third quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.5 billion or 15% this year than last year. And similar to the second quarter, the growth was driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of RMS for about $1.2 billion and over $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by higher F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was about $180 million higher than last year with the growth coming primarily from Space Systems as a result of better performance and the book gain associated with the consolidation of AWE that we will discuss in more detail on the next chart. 
Chart 5 highlights the key financial events impacting earnings in the quarter that we previewed during the July call. From a continuing operations perspective, the largest impact was the $127 million book gain associated with our obtaining a controlling interest in AWE that resulted in a $0.34 favorable impact in the quarter and the year. That gain was partially offset by the initial amortization of an intangible asset associated with the gain, which reduced EPS in the quarter by a $0.01 and $0.06 for the year. The intangible amortization will continue on an accelerated basis over the next 8 years. 
Next, we move the FAS/CAS pension adjustment associated with IS&GS and to discontinued operations, and that lowered EPS by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. And we updated our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in both the quarter and the year. We are substantially complete with the purchase accounting for Sikorsky and do not expect significant changes as we close this effort in the fourth quarter. All told, these impacts to continuing operations EPS added $0.27 in the quarter and $0.11 for the year. In discontinued operations, we recognize the book gain of about $1.2 billion associated with the disposition of IS&GS as well as 2016 operating results up until the August disposition date. These 2 items amounted to $4.32 of EPS in the quarter and $4.97 for the year. 
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll see how our earnings per share in the quarter compare with the EPS from 1 year ago. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.61, which was aided by the $0.27 benefit we described in the prior chart. In addition, the third quarter benefited from improved operating performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment, the lower tax rate and lower share count than in the third quarter of 2015.
On Chart 7, you can see our cash from operations this quarter compared to last year. Cash in the quarter was around $1.3 billion, about $200 million lower than the third quarter of 2015 and continues to be impacted by our decision to fund F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 in excess of the amount of government funding. At the end of the quarter, that exposure was $950 million. While we did receive additional funding for LRIP 9 during the quarter, that funding was not sufficient to match the growth in both LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 expenditures in the quarter, resulting in the increased exposure from the second quarter. We remain hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon but have concerns with receiving collections before year-end as we'll discuss when we show our revised outlook for the year in a few charts.
Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders on a year-to-date basis. With just under $4.5 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and about $600 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow so far this year is around $3.8 billion. With $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.3 billion in shares repurchased to date, we have returned $2.8 billion to stockholders or 73% of free cash flow. And in the third quarter, we increased both our dividend rate and share repurchase authority, as Marillyn highlighted in her comments earlier. 
On Chart 9, you can see the significant reduction in our share count over time, from our peak share count of 456 million shares in 2002, we've reduced shares outstanding to 293 million, 36% less than we had at the peak. And adjusting our previously stated goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, for the 9 million of share reductions from the RMT exchange offer, we expect to achieve the restated goal of 291 million shares by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned. 
Chart 10 provides the updated outlook for the year. On the chart, we have 3 columns. The first shows the outlook we provided during the second quarter call. The middle column shows the same outlook adjusted for the removal of IS&GS results, and the third column shows the revised outlook compared with the middle column. We increased our sales outlook above the high end of the previous guidance to $46.5 billion, and this was driven primarily by higher sales expectations for Aeronautics and Space Systems. Segment operating profit was also increased above the high end of the previous guidance, also driven by Aeronautics and Space Systems. We increased earnings per share from continuing operations to around $12.10, reflecting the strong third quarter results. And we are giving 2 views of cash from operations: One, assuming we do collect billings for the F-35 program before year-end; and one assuming those collections slip into 2017. Assuming we do collect F-35 billings, our cash outlook is greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, a $350 million improvement over the restated second quarter outlook, and this improvement reflects strong cash performance at RMS, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control. If the F-35 collections split into 2017, our outlook for 2016 would be greater than or equal to $5 billion. The $700 million difference in the outlooks would be a digital event at year-end. If it slips out of 2016, 2017 will be $700 million higher. If it does not, 2016 will be $700 million higher, but the total cash between the 2 years will not change. And we'll elaborate more on that in a few charts.
Chart 11 shows our prior sales outlook compared with the current outlook by business area. Compared with the midpoint of our previous guidance, we are increasing our sales outlook by $900 million with Space Systems and Aeronautics driving the change. Space Systems increased due to the consolidation of AWE results into our financial statements, while Aeronautics grew due primarily to continued higher-than-expected sales performance on the F-35 program. 
Chart 12 provides the same outlook update for segment operating profit. As with sales, the segment operating profit outlook was driven by increases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. The increase in Aeronautics was driven primarily by the additional F-35 sales volume and improved performance across several programs. The increase in Space Systems was driven by the AWE consolidation gain as well as improved performance in government satellites. 
On Chart 13, we provide our preliminary trends information for 2017. We expect sales to increase around 7% above the 2016 level, with most of the increase coming from Aeronautics' growth driven by F-35 production and sustainment, and Missiles and Fire Control growth driven by higher air missile defense sales. RMS and Space Systems about offset each other next year, with slight growth in RMS being offset by lower sales in Space Systems as the additional AWE volume for a full year in 2017 compared to a partial 2016 is more than offset by lower volume in our government satellite business as well as the absence of any commercial launch activity next year. We expect segment operating margin to range between 10% to 10.5% with the reduction from the 2016 levels driven primarily by a full year of consolidated AWE sales in 2017 without the benefit of the gain in 2016, lower ULA equity earnings due to the mix and volume of launched vehicles expected in 2017 as well as the end of the $40 million annual deferred gain in 2016 and the significant volume increase in F-35 sales at a lower margin rate than the average for the corporation.
Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, again assuming the F-35 collection slide into 2017. We'll provide more color on our longer-term views on cash from operations on the next chart. And we're planning to have at least $2 billion of share repurchases next year, which we expect will further reduce our share count below the 290 million share level. 
Our updated pension outlook assumes a FAS/CAS adjustment of $800 million of income, higher than we discussed during the second quarter call. Interest rates have risen slightly since the last call, and we now see a discount rate of 3.625% rather than the 3.5% we mentioned last quarter. In addition, a new longevity table was published late last week that results in another improvement to the FAS/CAS projection we provided last quarter. 
On the next 2 charts, we provide a longer-term view of both cash from operations and our pension impacts. Beginning with Chart 14 and our longer-term trend for cash from operations. During the third quarter of 2014, we established a goal of generating more than $15 billion of total operating cash for the years 2015 to 2017, significantly higher than prior years as we were expecting what we called a pension funding holiday for that 3-year period. As you can see from the chart, assuming the F-35 collection slip into 2017 and based on our 2-year view of cash for 2016 and 2017, we expect to generate around $15.8 billion over the 3-year time frame, significantly exceeding the 2014 goal. If we look forward to the next 3 years beginning with 2017, we also expect to generate at least $15 billion of total operating cash between 2017 and 2019 with all years at or near $5 billion even after we began to make required pension contributions in both 2018 and 2019. 
On Chart 15, we provide a view of our expectations for both the FAS/CAS adjustment and cash implications of our pension plan over a longer time frame. All of our projections on this chart assume an 8% return on assets every year and a constant discount rate of 3.625%. As most of you know, we have a significant pre-funding balance that represents the difference between our pension contributions as required by ERISA and the recovery of those contributions via our cash billings to the government.
At the end of 2016, we expect that pre-fund credit balance to be around $7 billion, and we expect to recover a sizable portion of that $7 billion through the year 2025, which means that our CAS recoveries should exceed required pension contributions in all years through 2025, providing a cash tailwind even during years with required contributions. And as many of you also recall, our pension plan was modified in 2014 in a 2-step process that results in the plan becoming fully frozen at the end of 2019. The first step of the plan modification began in 2016 with the freeze to the salary levels used to calculate pension benefits. This means that between 2017 and 2019, our FAS expense will decrease while our CAS expense increases to recognize the recovery of the pre-fund balance. At the end of 2019, we have the second step of our plan modification, a freezing of the years of service used to calculate pension benefits. And at this point, the plan becomes fully frozen. Beginning in 2020, we will no longer have service accruals for our salaried workforce, and this creates a number of changes to our FAS/CAS adjustment because of the full freeze. We will no longer recognize service cost for the frozen plan, and the amortization period for previous actuarial losses or gains will be extended from roughly 9 years to about 18 years in length. The combination of these changes will likely result in FAS income rather than FAS expense beginning in 2020 as our expected FAS asset returns will exceed the cost elements in our FAS calculation. This means we would expect to have considerable FAS/CAS adjustment income growth between 2017 to 2019 and then see significantly higher FAS/CAS adjustment income beginning in 2020 going forward for the foreseeable future based on current assumptions. 
That leads us to our summary on Chart 16. We had a strong operational and financial -- we had strong operational and financial performance in the quarter and expect to finish the year in a similar fashion. We completed the IS&GS RMT transaction in a manner that was beneficial to the IS&GS business and Lockheed Martin stockholders. The strategic actions we've taken over the past year have strengthened our portfolio and will enable us for future growth. And we have long-term trends and cash from operations and pension impacts that position us to continue to deliver value to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Andrea?"

I think the latter part of your question was were there risk to the margins. And you should think of at least the near-term margins are really impacted by contracts that were negotiated much prior to LRIPs 9 and 10. So especially 2016 and 2017 has very little, if anything, to do with the margin performance in LRIP 9 and 10. The latter years, obviously, are much greater impacted. We're still looking to have margins on the F-35 program eventually get to mirror or mimic what we've seen in the similar life cycle of the F-16 programs and C-130 programs, and that's still our objective as we sit here today."

We still have some remaining options eligible to be exercised, and those options are just proving to be a lot stickier in the past few years than they have been in the years previously. So we're getting some benefit from where we had planned levels of option exercise just coming in lighter than expected. You talked about the $1.8 billion on the Leidos special cash payment, so we've spent most of that through the first 3 quarters. I want to say it's around $400-some-odd million. It's -- I know it's a little less than that as we sit here today. We made the debt retirement of about $0.5 billion in the month of September. And a pretty good chunk of it has gone towards share repurchases and dividends, including the third quarter dividend that we just made.

So I think you're pretty close to being right. So I think you should think of the AWE, which I'm not sure if it's organic or inorganic, by the way, but you should think of AWE as contributing about roughly $400 million in sales this year, probably growing to a little over $1 billion, $1.1 billion next year, so maybe $700 million of change, so that's probably a little less than 2%. So we would think that growth organically, as you described it, from year-over-year is probably in the high 4s, maybe a little bit around 5% or so next year. Going forward for the next 3 years or so, we still believe, we kind of talked about in the second quarter call that we think we have growth ranging from about 3% to 5% in the outyears. We still feel good about that. Although it's probably not as steady over those years as you might think, so we have the sort of a bigger uptick that we're expecting in 2017, a lot of that driven by the F-35 program. We see additional growth in 2018 also by F-35, but there's a countervailing issue happening because we have the end of the F-16 production line and the end of C-5 deliveries, both of which occur in 2018. So while we still see growth, organic growth in '18, it will be a little bit diminished because of those 2 events but still better than we've seen for the last few years. And then, frankly, as we sit here today and look at the longer term, 2019 is a higher growth rate than 2018, in part because of the absence of those 2 events."

So you're right. And I think just from conversations that we've had at conferences and with investors as I've toured through Bethesda, there was a lot of misunderstanding perhaps relative to our ability to continue to generate cash flow from operations when we started having pension contributions. So we wanted to tee up that we do think we're going to continue to have strong cash from operations, which is the reason why we came up a new goal essentially the same as the old goal for a 3-year period with a common 2017 in both of those 3-year goals. The amount of pension contributions, we have 0 in '17 for all intents and purposes. We have some sort of minor contributions relative to the Sikorsky collective bargaining pension plan, but for all intents and purposes, that's pretty minimal. In 2018 and 2019, it's still a little fluid at this point in time, but you should think of both of those years probably ranging between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of pension contributions. So we are able to essentially mimic what we did with the pension funding holiday because we do expect to have sort of organic, if I could use that term, operational cash growth, and most of that comes from the F-35 program going forward. The Sikorsky business, which we described as sort of treading water for a number of years from a cash flow perspective and then as we finish a lot of the development programs and a couple of the loss programs, frankly, that we have within Sikorsky, we expect to see a return to cash generation. And then the last one is the international growth that we talked about, that Marillyn talked about earlier. So those 3 elements have then sort of everyone else hold in constant is contributing mightily towards that level. And then I'll remind you, maybe -- I know you know this, Rich, but while we do make those pension contributions and that's a hit to operating cash, they're also tax deductible, so that's a 35% offset to what we see there as well."

So we got a lot of already booked business that will come in towards those international sales. And so I think our portfolio is really well positioned for growth.

Jason, I'll take the first one on you described as international revenue stream, and I think the question was whether that was margin accretive or not. You should think that most of the -- in fact, just the overwhelming majority of the growth in the international business going forward as being FMS or for military sales in nature as opposed to direct commercial sales in nature. And frankly, most of that growth when you think about on programs like the F-35 and the PAC-3 missile and the THAAD air missile defense system, most of those are being negotiated -- even though they're FMS, most of them are being negotiated concurrently with the U.S. government's needs, so I would not expect them to see -- I would not expect to see huge benefits, margin-wise, from the growth we're seeing in international business. Some of that may materialize. We're starting to see sort of pockets of direct commercial sales within that 30%. And to the extent that, that happens, that's usually at a high margin than the FMS, but not hugely accretive would be my overall take."

I mean, from a PAC-3 standpoint, we do partner with Raytheon on the Patriot systems, so we continue to sell PAC-3s around the world. And we just declared our initial operating capability for the PAC-3 MSE, the Missile Segment Enhancement, which has extended range and greater capabilities. So we're going to have a continued demand for the PAC-3 MSE. I think we'll see countries that will look at buying that greater capability. On THAAD, as we -- it's in the UAE today, of course, and there's a strong pull for THAAD in the Middle East, Qatar and potentially Saudi and others will be looking at that going forward. On Aegis, Aegis we just -- with the Korea and Japan. They're adding it to their ships, and we'll have other countries, I think, moving along in that regard. Aegis Ashore, we've set up our Aegis Ashore in Romania, and we see an opportunity in Poland. And then from a competition standpoint, MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, now that Germany has made their selection, we expect other NATO countries to be looking at MEADS and maybe some Middle East countries looking at MEADS as a potential for their capability with its 360-degree capability and really the next generation beyond the Patriot system as the new system. So Poland is still looking at MEADS, for example, and we've had some interest from some Middle East countries on MEADS. And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent is another opportunity for us on growth in missile defense in the U.S. and so not just in the international marketplace, we continue to see growth on the domestic market for our missile defense capabilities. So hopefully, that answers your question. I think over time, the defensive systems that countries need, we expect will continue to put in place. The threats are not diminishing, they're increasing. And so the defensive systems that we can provide are what we hear from countries around the world that they want, whether it's Japan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or others as I travel around the world, that is a top priority for these countries."

It's not finalized by any stretch of imagination. And none of the numbers that I talked about previously in terms of the growth going forward assume the Bahraini aircraft in the F-16 lines. So right now, it's not in their longer term for the F-16 program as I'd sort of teed up to Noah's question, I think it was relative to the growth going forward. Right now, the F-16 line comes to an end at the end of -- or excuse me, the middle of 2018 or thereabouts. If we were to get the Bahrain order, that would extend it probably another year or so. But you should think that the F-16 program is not going away at all. In fact, if we look at 2017 -- I said '18. I think the line comes to end in 2017. Excuse me, I spoke a year off there. I think we have 6 aircraft deliveries in 2017. That's the wrap-up of the program from a build cycle versus 12 this year, and yet the sales, the F-16 program are higher next year than they are this year. And in part, that's because we have -- you should think of it of 3 large international upgrade programs going on concurrently or pretty much concurrently. We've got the Singaporean, the Taiwanese and a soon-to-be South Korean upgrade of their existing F-16 aircraft, which is actually, as it turns out more than offsetting the production quantity aircraft drop-off next year. So hopefully a little more color there. THAAD, Qatar, we had hoped to close that this year looking towards the end of this calendar year. That's in all likelihood not going to happen. We have it planned and expect to close that in 2017."

So let's see, on the purchase accounting, Sam, I'd say that's a little bit of just sort of housekeeping stuff, nothing hugely dramatic that occurred there, as some of these sorts of adjustments for things like inventory and so forth move around a little bit in part because of the timing of some of the deliveries associated with that inventory and just a better understanding of the business in total. All of the adjustments are required to be done 1 year after the purchase date, which I believe is November 6, so all those are required to be finalized in the fourth quarter. The one benefit that you should see going forward is we are going to have a lightening up, if you will, of the total conforming accounting and purchase accounting adjustments on Sikorsky of about -- I think about $150 million a year or so going forward. So from '16 to '17, that was what was always on the plan. The purchase accounting adjustments that we see happening this year really don't impact that much. You just talked about opportunities relative to the bottoming out in the military -- excuse me, in the commercial marketplace and so forth. We're seeing opportunities pop up. I think Marillyn hit these pretty well in terms of the Polish BLACK HAWK deal, which would be actually built and delivered out of Poland from our facility there, is an interesting opportunity. We have other international opportunities, although they're kind of coming in dribs and drabs, not huge orders, but they're still helping to sort of fill the backlog. As far as the commercial helo market, we don't expect to see that change. In fact, our projections and what we gave in the 7% increase next year essentially says we're flat to maybe a few less than in 2016. And we're hopeful and the numbers, with plans suggest that there's a slight uptick in 2018, but nothing huge. So we think this is a fairly slow recovery and not a spike by any stretch of imagination, but nothing between 2016 and 2017."

So let me try to address that, Joe. Actually, obviously, I did say that you got a good memory. I think the wildcard here is when I said that, I didn't expect to have the significant amount of growth on the F-35 program, particularly the sustainment piece of the F-35 program going from 2016 to 2017. I mean it's just amazing the growth that we're seeing on the sustainment program compared to what we previously thought, at least what I previously thought and what I was basing that margin comment on. So the margin that aero will likely be a little bit lighter in 2017 than it was in 2016. And most of that, but maybe not all of that, is driven by the F-35 significant ramp-up and again what I will always call the margin-dilutive algebraic effect of just a lower margin program growing faster than the rest of the business area, and that has dilutive effect on the margins. But as we look forward in the 2018 and I did tee up the C-5 and the F-16. Again, F-16 is not changing total sales volume all that much, although the aircraft quantities are coming down. C-5 is actually, again, a little bit dilutive to the overall margin. But because of the F-35 growth, it's occurring again between '18 and '17. I think the margin's kind of stay fairly constant probably as we look at this time for 2017 and 2018."

So F-35 deliveries, I should remind you this is a POC cost-to-cost contract, so the revenue is not impacted by deliveries, but you did make the right observation, George. The deliveries were light -- lighter than the third quarter than we'd otherwise suggest, and this is primarily because and I know you guys have read about this, but we have these insulation tubes that affected a number of our aircraft in the field as well as the aircraft being produced. And while we have the fix for that issue in place, think of this as a supplier-driven item that we had a sort of an out-of-spec delivery that was installed in the aircraft. And as we go through and fix those for the aircraft in the field, we're also going back and fixing the aircraft that are affected with those lines in production, and that is going to cause us to end up a little lighter in F-35 deliveries this year than what we previously had said. We think we know the solution for that, as I said. And we think the recover such that by the end of 2017, we're sort of back on contractual schedule, and hopefully sooner than the end of 2017, but that's the expectation right now. The other thing you talked about was F-35 being greater than $5 billion in the quarter or Aeronautics being greater than $5 billion in the quarter. That is -- that will be the highest quarter, I think, in the history of Aeronautics, but that's sort of tracking, George, to what we expect the annual run rate to look like in 2017. Years ago, we had talked about the Aeronautics business area being about a $20 billion per year revenue business in 2015. It turns out we were close, but that's likely going to happen now in 2017 as opposed to 2015. So that's tracking right with our expectations. And then the last question on the $300 million in sales and the risk retirements, and I think you said 8-point-something percent profit, that's sort of in line with what we've done. We've had quarters previous in this year that were higher, but that's because we had some of the risk retirements that we're talking to Howard about earlier that occurred in previous quarters. When we have those risk retirements, we kind of get a spike in the margin. We just didn't have as many this quarter, so the run rate you're seeing there is about the run rate without risk retirements in the quarter."

Going forward, this is what I was trying to convey in my remarks, while we have pension contributions at the level that you just described, the CAS recovery is also increasing pretty significantly and stays fairly high throughout this entire time frame. And that's again, essentially -- not essentially, but a good chunk of that is recovering that $7 billion of sort of pre-fund credit that we have at the end of this year.

Sikorsky is doing better than we had expected, at least through the first 3 quarters of this year. I think we started off with probably a little more conservative view of Sikorsky, just a little bit of not knowing the business as well as I think we do now. And so we've seen some performance improvements or some risk retirements, I should say, in the third quarter that translate into better performance than we were seeing in the first 2 quarters of the year. I think you also talked about the changes in intangible. And I might have misspoken. I think I was talking about conforming accounting and intangible amortization all rolled up into one. And there's definitely some reductions in some of the conforming accounting adjustments as well as I think one of the things that I teed up in the January call was there was about $30 million or $40 million of sort of severance cost left over in 2016 from a severance action that was taken in the middle of January -- middle of 2015 that does not repeat itself in 2017. That, along with sort of lower integration costs in 2017 compared to 2016, is what's driving the improvements that I talked about."

So the performance -- that you described as performance, I wouldn't necessarily characterize as performance, just the growth in sustainment activity that we see. And why was I surprised or why did I seem like I was surprised. I think, to a certain extent, this is a little bit -- I won't say out of our control entirely, but it is dependent upon when the government establishes sort of the base setups for the induction of F-35 aircraft and what level of support those bases need in order to be ready to take on operational F-35 aircraft. And I'll say we were probably a little conservative or maybe a lot conservative in our forecast as far as thinking that the level -- if you just think of all the things that have to be at a base, day 1, when you start delivering aircraft to that base and all the alternate mission equipment, all the support equipment and things to pull aircraft around, ladders to get on there, I mean, you could just get on all the stuff that has to go into a base. And I'll say we were probably pretty light on that forecast until we had some of those bases under our belt. And now we have some of those bases under our belt and we have a better understanding of what sort of the average needs are of the aircraft going forward. And so that's what we're projecting going forward, and I think we've got a much better handle on that going forward than we have in the past. That's all good news as far as I'm concerned. Looking forward, you asked about the margin trajectory. I wouldn't expect to see huge swings in margin associated with sustainment. We typically get margins on sustainment and they're kind of negotiated concurrently with the aircraft program. They're kind of negotiated at about similar levels of profitability, so I wouldn't expect to see a swing either way because of production or sustainment. It might remind you that, over time, the development program, the SDD contract is winding down over time. And again, that will end eventually, unless we continue to put development efforts on there, but that's going down next year. That's one of the things that's helping to mitigate some of the Aeronautics loss dilution from the F-35 program."

In addition to our discussion of financial results and outlooks, I want to highlight a few operational accomplishments in our business areas and other key events in the quarter, including DoD budget status and the successful disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business.
Looking at the summary financials, our team continued to deliver strong results across the corporation, with third quarter sales, continuing operations profit, earnings per share and cash from operations all exceeding internal plans. We are driving towards achievement of full year 2016 goals, and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2017, fueled by top line growth in our streamlined
 
[Audio Gap] 
Bruce will provide a detailed review of the financial results, 2016 full year outlook, 2017 preliminary trends outlook and assumptions in his comments later in the call. 
The first area I want to speak to is our cash generation and deployment. This quarter, we achieved over $1.3 billion in cash from operations, bringing September year-to-date cash generation to approximately $4.5 billion. While we have achieved strong year-to-date cash performance, I would note that our fourth quarter outlook contains a higher-than-normal level of significant F-35 cash timing events. Successful closure of these events is dependent on completions of various contractual negotiations before the end of the year. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved 2 key actions in the area of cash deployment. First, the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.82 per share and $7.28 annually. This action represents the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double-digit percentage. Second, share repurchase authority was increased by $2 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion at the end of the third quarter. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make significant cash -- significant future share repurchases. 
In recent actions taken by our board, these will enable us to continue our shareholder-friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. 
Before examining our third quarter results, I wanted to briefly touch on the status of the fiscal year 2017 DoD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution through December 9 that limits expenditures to prior year fiscal levels. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible. While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY '17 year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings and cash flows in 2017 as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years. There are multiple and differing budget scenarios under consideration for the FY '17 budgets. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budget funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DoD-based budget. Reconciliation of the different budget -- DoD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope this is not the case as it is not in the best interest of our nation. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 9. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of FY '17 budgets to remove the uncertainty resulting from nonstrategic short-term government funding actions.
Moving to operations. While there were numerous mission success events across the corporation this quarter, I will limit my comments to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. A highlight of the quarter was the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model being declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force and achieving Initial Operational Capability or IOC. This declaration reflects the maturity and performance of the CTOL aircraft and successful achievement of all key criteria to reach IOC readiness. The IOC enables the U.S. Air Force to be the second branch of the military to field combat-ready F-35 aircraft as they join the U.S. Marine Corps with their operational F-35B aircraft in providing unequaled fifth-generation fighters to our nation and allies. With over 70% of the more than 3,000 aircraft production plans for the F-35 being the CTOL variant, achievement of IOC for this aircraft strengthens the foundation for future decades of fighter production for domestic and international customers. 
In addition to the achievement of the IOC milestone, the F-35 also demonstrated the benefit of its unique fusion -- fused sensors in its first live-fire missile intercept event. By leveraging a U.S. Marine Corps F-35 and the U.S. Navy's Aegis Weapon System, the aircraft demonstrated the ability of the F-35 to greatly expand the target identification and acquisition range in its support of naval integrated fire-control missions. The F-35 served as an elevated sensor and detected an over-the-horizon missile threat. It then utilized its advanced data link to send data to an Aegis Weapon System that subsequently engaged and destroyed the target. This fusion of sensors across multiple systems only begins to outline the potential enhanced war fighting capabilities and distributed lethality that F-35 aircraft will enable across our military forces. This capability is embedded in all F-35 variants today and is just one of the revolutionary technologies that this aircraft brings to our nation and allies.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35. Key milestones this past quarter included rollout of the first F-35A aircraft for the Japan Air Self Defense Force; marking a major milestone in Japan's enhanced national security defense and strengthening the future of the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Japan continues to reflect a planned procurement of 42 aircraft for their national defense requirements. 
Beyond the activities for Japan, Norway became the first international partner nation to state its intention to participate in a multiyear multinational block buy of the F-35. Norway outlined a request for 12 F-35 fighters in their 2017 budget and remains on track to their stated plan to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for their national defense. 
We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively field this fifth-generation fighter for decades to come.
I'd like to turn to a different topic and provide you a status report on one of the strategic goals we outlined to you 2 years ago. At the time, we challenged ourselves to expand our focus and footprint overseas and established a goal to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to the change in our portfolio of content, resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the disposition of IS&GS, we are on track to exceed that goal later this year as the remaining business areas perform a significantly high proportion of international work banded IS&GS. International work across the corporation is expanding, especially in the areas of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes and tactical missiles. The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world. 
Our proven and cost-effective solutions are securing awards from new customers worldwide. We are seeing demand for our equipment ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle East theaters. This demand helps strengthen growth as our international portfolio is growing at a faster rate than the DoD budget. Higher international work is also providing greater economies of scale that enhances our ability to improve the affordability of platforms and services to both domestic and international customers. 
We are expanding our efforts across all of our business areas to provide our products to international customers. With this focus remaining a key element in our growth strategy for the corporation, we now expect to increase our international sales content to at least 30% of total annual sales in the next few years. I am confident that we have the portfolio, strategy and personnel to achieve this new, higher level as we move forward.
I want to conclude my comments by recognizing one of the key accomplishments this past quarter: the successful completion of our strategic disposition of the IS&GS business to Leidos. Closure of the disposition through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust better positions that business to generate shareholder value and opportunities for employees as they move forward outside our corporation. This RMT transaction generated the highest value creation benefits to our stockholders and allows us to focus even more intensely on our remaining core DoD portfolio. Completion of the transaction enabled retirement of over 9 million shares of our stock through the exchange offers plus receipt of $1.8 billion in cash to our corporation. We are deploying that cash through dividends, share repurchases and debt retirement, and are on track for full deployment of the cash before the end of this year.
I'll close by stating that we have taken significant actions over the past year to reshape our portfolio and strengthen our core defense business. I'm confident this positions us well to grow and deliver long-term value to our stockholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,403600085,1060701,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Our",2348,"Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. 
Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half results, and we are ahead of our plan in all key financial measures through the first 3 quarters of the year. As you are aware, we completed the split-off of the IS&GS business area during the quarter, and both our current and historical results are now stated on a continuing operations basis. 
During the second quarter call, we also identified several other events that we expected to occur in the third quarter that would impact our financial results, and we'll provide an update on these events in the coming charts. And we'll provide our updated 2016 outlook, taking into consideration all of these items in subsequent charts. So we're pleased with our strong results in the quarter and with our outlook for the year in total.
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter with the third quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.5 billion or 15% this year than last year. And similar to the second quarter, the growth was driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of RMS for about $1.2 billion and over $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by higher F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was about $180 million higher than last year with the growth coming primarily from Space Systems as a result of better performance and the book gain associated with the consolidation of AWE that we will discuss in more detail on the next chart. 
Chart 5 highlights the key financial events impacting earnings in the quarter that we previewed during the July call. From a continuing operations perspective, the largest impact was the $127 million book gain associated with our obtaining a controlling interest in AWE that resulted in a $0.34 favorable impact in the quarter and the year. That gain was partially offset by the initial amortization of an intangible asset associated with the gain, which reduced EPS in the quarter by a $0.01 and $0.06 for the year. The intangible amortization will continue on an accelerated basis over the next 8 years. 
Next, we moved the FAS/CAS pension adjustment associated with IS&GS into discontinued operations, and that lowered EPS by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. And we updated our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in both the quarter and the year. We are substantially complete with the purchase accounting for Sikorsky and do not expect significant changes as we close this effort in the fourth quarter. All told, these impacts to continuing operations EPS added $0.27 in the quarter and $0.11 for the year. In discontinued operations, we recognize the book gain of about $1.2 billion associated with the disposition of IS&GS as well as their 2016 operating results up until the August disposition date. These 2 items amounted to $4.32 of EPS in the quarter and $4.97 for the year. 
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll see how our earnings per share in the quarter compare with the EPS from 1 year ago. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.61, which was aided by the $0.27 benefit we described in the prior chart. In addition, the third quarter benefited from improved operating performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment, the lower tax rate and lower share count than in the third quarter of 2015.
On Chart 7, you can see our cash from operations this quarter compared to last year. Cash in the quarter was around $1.3 billion, about $200 million lower than the third quarter of 2015 and continues to be impacted by our decision to fund F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 in excess of the amount of government funding. At the end of the quarter, that exposure was $950 million. While we did receive additional funding for LRIP 9 during the quarter, that funding was not sufficient to match the growth in both LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 expenditures in the quarter, resulting in the increased exposure from the second quarter. We remain hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon but have concerns with receiving collections before year-end as we'll discuss when we show our revised outlook for the year in a few charts.
Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders on a year-to-date basis. With just under $4.5 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and about $600 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow so far this year is around $3.8 billion. With $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.3 billion in shares repurchased to date, we have returned $2.8 billion to stockholders or 73% of free cash flow. And in the third quarter, we increased both our dividend rate and share repurchase authority, as Marillyn highlighted in her comments earlier. 
On Chart 9, you can see the significant reduction in our share count over time, from our peak share count of 456 million shares in 2002, we've reduced shares outstanding to 293 million, 36% less than we had at the peak. And adjusting our previously stated goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, for the 9 million of share reductions from the RMT exchange offer, we expect to achieve the restated goal of 291 million shares by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned. 
Chart 10 provides the updated outlook for the year. On the chart, we have 3 columns. The first shows the outlook we provided during the second quarter call. The middle column shows the same outlook adjusted for the removal of IS&GS results, and the third column shows the revised outlook compared with the middle column. We increased our sales outlook above the high end of the previous guidance to $46.5 billion, and this was driven primarily by higher sales expectations for Aeronautics and Space Systems. Segment operating profit was also increased above the high end of the previous guidance, also driven by Aeronautics and Space Systems. We increased earnings per share from continuing operations to around $12.10, reflecting the strong third quarter results. And we are giving 2 views of cash from operations: One, assuming we do collect billings for the F-35 program before year-end; and one assuming those collections slip into 2017. Assuming we do collect F-35 billings, our cash outlook is greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, a $350 million improvement over the restated second quarter outlook, and this improvement reflects strong cash performance at RMS, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control. If the F-35 collections split into 2017, our outlook for 2016 would be greater than or equal to $5 billion. The $700 million difference in the outlooks would be a digital event at year-end. If it slips out of 2016, 2017 will be $700 million higher. If it does not, 2016 will be $700 million higher, but the total cash between the 2 years will not change. And we'll elaborate more on that in a few charts.
Chart 11 shows our prior sales outlook compared with the current outlook by business area. Compared with the midpoint of our previous guidance, we are increasing our sales outlook by $900 million with Space Systems and Aeronautics driving the change. Space Systems increased due to consolidation of AWE results into our financial statements, while Aeronautics grew due primarily to continued higher-than-expected sales performance on the F-35 program. 
Chart 12 provides the same outlook update for segment operating profit. As with sales, the segment operating profit outlook was driven by increases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. The increase in Aeronautics was driven primarily by the additional F-35 sales volume and improved performance across several programs. The increase in Space Systems was driven by the AWE consolidation gain as well as improved performance in government satellites. 
On Chart 13, we provide our preliminary trends information for 2017. We expect sales to increase around 7% above the 2016 level, with most of the increase coming from Aeronautics' growth driven by F-35 production and sustainment, and Missiles and Fire Control growth driven by higher air missile defense sales. RMS and Space Systems about offset each other next year, with slight growth in RMS being offset by lower sales in Space Systems as the additional AWE volume for a full year in 2017 compared to a partial 2016 is more than offset by lower volume in our government satellite business as well as the absence of any commercial launch activity next year. We expect segment operating margin to range between 10% to 10.5% with the reduction from the 2016 levels driven primarily by a full year of consolidated AWE sales in 2017 without the benefit of the gain in 2016, lower ULA equity earnings due to the mix and volume of launch vehicles expected in 2017 as well as the end of the $40 million annual deferred gain in 2016 and the significant volume increase in F-35 sales at a lower margin rate than the average for the corporation.
Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, again assuming the F-35 collections slide into 2017. We'll provide more color on our longer-term views on cash from operations on the next chart. And we're planning to have at least $2 billion of share repurchases next year, which we expect will further reduce our share count below the 290 million share level. 
Our updated pension outlook assumes a FAS/CAS adjustment of $800 million of income, higher than we discussed during the second quarter call. Interest rates have risen slightly since the last call, and we now see a discount rate of 3.625% rather than the 3.5% we mentioned last quarter. In addition, a new longevity table was published late last week that results in another improvement to the FAS/CAS projection we provided last quarter. 
On the next 2 charts, we provide a longer-term view of both cash from operations and our pension impacts. Beginning with Chart 14 and our longer-term trend for cash from operations, during the third quarter of 2014, we established a goal of generating more than $15 billion of total operating cash for the years 2015 to 2017; significantly higher than prior years as we were expecting what we called a pension funding holiday for that 3-year period. As you can see from the chart, assuming the F-35 collections slip into 2017 and based on our 2-year view of cash for 2016 and 2017, we expect to generate around $15.8 billion over the 3-year time frame, significantly exceeding the 2014 goal. If we look forward to the next 3 years beginning with 2017, we also expect to generate at least $15 billion of total operating cash between 2017 and 2019 with all years at or near $5 billion even after we begin to make required pension contributions in both 2018 and 2019. 
On Chart 15, we provide a view of our expectations for both the FAS/CAS adjustment and cash implications of our pension plan over a longer time frame. All of our projections on this chart assume an 8% return on assets every year and a constant discount rate of 3.625%. As most of you know, we have a significant pre-funding balance that represents the difference between our pension contributions as required by ERISA and the recovery of those contributions via our CAS billings to the government.
At the end of 2016, we expect that pre-fund credit balance to be around $7 billion, and we expect to recover a sizable portion of that $7 billion through the year 2025, which means that our CAS recoveries should exceed required pension contributions in all years through 2025, providing a cash tailwind even during years with required contributions. And as many of you also recall, our pension plan was modified in 2014 in a 2-step process that results in the plan becoming fully frozen at the end of 2019. The first step of the plan modification began in 2016 with the freeze to the salary levels used to calculate pension benefits. This means that between 2017 and 2019, our FAS expense will decrease while our CAS expense increases to recognize the recovery of the pre-fund balance. At the end of 2019, we have the second step of our plan modification, a freezing of the years of service used to calculate pension benefits. And at this point, the plan becomes fully frozen. Beginning in 2020, we will no longer have service accruals for our salaried workforce, and this creates a number of changes to our FAS/CAS adjustment because of the full freeze. We will no longer recognize service cost for the frozen plan, and the amortization period for previous actuarial losses or gains will be extended from roughly 9 years to about 18 years in length. The combination of these changes will likely result in FAS income rather than FAS expense beginning in 2020 as our expected FAS asset returns will exceed the cost elements in our FAS calculation. This means we would expect to have considerable FAS/CAS adjustment income growth between 2017 to 2019 and then see significantly higher FAS/CAS adjustment income beginning in 2020 going forward for the foreseeable future based on current assumptions. 
That leads us to our summary on Chart 16. We had a strong operational and financial -- we had strong operational and financial performance in the quarter and expect to finish the year in a similar fashion. We completed the IS&GS RMT transaction in a manner that was beneficial to the IS&GS business and Lockheed Martin stockholders. The strategic actions we've taken over the past year have strengthened our portfolio and will enable us for future growth. And we have long-term trends and cash from operations and pension impacts that position us to continue to deliver value to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Andrea?"

And I'd say we haven't really reached closure on any of those 3, but we're making progress every day towards that closure. So still hopeful we'll close soon. I think the latter part of your question was were there risks to the margins. And you should think of at least the near-term margins are really impacted by contracts that were negotiated much prior to LRIPs 9 and 10. So especially 2016 and 2017 has very little, if anything, to do with the margin performance in LRIP 9 and 10. The latter years, obviously, are much greater impacted. We're still looking to have margins on the F-35 program eventually get to mirror or mimic what we've seen in the similar life cycle of the F-16 programs and C-130 programs, and that's still our objective as we sit here today."

We still have some remaining options eligible to be exercised, and those options are just proving to be a lot stickier in the past few years than they have been in the years previously. So we're getting some benefit from where we had planned levels of option exercise just coming in lighter than expected. You talked about the $1.8 billion on the Leidos special cash payment, so we've spent most of that through the first 3 quarters. I want to say it's around $400-some-odd million. It's -- I know it's a little less than that as we sit here today. We made the debt retirement of about $0.5 billion in the month of September. And a pretty good chunk of it has gone towards share repurchases and dividends, including the third quarter dividend that we just made. So our expectation is that we will have consumed the full $1.8 billion in capital allocations by the end of the year.

So I think you're pretty close to being right. So I think you should think of the AWE, which I'm not sure if it's organic or inorganic, by the way, but you should think of AWE as contributing about roughly $400 million in sales this year, probably growing to a little over $1 billion, $1.1 billion next year, so maybe $700 million of change, so that's probably a little less than 2%. So we would think that growth organically, as you described it, from year-over-year is probably in the high 4s, maybe a little bit around 5% or so next year. Going forward for the next 3 years or so, we still believe, we kind of talked about in the second quarter call that we think we have growth ranging from about 3% to 5% in the out-years. We still feel good about that. Although it's probably not as steady over those years as you might think, so we have the sort of a bigger uptick that we're expecting in 2017, a lot of that driven by the F-35 program. We see additional growth in 2018 also by F-35, but there's a countervailing issue happening because we have the end of the F-16 production line and the end of C-5 deliveries, both of which occur in 2018. So while we still see growth, organic growth in '18, it will be a little bit diminished because of those 2 events but still better than we've seen for the last few years. And then, frankly, as we sit here today and look at the longer term, 2019 is a higher growth rate than 2018, in part because of the absence of those 2 events."

So you're right. And I think just from conversations that we've had at conferences and with investors as they've toured through Bethesda, there was a lot of misunderstanding perhaps relative to our ability to continue to generate cash flow from operations when we started having pension contributions. So we wanted to tee up that we do think we're going to continue to have strong cash from operations, which is the reason why we came up with a new goal -- essentially the same as the old goal -- for a 3-year period with a common 2017 in both of those 3-year goals. The amount of pension contributions, we have 0 in '17 for all intents and purposes. We have some sort of minor contributions relative to the Sikorsky collective bargaining pension plan, but for all intents and purposes, that's pretty minimal. In 2018 and 2019, it's still a little fluid at this point in time, but you should think of both of those years probably ranging between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of pension contributions. So we are able to essentially mimic what we did with the pension funding holiday because we do expect to have sort of organic, if I could use that term, operational cash growth, and most of that comes from the F-35 program going forward. The Sikorsky business, which we described as sort of treading water for a number of years from a cash flow perspective and then as we finish a lot of the development programs and a couple of the loss programs, frankly, that we have within Sikorsky, we expect to see a return to cash generation. And then the last one is the international growth that we talked about, that Marillyn talked about earlier. So those 3 elements have then sort of everyone else holding constant is contributing mightily towards that level. And then I'll remind you, maybe -- I know you know this, Rich, but while we do make those pension contributions and that's a hit to operating cash, they're also tax deductible, so that's a 35% offset to what we see there as well."

So we got a lot of already booked business that will come in towards those international sales. And so I think our portfolio is really well positioned for growth.

I mean, from a PAC-3 standpoint, we do partner with Raytheon on the Patriot systems, so we continue to sell PAC-3s around the world. And we just declared our initial operating capability for the PAC-3 MSE, the Missile Segment Enhancement, which has extended range and greater capabilities. So we're going to have a continued demand for the PAC-3 MSE. I think we'll see countries that will look at buying that greater capability. On THAAD, as we -- it's in the UAE today, of course, and there's a strong pull for THAAD in the Middle East, Qatar and potentially Saudi and others will be looking at THAAD going forward. On Aegis, Aegis we just -- with Korea and Japan. They're adding it to their ships, and we'll have other countries, I think, moving along in that regard. Aegis Ashore, we've set up our Aegis Ashore in Romania, and we see an opportunity in Poland. And then from a competition standpoint, MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, now that Germany has made their selection, we expect other NATO countries to be looking at MEADS and maybe some Middle East countries looking at MEADS as a potential for their capability with its 360-degree capability and really the next generation beyond the Patriot system as the new system. So Poland is still looking at MEADS, for example, and we've had some interest from some Middle East countries on MEADS. And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent is another opportunity for us on growth in missile defense in the U.S. and so not just in the international marketplace, we continue to see growth on the domestic market for our missile defense capabilities. So hopefully, that answers your question. I think over time, the defensive systems that countries need, we expect they will continue to put in place. The threats are not diminishing, they're increasing. And so the defensive systems that we can provide are what we hear from countries around the world that they want, whether it's Japan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or others as I travel around the world, that is a top priority for these countries."

It's not finalized by any stretch of imagination. And none of the numbers that I talked about previously in terms of the growth going forward assume the Bahraini aircraft in the F-16 lines. So right now, it's not in their longer term for the F-16 program as I'd sort of teed up to Noah's question, I think it was relative to the growth going forward. Right now, the F-16 line comes to an end at the end of -- or excuse me, the middle of 2018 or thereabouts. If we were to get the Bahrain order, that would extend it probably another year or so. But you should think that the F-16 program is not going away at all. In fact, if we look at 2017 -- I said '18. I think the line comes to an end in 2017. Excuse me, I spoke a year off there. I think we have 6 aircraft deliveries in 2017. That's the wrap-up of the program from a build cycle versus 12 this year, and yet the sales, the F-16 program are higher next year than they are this year. And in part, that's because we have -- you should think of it of it as 3 large international upgrade programs going on concurrently or pretty much concurrently. We've got the Singaporean, the Taiwanese and a soon-to-be South Korean upgrade of their existing F-16 aircraft, which is actually, as it turns out more than offsetting the production quantity aircraft drop-off next year.

So let's see, on the purchase accounting, Sam, I'd say that's a little bit of just sort of housekeeping stuff, nothing hugely dramatic that occurred there, as some of these sorts of adjustments for things like inventory and so forth move around a little bit in part because of the timing of some of the deliveries associated with that inventory and just a better understanding of the business in total. All of the adjustments are required to be done 1 year after the purchase date, which I believe is November 6, so all those are required to be finalized in the fourth quarter. The one benefit that you should see going forward is we are going to have a lightening up, if you will, of the total conforming accounting and purchase accounting adjustments on Sikorsky of about -- I think about $150 million a year or so going forward. So from '16 to '17, that was what was always on the plan. The purchase accounting adjustments that we see happening this year really don't impact that much. You just talked about opportunities relative to the bottoming out in the military -- excuse me, in the commercial marketplace and so forth. We're seeing opportunities pop up. I think Marillyn hit these pretty well in terms of the Polish BLACK HAWK deal, which would be actually built and delivered out of Poland from our facility there, is an interesting opportunity. We have other international opportunities, although they're kind of coming in dribs and drabs, not huge orders, but they're still helping to sort of fill the backlog. As far as the commercial helo market, we don't expect to see that change. In fact, our projections and what we gave in the 7% increase next year essentially says we're flat to maybe a few less than in 2016. And we're hopeful and the numbers, we'd plan suggest that there's a slight uptick in 2018, but nothing huge. So we think this is a fairly slow recovery and not a spike by any stretch of imagination, but nothing between 2016 and 2017."

Actually, obviously, I did say that. You've got a good memory. I think the wildcard here is when I said that, I didn't expect to have the significant amount of growth on the F-35 program, particularly the sustainment piece of the F-35 program going from 2016 to 2017. I mean it's just amazing the growth that we're seeing on the sustainment program compared to what we previously thought, at least what I previously thought and what I was basing that margin comment on. So the margin at aero will likely be a little bit lighter in 2017 than it was in 2016. And most of that, but maybe not all of that, is driven by the F-35 significant ramp-up and again what I will always call the margin-dilutive algebraic effect of just a lower margin program growing faster than the rest of the business area, and that has dilutive effect on the margins. But as we look forward in the 2018 and I did tee up the C-5 and the F-16. Again, F-16 is not changing total sales volume all that much, although the aircraft quantities are coming down. C-5 is actually, again, a little bit dilutive to the overall margin. But because of the F-35 growth, it's occurring again between '18 and '17. I think the margin's kind of stay fairly constant probably as we look at this time for 2017 and 2018."

So F-35 deliveries, I should remind you this is a POC cost-to-cost contract, so the revenue is not impacted by deliveries, but you did make the right observation, George. The deliveries were light -- lighter than the third quarter than we'd otherwise suggest, and this is primarily because and I know you guys have read about this, but we have these insulation tubes that affected a number of our aircraft in the field as well as the aircraft being produced. And while we have the fix for that issue in place, think of this as a supplier-driven item that we had a sort of an out-of-spec delivery that was installed in the aircraft. And as we go through and fix those for the aircraft in the field, we're also going back and fixing the aircraft that are affected with those lines in production, and that is going to cause us to end up a little lighter in F-35 deliveries this year than what we previously had said. We think we know the solution for that, as I said. And we think we recover such that by the end of 2017, we're sort of back on contractual schedule, and hopefully sooner than the end of 2017, but that's the expectation right now. The other thing you talked about was F-35 being greater than $5 billion in the quarter or Aeronautics being greater than $5 billion in the quarter. That is -- that will be the highest quarter, I think, in the history of Aeronautics, but that's sort of tracking, George, to what we expect the annual run rate to look like in 2017. Years ago, we had talked about the Aeronautics business area being about a $20 billion per year revenue business in 2015. It turns out we were close, but that's likely going to happen now in 2017 as opposed to 2015. So that's tracking right with our expectations. And then the last question on the $300 million in sales and the risk retirements, and I think you said 8-point-something percent profit, that's sort of in line with what we've done. We've had quarters previous in this year that were higher, but that's because we had some of the risk retirements that we're talking to Howard about earlier that occurred in previous quarters. When we have those risk retirements, we kind of get a spike in the margin. We just didn't have as many this quarter, so the run rate you're seeing there is about the run rate without risk retirements in the quarter."

So again, we talked about '15 to '17 having a pension holiday, that means we did -- we're not going to make pension contributions; so significant level of sort of pension recovery because of that. Going forward, this is what I was trying to convey in my remarks, while we have pension contributions at the level that you just described, the CAS recovery is also increasing pretty significantly and stays fairly high throughout this entire time frame. And that's again, essentially -- not essentially, but a good chunk of that is recovering that $7 billion of sort of pre-fund credit that we have at the end of this year. So that has to sort of come back at some point in the CAS billings that we have to the government. That's what sustains us over that time, even though the net cash for pension is coming down, the offset is due to operational cash going up."

And that's, again, back to Rob's question, that's one thing that's driving the cash recovery over that period of time. Sikorsky is doing better than we had expected, at least through the first 3 quarters of this year. I think we started off with probably a little more conservative view of Sikorsky, just a little bit of not knowing the business as well as I think we do now. And so we've seen some performance improvements or some risk retirements, I should say, in the third quarter that translate into better performance than we were seeing in the first 2 quarters of the year. I think you also talked about the changes in intangible. And I might have misspoken. I think I was talking about conforming accounting and intangible amortization all rolled up into one. And there's definitely some reductions in some of the conforming accounting adjustments as well as I think one of the things that I teed up in the January call was there was about $30 million or $40 million of sort of severance cost left over in 2016 from a severance action that was taken in the middle of January -- middle of 2015 that does not repeat itself in 2017.

So the performance -- that you described as performance, I wouldn't necessarily characterize as performance, just the growth in sustainment activity that we see. And why was I surprised or why did I seem like I was surprised? I think, to a certain extent, this is a little bit -- I won't say out of our control entirely, but it is dependent upon when the government establishes sort of the base setups for the induction of F-35 aircraft and what level of support those bases need in order to be ready to take on operational F-35 aircraft. And I'll say we were probably a little conservative or maybe a lot conservative in our forecast as far as thinking that the level of -- if you just think of all the things that have to be at a base, day 1, when you start delivering aircraft to that base and all the alternate mission equipment, all the support equipment and things to pull aircraft around, ladders to get on there, I mean, you could just get on all the stuff that has to go into a base. And I'll say we were probably pretty light on that forecast until we had some of those bases under our belt. And now we have some of those bases under our belt and we have a better understanding of what sort of the average needs are of the aircraft going forward. And so that's what we're projecting going forward, and I think we've got a much better handle on that going forward than we had in the past. That's all good news as far as I'm concerned. Looking forward, you asked about the margin trajectory. I wouldn't expect to see huge swings in margin associated with sustainment. We typically get margins on sustainment and they're kind of negotiated concurrently with the aircraft program. They're kind of negotiated at about similar levels of profitability, so I wouldn't expect to see a swing either way because of production or sustainment. I might remind you that, over time, the development program, the SDD contract is winding down over time. And again, that will end eventually, unless we continue to put development efforts on there, but that's going down next year. That's one of the things that's helping to mitigate some of the Aeronautics loss dilution from the F-35 program."

The underperformance to the 8% has a compounding effect that says you have to have higher CAS contributions going forward, and that's simplistically the reason for the range we're giving today is simply the asset returns. C-130, previous years, we did have some pretty good size pickups or step-ups or risk retirements relative to the third quarter last year, but you're also seeing, as you described it, sort of the lower booking rate on the newly negotiated multiyear contract that has an effect of having a lower profit rate than we've seen in the past years on the C-130 program."

As today's release details, we continue to move forward financially, operationally and strategically while delivering critical solutions to customers and returning value to stockholders. 
In addition to our discussion of financial results and outlooks, I want to highlight a few operational accomplishments in our business areas and other key events in the quarter, including DoD budget status and the successful disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business.
Looking at the summary financials, our team continued to deliver strong results across the corporation, with third quarter sales, continuing operations profit, earnings per share and cash from operations all exceeding internal plans. We are driving towards achievement of full year 2016 goals, and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2017, fueled by top line growth in our streamlined
 
[Audio Gap] 
Bruce will provide a detailed review of the financial results, 2016 full year outlook, 2017 preliminary trends outlook and assumptions in his comments later in the call. 
The first area I want to speak to is our cash generation and deployment. This quarter, we achieved over $1.3 billion in cash from operations, bringing September year-to-date cash generation to approximately $4.5 billion. While we have achieved strong year-to-date cash performance, I would note that our fourth quarter outlook contains a higher-than-normal level of significant F-35 cash timing events. Successful closure of these events is dependent on completions of various contractual negotiations before the end of the year. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved 2 key actions in the area of cash deployment. First, the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.82 per share and $7.28 annually. This action represents the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double-digit percentage. Second, share repurchase authority was increased by $2 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion at the end of the third quarter. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make significant cash -- significant future share repurchases. 
In recent actions taken by our board, these will enable us to continue our shareholder-friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit. 
Before examining our third quarter results, I wanted to briefly touch on the status of the fiscal year 2017 DoD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution through December 9 that limits expenditures to prior year fiscal levels. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible. While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY '17 year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings and cash flows in 2017 as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years. There are multiple and differing budget scenarios under consideration for the FY '17 budgets. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budget funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DoD-based budget. Reconciliation of the different budget -- DoD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope this is not the case as it is not in the best interest of our nation. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 9. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of FY '17 budgets to remove the uncertainty resulting from nonstrategic short-term government funding actions.
Moving to operations. While there were numerous mission success events across the corporation this quarter, I will limit my comments to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. A highlight of the quarter was the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model being declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force and achieving Initial Operational Capability or IOC. This declaration reflects the maturity and performance of the CTOL aircraft and successful achievement of all key criteria to reach IOC readiness. The IOC enables the U.S. Air Force to be the second branch of the military to field combat-ready F-35 aircraft as they join the U.S. Marine Corps with their operational F-35B aircraft in providing unequaled fifth-generation fighters to our nation and allies. With over 70% of the more than 3,000 aircraft production plans for the F-35 being the CTOL variant, achievement of IOC for this aircraft strengthens the foundation for future decades of fighter production for domestic and international customers. 
In addition to the achievement of the IOC milestone, the F-35 also demonstrated the benefit of its unique fusion -- fused sensors in its first live-fire missile intercept event. By leveraging a U.S. Marine Corps F-35 and the U.S. Navy's Aegis Weapon System, the aircraft demonstrated the ability of the F-35 to greatly expand the target identification and acquisition range in its support of naval integrated fire-control missions. The F-35 served as an elevated sensor and detected an over-the-horizon missile threat. It then utilized its advanced data link to send data to an Aegis Weapon System that subsequently engaged and destroyed the target. This fusion of sensors across multiple systems only begins to outline the potential enhanced war fighting capabilities and distributed lethality that F-35 aircraft will enable across our military forces. This capability is embedded in all F-35 variants today and is just one of the revolutionary technologies that this aircraft brings to our nation and allies.
Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35. Key milestones this past quarter included rollout of the first F-35A aircraft for the Japan Air Self Defense Force; marking a major milestone in Japan's enhanced national security defense and strengthening the future of the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Japan continues to reflect a planned procurement of 42 aircraft for their national defense requirements. 
Beyond the activities for Japan, Norway became the first international partner nation to state its intention to participate in a multiyear multinational block buy of the F-35. Norway outlined a request for 12 F-35 fighters in their 2017 budget and remains on track to their stated plan to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for their national defense. 
We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies as we collectively field this fifth-generation fighter for decades to come.
I'd like to turn to a different topic and provide you a status report on one of the strategic goals we outlined to you 2 years ago. At the time, we challenged ourselves to expand our focus and footprint overseas and established a goal to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to the change in our portfolio of content, resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the disposition of IS&GS, we are on track to exceed that goal later this year as the remaining business areas perform a significantly high proportion of international work banded IS&GS. International work across the corporation is expanding, especially in the areas of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes and tactical missiles. The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world. 
Our proven and cost-effective solutions are securing awards from new customers worldwide. We are seeing demand for our equipment ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle East theaters. This demand helps strengthen growth as our international portfolio is growing at a faster rate than the DoD budget. Higher international work is also providing greater economies of scale that enhances our ability to improve the affordability of platforms and services to both domestic and international customers. 
We are expanding our efforts across all of our business areas to provide our products to international customers. With this focus remaining a key element in our growth strategy for the corporation, we now expect to increase our international sales content to at least 30% of total annual sales in the next few years. I am confident that we have the portfolio, strategy and personnel to achieve this new, higher level as we move forward.
I want to conclude my comments by recognizing one of the key accomplishments this past quarter: the successful completion of our strategic disposition of the IS&GS business to Leidos. Closure of the disposition through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust better positions that business to generate shareholder value and opportunities for employees as they move forward outside our corporation. This RMT transaction generated the highest value creation benefits to our stockholders and allows us to focus even more intensely on our remaining core DoD portfolio. Completion of the transaction enabled retirement of over 9 million shares of our stock through the exchange offers plus receipt of $1.8 billion in cash to our corporation. We are deploying that cash through dividends, share repurchases and debt retirement, and are on track for full deployment of the cash before the end of this year.
I'll close by stating that we have taken significant actions over the past year to reshape our portfolio and strengthen our core defense business. I'm confident this positions us well to grow and deliver long-term value to our stockholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions."
285827,403600085,1061131,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Our",2348,"Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. 
Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half results, and we are ahead of our plan in all key financial measures through the first 3 quarters of the year. As you are aware, we completed the split-off of the IS&GS business area during the quarter, and both our current and historical results are now stated on a continuing operations basis. 
During the second quarter call, we also identified several other events that we expected to occur in the third quarter that would impact our financial results, and we'll provide an update on these events in the coming charts. And we'll provide our updated 2016 outlook, taking into consideration all of these items in subsequent charts. So we're pleased with our strong results in the quarter and with our outlook for the year in total.
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter with the third quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.5 billion or 15% this year than last year. And similar to the second quarter, the growth was driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of RMS for about $1.2 billion and over $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by higher F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was about $180 million higher than last year with the growth coming primarily from Space Systems as a result of better performance and the book gain associated with the consolidation of AWE that we will discuss in more detail on the next chart. 
Chart 5 highlights the key financial events impacting earnings in the quarter that we previewed during the July call. From a continuing operations perspective, the largest impact was the $127 million book gain associated with our obtaining a controlling interest in AWE that resulted in a $0.34 favorable impact in the quarter and the year. That gain was partially offset by the initial amortization of an intangible asset associated with the gain, which reduced EPS in the quarter by a $0.01 and $0.06 for the year. The intangible amortization will continue on an accelerated basis over the next 8 years. 
Next, we moved the FAS/CAS pension adjustment associated with IS&GS into discontinued operations, and that lowered EPS by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. And we updated our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in both the quarter and the year. We are substantially complete with the purchase accounting for Sikorsky and do not expect significant changes as we close this effort in the fourth quarter. All told, these impacts to continuing operations EPS added $0.27 in the quarter and $0.11 for the year. In discontinued operations, we recognize the book gain of about $1.2 billion associated with the disposition of IS&GS as well as their 2016 operating results up until the August disposition date. These 2 items amounted to $4.32 of EPS in the quarter and $4.97 for the year. 
If you'll turn to Chart 6, we'll see how our earnings per share in the quarter compare with the EPS from 1 year ago. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.61, which was aided by the $0.27 benefit we described in the prior chart. In addition, the third quarter benefited from improved operating performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment, the lower tax rate and lower share count than in the third quarter of 2015.
On Chart 7, you can see our cash from operations this quarter compared to last year. Cash in the quarter was around $1.3 billion, about $200 million lower than the third quarter of 2015 and continues to be impacted by our decision to fund F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 in excess of the amount of government funding. At the end of the quarter, that exposure was $950 million. While we did receive additional funding for LRIP 9 during the quarter, that funding was not sufficient to match the growth in both LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 expenditures in the quarter, resulting in the increased exposure from the second quarter. We remain hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon but have concerns with receiving collections before year-end as we'll discuss when we show our revised outlook for the year in a few charts.
Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders on a year-to-date basis. With just under $4.5 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and about $600 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow so far this year is around $3.8 billion. With $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.3 billion in shares repurchased to date, we have returned $2.8 billion to stockholders or 73% of free cash flow. And in the third quarter, we increased both our dividend rate and share repurchase authority, as Marillyn highlighted in her comments earlier. 
On Chart 9, you can see the significant reduction in our share count over time, from our peak share count of 456 million shares in 2002, we've reduced shares outstanding to 293 million, 36% less than we had at the peak. And adjusting our previously stated goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, for the 9 million of share reductions from the RMT exchange offer, we expect to achieve the restated goal of 291 million shares by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned. 
Chart 10 provides the updated outlook for the year. On the chart, we have 3 columns. The first shows the outlook we provided during the second quarter call. The middle column shows the same outlook adjusted for the removal of IS&GS results, and the third column shows the revised outlook compared with the middle column. We increased our sales outlook above the high end of the previous guidance to $46.5 billion, and this was driven primarily by higher sales expectations for Aeronautics and Space Systems. Segment operating profit was also increased above the high end of the previous guidance, also driven by Aeronautics and Space Systems. We increased earnings per share from continuing operations to around $12.10, reflecting the strong third quarter results. And we are giving 2 views of cash from operations: One, assuming we do collect billings for the F-35 program before year-end; and one assuming those collections slip into 2017. Assuming we do collect F-35 billings, our cash outlook is greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, a $350 million improvement over the restated second quarter outlook, and this improvement reflects strong cash performance at RMS, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control. If the F-35 collections split into 2017, our outlook for 2016 would be greater than or equal to $5 billion. The $700 million difference in the outlooks would be a digital event at year-end. If it slips out of 2016, 2017 will be $700 million higher. If it does not, 2016 will be $700 million higher, but the total cash between the 2 years will not change. And we'll elaborate more on that in a few charts.
Chart 11 shows our prior sales outlook compared with the current outlook by business area. Compared with the midpoint of our previous guidance, we are increasing our sales outlook by $900 million with Space Systems and Aeronautics driving the change. Space Systems increased due to consolidation of AWE results into our financial statements, while Aeronautics grew due primarily to continued higher-than-expected sales performance on the F-35 program. 
Chart 12 provides the same outlook update for segment operating profit. As with sales, the segment operating profit outlook was driven by increases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. The increase in Aeronautics was driven primarily by the additional F-35 sales volume and improved performance across several programs. The increase in Space Systems was driven by the AWE consolidation gain as well as improved performance in government satellites. 
On Chart 13, we provide our preliminary trends information for 2017. We expect sales to increase around 7% above the 2016 level, with most of the increase coming from Aeronautics' growth driven by F-35 production and sustainment, and Missiles and Fire Control growth driven by higher air missile defense sales. RMS and Space Systems about offset each other next year, with slight growth in RMS being offset by lower sales in Space Systems as the additional AWE volume for a full year in 2017 compared to a partial 2016 is more than offset by lower volume in our government satellite business as well as the absence of any commercial launch activity next year. We expect segment operating margin to range between 10% to 10.5% with the reduction from the 2016 levels driven primarily by a full year of consolidated AWE sales in 2017 without the benefit of the gain in 2016, lower ULA equity earnings due to the mix and volume of launch vehicles expected in 2017 as well as the end of the $40 million annual deferred gain in 2016 and the significant volume increase in F-35 sales at a lower margin rate than the average for the corporation.
Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, again assuming the F-35 collections slide into 2017. We'll provide more color on our longer-term views on cash from operations on the next chart. And we're planning to have at least $2 billion of share repurchases next year, which we expect will further reduce our share count below the 290 million share level. 
Our updated pension outlook assumes a FAS/CAS adjustment of $800 million of income, higher than we discussed during the second quarter call. Interest rates have risen slightly since the last call, and we now see a discount rate of 3.625% rather than the 3.5% we mentioned last quarter. In addition, a new longevity table was published late last week that results in another improvement to the FAS/CAS projection we provided last quarter. 
On the next 2 charts, we provide a longer-term view of both cash from operations and our pension impacts. Beginning with Chart 14 and our longer-term trend for cash from operations, during the third quarter of 2014, we established a goal of generating more than $15 billion of total operating cash for the years 2015 to 2017; significantly higher than prior years as we were expecting what we called a pension funding holiday for that 3-year period. As you can see from the chart, assuming the F-35 collections slip into 2017 and based on our 2-year view of cash for 2016 and 2017, we expect to generate around $15.8 billion over the 3-year time frame, significantly exceeding the 2014 goal. If we look forward to the next 3 years beginning with 2017, we also expect to generate at least $15 billion of total operating cash between 2017 and 2019 with all years at or near $5 billion even after we begin to make required pension contributions in both 2018 and 2019. 
On Chart 15, we provide a view of our expectations for both the FAS/CAS adjustment and cash implications of our pension plan over a longer time frame. All of our projections on this chart assume an 8% return on assets every year and a constant discount rate of 3.625%. As most of you know, we have a significant pre-funding balance that represents the difference between our pension contributions as required by ERISA and the recovery of those contributions via our CAS billings to the government.
At the end of 2016, we expect that pre-fund credit balance to be around $7 billion, and we expect to recover a sizable portion of that $7 billion through the year 2025, which means that our CAS recoveries should exceed required pension contributions in all years through 2025, providing a cash tailwind even during years with required contributions. And as many of you also recall, our pension plan was modified in 2014 in a 2-step process that results in the plan becoming fully frozen at the end of 2019. The first step of the plan modification began in 2016 with the freeze to the salary levels used to calculate pension benefits. This means that between 2017 and 2019, our FAS expense will decrease while our CAS expense increases to recognize the recovery of the pre-fund balance. At the end of 2019, we have the second step of our plan modification, a freezing of the years of service used to calculate pension benefits. And at this point, the plan becomes fully frozen. Beginning in 2020, we will no longer have service accruals for our salaried workforce, and this creates a number of changes to our FAS/CAS adjustment because of the full freeze. We will no longer recognize service cost for the frozen plan, and the amortization period for previous actuarial losses or gains will be extended from roughly 9 years to about 18 years in length. The combination of these changes will likely result in FAS income rather than FAS expense beginning in 2020 as our expected FAS asset returns will exceed the cost elements in our FAS calculation. This means we would expect to have considerable FAS/CAS adjustment income growth between 2017 to 2019 and then see significantly higher FAS/CAS adjustment income beginning in 2020 going forward for the foreseeable future based on current assumptions. 
That leads us to our summary on Chart 16. We had a strong operational and financial -- we had strong operational and financial performance in the quarter and expect to finish the year in a similar fashion. We completed the IS&GS RMT transaction in a manner that was beneficial to the IS&GS business and Lockheed Martin stockholders. The strategic actions we've taken over the past year have strengthened our portfolio and will enable us for future growth. And we have long-term trends and cash from operations and pension impacts that position us to continue to deliver value to our stockholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Andrea?"

I think the latter part of your question was were there risks to the margins. And you should think of at least the near-term margins are really impacted by contracts that were negotiated much prior to LRIPs 9 and 10. So especially 2016 and 2017 has very little, if anything, to do with the margin performance in LRIP 9 and 10. The latter years, obviously, are much greater impacted. We're still looking to have margins on the F-35 program eventually get to mirror or mimic what we've seen in the similar life cycle of the F-16 programs and C-130 programs, and that's still our objective as we sit here today."

I think we're -- we've had a little bit of benefit. We still have -- we haven't talked about it in a while. We still have some remaining options eligible to be exercised, and those options are just proving to be a lot stickier in the past few years than they have been in the years previously. So we're getting some benefit from where we had planned levels of option exercise just coming in lighter than expected. You talked about the $1.8 billion on the Leidos special cash payment, so we've spent most of that through the first 3 quarters. I want to say it's around $400-some-odd million. It's -- I know it's a little less than that as we sit here today. We made the debt retirement of about $0.5 billion in the month of September. And a pretty good chunk of it has gone towards share repurchases and dividends, including the third quarter dividend that we just made. So our expectation is that we will have consumed the full $1.8 billion in capital allocations by the end of the year. And I'm sorry, you asked one other question, Myles, about the 291, was that an average or was that the point estimate at the end of the year? It is the year-end view as far as shares outstanding."

So I think you're pretty close to being right. So I think you should think of the AWE, which I'm not sure if it's organic or inorganic, by the way, but you should think of AWE as contributing about roughly $400 million in sales this year, probably growing to a little over $1 billion, $1.1 billion next year, so maybe $700 million of change, so that's probably a little less than 2%. So we would think that growth organically, as you described it, from year-over-year is probably in the high 4s, maybe a little bit around 5% or so next year. Going forward for the next 3 years or so, we still believe, we kind of talked about in the second quarter call that we think we have growth ranging from about 3% to 5% in the out-years. We still feel good about that. Although it's probably not as steady over those years as you might think, so we have the sort of a bigger uptick that we're expecting in 2017, a lot of that driven by the F-35 program. We see additional growth in 2018 also by F-35, but there's a countervailing issue happening because we have the end of the F-16 production line and the end of C-5 deliveries, both of which occur in 2018. So while we still see growth, organic growth in '18, it will be a little bit diminished because of those 2 events but still better than we've seen for the last few years. And then, frankly, as we sit here today and look at the longer term, 2019 is a higher growth rate than 2018, in part because of the absence of those 2 events."

So you're right. And I think just from conversations that we've had at conferences and with investors as they've toured through Bethesda, there was a lot of misunderstanding perhaps relative to our ability to continue to generate cash flow from operations when we started having pension contributions. So we wanted to tee up that we do think we're going to continue to have strong cash from operations, which is the reason why we came up with a new goal -- essentially the same as the old goal -- for a 3-year period with a common 2017 in both of those 3-year goals. The amount of pension contributions, we have 0 in '17 for all intents and purposes. We have some sort of minor contributions relative to the Sikorsky collective bargaining pension plan, but for all intents and purposes, that's pretty minimal. In 2018 and 2019, it's still a little fluid at this point in time, but you should think of both of those years probably ranging between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of pension contributions. So we are able to essentially mimic what we did with the pension funding holiday because we do expect to have sort of organic, if I could use that term, operational cash growth, and most of that comes from the F-35 program going forward. The Sikorsky business, which we described as sort of treading water for a number of years from a cash flow perspective and then as we finish a lot of the development programs and a couple of the loss programs, frankly, that we have within Sikorsky, we expect to see a return to cash generation. And then the last one is the international growth that we talked about, that Marillyn talked about earlier. So those 3 elements have then sort of everyone else holding constant is contributing mightily towards that level. And then I'll remind you, maybe -- I know you know this, Rich, but while we do make those pension contributions and that's a hit to operating cash, they're also tax deductible, so that's a 35% offset to what we see there as well."

So we got a lot of already booked business that will come in towards those international sales. And so I think our portfolio is really well positioned for growth.

You should think that most of the -- in fact, just the overwhelming majority of the growth in the international business going forward as being FMS or for military sales in nature as opposed to direct commercial sales in nature. And frankly, most of that growth -- think about on programs like the F-35 and the PAC-3 missile and the THAAD air missile defense system, most of those are being negotiated -- even though they're FMS, most of them are being negotiated concurrently with the U.S. government's needs, so I would not expect them to see -- I would not expect to see huge benefits, margin-wise, from the growth we're seeing in international business. Some of that may materialize. We're starting to see sort of pockets of direct commercial sales within that 30%. And to the extent that, that happens, that's usually at a higher margin than the FMS, but not hugely accretive would be my overall take."

I mean, from a PAC-3 standpoint, we do partner with Raytheon on the Patriot systems, so we continue to sell PAC-3s around the world. And we just declared our initial operating capability for the PAC-3 MSE, the Missile Segment Enhancement, which has extended range and greater capabilities. So we're going to have a continued demand for the PAC-3 MSE. I think we'll see countries that will look at buying that greater capability. On THAAD, as we -- it's in the UAE today, of course, and there's a strong pull for THAAD in the Middle East, Qatar and potentially Saudi and others will be looking at THAAD going forward. On Aegis, Aegis we just -- with Korea and Japan. They're adding it to their ships, and we'll have other countries, I think, moving along in that regard. Aegis Ashore, we've set up our Aegis Ashore in Romania, and we see an opportunity in Poland. And then from a competition standpoint, MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, now that Germany has made their selection, we expect other NATO countries to be looking at MEADS and maybe some Middle East countries looking at MEADS as a potential for their capability with its 360-degree capability and really the next generation beyond the Patriot system as the new system. So Poland is still looking at MEADS, for example, and we've had some interest from some Middle East countries on MEADS. And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent is another opportunity for us on growth in missile defense in the U.S. and so not just in the international marketplace, we continue to see growth on the domestic market for our missile defense capabilities. So hopefully, that answers your question. I think over time, the defensive systems that countries need, we expect they will continue to put in place. The threats are not diminishing, they're increasing. And so the defensive systems that we can provide are what we hear from countries around the world that they want, whether it's Japan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or others as I travel around the world, that is a top priority for these countries."

It's not finalized by any stretch of imagination. And none of the numbers that I talked about previously in terms of the growth going forward assume the Bahraini aircraft in the F-16 lines. So right now, it's not in their longer term for the F-16 program as I'd sort of teed up to Noah's question, I think it was relative to the growth going forward. Right now, the F-16 line comes to an end at the end of -- or excuse me, the middle of 2018 or thereabouts. If we were to get the Bahrain order, that would extend it probably another year or so. But you should think that the F-16 program is not going away at all. In fact, if we look at 2017 -- I said '18. I think the line comes to an end in 2017. Excuse me, I spoke a year off there. I think we have 6 aircraft deliveries in 2017. That's the wrap-up of the program from a build cycle versus 12 this year, and yet the sales, the F-16 program are higher next year than they are this year. And in part, that's because we have -- you should think of it of it as 3 large international upgrade programs going on concurrently or pretty much concurrently. We've got the Singaporean, the Taiwanese and a soon-to-be South Korean upgrade of their existing F-16 aircraft, which is actually, as it turns out more than offsetting the production quantity aircraft drop-off next year. So hopefully a little more color there. THAAD, Qatar, we had hoped to close that this year looking towards the end of this calendar year. That's in all likelihood not going to happen. We have it planned and expect to close that in 2017."

So let's see, on the purchase accounting, Sam, I'd say that's a little bit of just sort of housekeeping stuff, nothing hugely dramatic that occurred there, as some of these sorts of adjustments for things like inventory and so forth move around a little bit in part because of the timing of some of the deliveries associated with that inventory and just a better understanding of the business in total. All of the adjustments are required to be done 1 year after the purchase date, which I believe is November 6, so all those are required to be finalized in the fourth quarter. The one benefit that you should see going forward is we are going to have a lightening up, if you will, of the total conforming accounting and purchase accounting adjustments on Sikorsky of about -- I think about $150 million a year or so going forward. So from '16 to '17, that was what was always on the plan. The purchase accounting adjustments that we see happening this year really don't impact that much. You just talked about opportunities relative to the bottoming out in the military -- excuse me, in the commercial marketplace and so forth. We're seeing opportunities pop up. I think Marillyn hit these pretty well in terms of the Polish BLACK HAWK deal, which would be actually built and delivered out of Poland from our facility there, is an interesting opportunity. We have other international opportunities, although they're kind of coming in dribs and drabs, not huge orders, but they're still helping to sort of fill the backlog. As far as the commercial helo market, we don't expect to see that change. In fact, our projections and what we gave in the 7% increase next year essentially says we're flat to maybe a few less than in 2016. And we're hopeful and the numbers, we'd plan suggest that there's a slight uptick in 2018, but nothing huge. So we think this is a fairly slow recovery and not a spike by any stretch of imagination, but nothing between 2016 and 2017."

I mean, it's -- we're going to end the year, next quarter or next -- yes, I'm sorry, we'll -- next quarter and for this year in 2016, at least as we sit here today, it looks pretty similar to what we did from a planned step-up in the fourth quarter versus 2013. We may end the year a little bit light just relative to historical levels, so probably in the lower 30%. I think last year, we did like 34-or-thereabouts percent, but we could have some improvement in the fourth quarter as well. So we'll tell you where we actually ended up at the end of the call in January, but I don't think, back to your original question, see anything systemic there."

Actually, obviously, I did say that. You've got a good memory. I think the wildcard here is when I said that, I didn't expect to have the significant amount of growth on the F-35 program, particularly the sustainment piece of the F-35 program going from 2016 to 2017. I mean it's just amazing the growth that we're seeing on the sustainment program compared to what we previously thought, at least what I previously thought and what I was basing that margin comment on. So the margin at aero will likely be a little bit lighter in 2017 than it was in 2016. And most of that, but maybe not all of that, is driven by the F-35 significant ramp-up and again what I will always call the margin-dilutive algebraic effect of just a lower margin program growing faster than the rest of the business area, and that has dilutive effect on the margins. But as we look forward in the 2018 and I did tee up the C-5 and the F-16. Again, F-16 is not changing total sales volume all that much, although the aircraft quantities are coming down. C-5 is actually, again, a little bit dilutive to the overall margin. But because of the F-35 growth, it's occurring again between '18 and '17. I think the margin's kind of stay fairly constant probably as we look at this time for 2017 and 2018."

So can you just comment on what is causing that and what will it be in the fourth quarter? And on that score, if I just look at your guidance, it implies over $5 billion of revenues in Aeronautics in the fourth quarter, which is usually a strong quarter, but the step-up is much more than what we've seen in the past, so if you could discuss that. And then last, if I look at the $300 million of higher F-35 sales you called out, profit only up $25 million, so 8.3% implied margin. That's a little lower than we've seen in the past.

So F-35 deliveries, I should remind you this is a POC cost-to-cost contract, so the revenue is not impacted by deliveries, but you did make the right observation, George. The deliveries were light -- lighter than the third quarter than we'd otherwise suggest, and this is primarily because and I know you guys have read about this, but we have these insulation tubes that affected a number of our aircraft in the field as well as the aircraft being produced. And while we have the fix for that issue in place, think of this as a supplier-driven item that we had a sort of an out-of-spec delivery that was installed in the aircraft. And as we go through and fix those for the aircraft in the field, we're also going back and fixing the aircraft that are affected with those lines in production, and that is going to cause us to end up a little lighter in F-35 deliveries this year than what we previously had said. We think we know the solution for that, as I said. And we think we recover such that by the end of 2017, we're sort of back on contractual schedule, and hopefully sooner than the end of 2017, but that's the expectation right now. The other thing you talked about was F-35 being greater than $5 billion in the quarter or Aeronautics being greater than $5 billion in the quarter. That is -- that will be the highest quarter, I think, in the history of Aeronautics, but that's sort of tracking, George, to what we expect the annual run rate to look like in 2017. Years ago, we had talked about the Aeronautics business area being about a $20 billion per year revenue business in 2015. It turns out we were close, but that's likely going to happen now in 2017 as opposed to 2015. So that's tracking right with our expectations. And then the last question on the $300 million in sales and the risk retirements, and I think you said 8-point-something percent profit, that's sort of in line with what we've done. We've had quarters previous in this year that were higher, but that's because we had some of the risk retirements that we're talking to Howard about earlier that occurred in previous quarters. When we have those risk retirements, we kind of get a spike in the margin. We just didn't have as many this quarter, so the run rate you're seeing there is about the run rate without risk retirements in the quarter."

So again, we talked about '15 to '17 having a pension holiday, that means we did -- we're not going to make pension contributions; so significant level of sort of pension recovery because of that. Going forward, this is what I was trying to convey in my remarks, while we have pension contributions at the level that you just described, the CAS recovery is also increasing pretty significantly and stays fairly high throughout this entire time frame. And that's again, essentially -- not essentially, but a good chunk of that is recovering that $7 billion of sort of pre-fund credit that we have at the end of this year. So that has to sort of come back at some point in the CAS billings that we have to the government. That's what sustains us over that time, even though the net cash for pension is coming down, the offset is due to operational cash going up."

You should think of those as several hundreds millions of dollars kind of levels between each year there. And that's, again, back to Rob's question, that's one thing that's driving the cash recovery over that period of time. Sikorsky is doing better than we had expected, at least through the first 3 quarters of this year. I think we started off with probably a little more conservative view of Sikorsky, just a little bit of not knowing the business as well as I think we do now. And so we've seen some performance improvements or some risk retirements, I should say, in the third quarter that translate into better performance than we were seeing in the first 2 quarters of the year. I think you also talked about the changes in intangible. And I might have misspoken. I think I was talking about conforming accounting and intangible amortization all rolled up into one. And there's definitely some reductions in some of the conforming accounting adjustments as well as I think one of the things that I teed up in the January call was there was about $30 million or $40 million of sort of severance cost left over in 2016 from a severance action that was taken in the middle of January -- middle of 2015 that does not repeat itself in 2017. That, along with sort of lower integration costs in 2017 compared to 2016, is what's driving the improvements that I talked about."

So the performance -- that you described as performance, I wouldn't necessarily characterize as performance, just the growth in sustainment activity that we see. And why was I surprised or why did I seem like I was surprised? I think, to a certain extent, this is a little bit -- I won't say out of our control entirely, but it is dependent upon when the government establishes sort of the base setups for the induction of F-35 aircraft and what level of support those bases need in order to be ready to take on operational F-35 aircraft. And I'll say we were probably a little conservative or maybe a lot conservative in our forecast as far as thinking that the level of -- if you just think of all the things that have to be at a base, day 1, when you start delivering aircraft to that base and all the alternate mission equipment, all the support equipment and things to pull aircraft around, ladders to get on there, I mean, you could just get on all the stuff that has to go into a base. And I'll say we were probably pretty light on that forecast until we had some of those bases under our belt. And now we have some of those bases under our belt and we have a better understanding of what sort of the average needs are of the aircraft going forward. And so that's what we're projecting going forward, and I think we've got a much better handle on that going forward than we had in the past. That's all good news as far as I'm concerned. Looking forward, you asked about the margin trajectory. I wouldn't expect to see huge swings in margin associated with sustainment. We typically get margins on sustainment and they're kind of negotiated concurrently with the aircraft program. They're kind of negotiated at about similar levels of profitability, so I wouldn't expect to see a swing either way because of production or sustainment. I might remind you that, over time, the development program, the SDD contract is winding down over time. And again, that will end eventually, unless we continue to put development efforts on there, but that's going down next year. That's one of the things that's helping to mitigate some of the Aeronautics loss dilution from the F-35 program."

The underperformance to the 8% has a compounding effect that says you have to have higher CAS contributions going forward, and that's simplistically the reason for the range we're giving today is simply the asset returns. C-130, previous years, we did have some pretty good size pickups or step-ups or risk retirements relative to the third quarter last year, but you're also seeing, as you described it, sort of the lower booking rate on the newly negotiated multiyear contract that has an effect of having a lower profit rate than we've seen in the past years on the C-130 program."
