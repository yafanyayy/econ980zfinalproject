Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 third quarter, which ended on January 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. 
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued, for the first time, a presentation that provides additional details on our revenue performance and, as a result, have reduced our prepared revenue by division commentary in Gary's section. 
Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any on GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. 
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter fiscal year 2015 and all year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak."
31348,326107474,944368,"Medtronic plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2016",2016-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6%, in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted ea",3534,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6%, in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.06, growing at 17% on a comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 1,150 basis points of leverage, significantly above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. 
Our performance in Q3 was solid with sustained execution resulting in another quarter of market outperformance. We continued to deliver on our 3 growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value, which are driving increased diversity of our growth, an important and differentiated attribute of our company. 
Our revenue growth may modestly ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter, indicative of the challenges we are observing in certain businesses or regions as we capitalize on success in others. However, our confidence around the sustainability and consistency of our revenue growth within the mid-single digit range continues to build with each passing quarter. 
In addition, the Covidien integration is delivering robust operating leverage as we realize our committed cost synergies, which, combined with our financial leverage, drove high teens EPS growth and double-digit EPS leverage in Q3. Through FY '18, as we continue to realize cost synergy benefits, we expect to be at the high end of or exceed our EPS leverage goal of 200 to 400 basis points. 
While our operational performance remains strong, we recognize foreign currency translation is still a significant pressure to our bottom line on a reported basis, as it is for most multinational companies of our size and diversity. We are attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs. We also continue to generate significant accessible free cash flow, which we are deploying with discipline, investing for our future while at the same time allocating capital to reduce debt and provide strong returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, our formula for long-term success is to deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth with 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage and a return -- and return a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. The expected net result is creating enormous value, with sustainable double-digit total shareholder returns.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. As we have noted before, we have 3 growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies, new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions, with specific growth expectations for each. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals. 
In therapy innovation, we continue to see strong adoption of our new products and our pipeline remains robust. Our new therapies growth factor accounted for nearly 2/3 of our total company growth, contributing approximately 350 basis points, at the high end of our goal of 150 to 350 basis points. Based on our pipeline and product breadth, we believe performance in the upper half of this range is sustainable over the long term. 
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 7%, we continue to see strong growth in recently launched products that are helping to create important rapidly growing med tech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI safe implantable technology, AF ablation, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. CVG is also seeing highly differentiated new products drive growth in the space business. In drug-eluting stents, our Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity stents are holding share despite major competitive launches. Our position in Europe has been strengthened further by the recent addition of new sizes and indications for Resolute Onyx. In High Power, the Evera MRI ICD that we launched last fall resulted in improved pricing in the U.S. ICD market and a multiyear high share position. 
Looking ahead, we have a number of new products that will continue to differentiate us in the CVG markets and help protect and grow our leadership position. These include our MRI conditional CRT-D devices, which recently received FDA approval and are currently launching in the U.S. and Europe. We also continue to make progress in bringing our Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. and Japan, and a successful FDA advisory panel in this technology 2 weeks ago. 
Our longer-term CVG pipeline is also robust with potentially disruptive therapies like our drug-filled stent, Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve and SYMPLICITY Spyral renal denervation system. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 5%, with Surgical Solutions growing above market and PMR growing at market. Innovative technologies that advance and enhance minimally invasive surgery are driving strong above market growth. Looking ahead, the majority of MITG's growth will come from 5 key growth drivers. 
Within Surgical Solutions, open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal cancer and lung cancer; and within PMR, end-stage renal disease and respiratory complex. Of these, the largest contributor to growth is expected to come from our open strategy, which is focused on sustainable, long-term surgical market leadership by improving open surgery, transitioning open surgeries to MIS and advancing MIS technologies. 
Our recently created new business, Renal Care Solutions, supplemented its breadth with the acquisition of last month. has a full line of therapies and systems for the treatment of renal failure. This combination of with our legacy renal axis business and our internally developed dialysis system offers a complete product solution for End Stage Renal Disease. 
To fuel the global growth drivers that I just mentioned, MITG has a strong product portfolio and expect to launch more than 20 products through end of fiscal year '17, with approximately 75% in Surgical Solutions and approximately 25% in PMR. These new offerings are expected to generate approximately $500 million in cumulative revenue over the next 3 years. 
Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions. 
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 4%, we also have a number of new products driving growth. In Neurovascular, our pipeline Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. Following the 4 clinical trials published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the market continues to adopt our Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy device, a segment of the global ischemic stroke market that we think can triple in size by 2020. 
In Surgical Technologies, we're seeing strong growth from our recently launched O-arm surgical imaging system. 
In Spine, despite posting mid single digit growth in international Core Spine and double-digit growth in U.S. BMP, Q3 results came in below our expectations, primarily because of weakness in U.S. Core Spine. We're focused in executing our turnaround plan in Spine. Our primary focus is growing our market share through calling speed to scale product launches. Speed to scale involves coming to market with a steady cadence of new products as a result of faster innovation cycles and launching these products at scale with sets available for the entire market. These new products will also be combined with enabling technologies, Biologics and targeted physician training at the time of launch. The goal is to constantly innovate procedures such as and improve upon the their outcomes. We have several near-term launches, including accelerated ramps of Voyager and our elevated expandable interbody device, both of which are expected to improve our share in lift procedures, an area where we've been struggling. 
This quarter we will launch , another cervical plate system, the first product in our spine essentials platform. Spine essentials will bring efficiency to the most common spine fusion procedures through more streamlined pre-sterilized sets. 
Additionally, we are further integrating the development roadmaps of our enabling technology with our spine instrumentation, offering a differentiated surgical synergy experience for our customers. And finally, we intend to focus our efforts in gaining share in biographs, utilizing our broad biologics portfolio, including INFUSE. 
With challenges this quarter in our neuromodulation division as well. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused in resolving this matter, our Drug Pump revenue has been effective. We're also facing increased competition in Pain Stim, our recently improved MRI surgical lead is expected to help our competitive position in pain stim as we are the first company to have a complete spinal cord stimulation system approved for full body MRI scans. 
In addition, we continue to market the benefits of our differentiated AdaptiveStim and SureScan MRI technology. And more surgeons are adopting our AdaptiveStim HD high density programming options. 
While they're focused in solving the issues in spine and neuromodulation and our efforts in spine are expected to result in improvement, neuromodulation could be under some pressure for the next several quarters, resulting in overall RTG growth around the low end of the mid-single digit range.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 11%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system in the markets where it is available as well as strong demand for our MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the user's smartphone. We also continue to make excellent progress in bringing the world's first hybrid closed loop system, the MiniMed 670G to market. We expect to complete enrollment in our pivotal trial in the next few weeks with PMA submission to the FDA targeted before the end of June. 
Outside the U.S., we had strong Q3 performance. We were pleased by the positive guidance recently issued by in the United Kingdom, which recommended the MiniMed as the only system for reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business for type 2, our partnership with Henry Schein is a new way and we're already starting to see interest from primary care physicians for our iPro 2 professional CGM system with Pattern Snapshot. 
And services and solutions business, we are preparing to bring our stand-alone CGM system, guardian connect, to market with the PMA submission in the U.S. next week as well as the expected launch in Europe in early FY '17. This product will allow us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone CGM product with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we are well-positioned to provide patients with not just a sensor but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. Overall, we're excited by the progress of our Diabetes business and feel we're well-positioned for sustained growth.
Next, let's discuss our globalization strategy. In G3, emerging markets grew 14% and contributed approximately 190 basis points to our Q3 total company growth, at the upper end of our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We have consistently delivered double-digit growth in emerging markets, despite the fact that several of these markets have faced macro economic pressures. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies in channel optimization and in developing public and private partnerships. We have also benefited from increased geographic diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency of any single market. 
In Q3, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, India and Greater China all grew in the mid to upper teens. In China, we grew 14%, where our strong sales execution and expansion of our multiline selling presence into Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets is resulting in above market growth. We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy, which aims to transition our distribution partnerships to include consolidated logistics platform distributors. We're also developing comprehensive partnerships with provincial governments, Chengdu government in Sichuan province, where we previously announced a partnership to manufacture our hemodialysis equipment. In Q3, we broadened our partnership with Chengdu, agreeing to manufacture our next-generation diabetes pump technology in Chinese language for the local market in Sichuan, while working together with local authorities to expand access for this product. China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Despite the complexities of this market, we have shown that we can grow double digits in China at a sustained basis. We believe China will become our largest healthcare market over the long term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country, and we can never lose sight of this potential. 
In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 19%, driven by the joint venture we formed earlier this year with our largest Saudi distributor as part of our channel optimization strategy in the region. 
In Latin America, we grew 10%, including 7% growth in Brazil. While we continue to outperform the market in Brazil, we do see continued market volume weakness resulting from public spending constraints as well as some difficulty in getting inventory into the country because of customs holds. 
Across emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization like in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, establishing government partnerships in Chengdu and developing private partnerships like the one we established with the last year -- last quarter. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth in these regions and lead to sustained market outperformance. We believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents a single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to economic value growth strategy. Our services and solutions growth factor contributed approximately 20 basis points for Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points revenue growth, our revenue growth was in the mid-30s and contributed 50 basis points to CVG growth where our efforts are most developed. We expect to further improve our growth in services and solutions model expanded across all our business groups. 
In care management services, formerly known as Cardiocom, our growth rate was in the mid-20s in Q3, driven by strong performance within the U.S. Veterans Administration healthcare system, where we are managing a cohort of over 8,500 patients with multiple comorbidities. Care management services represents an important platform for us, especially as postacute care services become even more critical and bundled payment models for different interventions.
In our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating groups, we have service revenue growth rates in the mid-30s. Since the time we started this business a little over 2 years ago, we have now completed a total of 72 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $1.7 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe [ph], we also have 7 hospitals in Latin America and 7 in the Middle East and Africa. We are continuing to attract strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world, and we have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We are pleased with the progress we're making in expanding Hospital Solutions into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products associated expertise. We have signed 5 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of 7 years.
We are also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management through Diabeter, a Netherlands based diabetes clinic and research center we acquired almost a year ago. We continue to grow the number of contracted patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond the Netherlands over time. Through initiatives like Diabeter, as well as others that I mentioned earlier, we are transforming our Diabetes Group from a market-leading pump and sensor business into a holistic diabetes management business.
While all of these service and solutions, care management services, cath lab and operating room management services and Diabeter are still relatively early stage businesses, they represent important future building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where payment will be based in measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon. We are rapidly developing expertise in these areas with a particular focus in supporting bundled solutions across the care continuum, targeting specific patient cohorts requiring a particular intervention. This is consistent with the direction of CMS' bundled payment initiative and their first implementation comprehensive care for joint replacement or CJR, which we fully support. While this initiative is still evolving, it is one that is mandatory, consistent and measurable, which allows us to be scalable. We encourage CMS to expand bundled payments to other clinical areas where we participate more broadly. 
Healthcare is going to a necessary transformation, where stakeholders are seeking not only to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care but are also looking for solutions to optimize cost and efficiency. Our confidence continues to grow in Medtronic's ability to lead and compete in these new value-based health care models around the world. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers. We remain convinced that our technologies and services can play a central role to make the shift to value-based health care successful.
Turning now to the P&L. As I mentioned earlier we delivered EPS leverage of -- in Q3 of 1,150 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year as we deliver on our productivity improvements and cost synergy programs. Operating leverage in the quarter was 510 basis points, driven predominantly by the improvement in SG&A, which is the line item where the majority of the Covidien integration cost synergy that we're realizing today are located. The remainder of our EPS leverage was driven by improvements in our interest expense and taxes [ph] as well as share repurchase activity. 
Our strong revenue growth in operating leverage is generating significant adjusted free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $1.8 billion and expect to generate nearly $40 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the next 5 years. We also continue to look for ways to attract cash in our balance sheet. Last September, we announced that we [indiscernible] $9.3 billion of cash. And last month, we announced how we intend to use these proceeds. We are executing an incremental $5 billion share repurchase that we intend to complete by the end of FY '18. We intend to use the majority of the remaining proceeds to either prepay existing debt or pay debt that comes due by the end of fiscal year 2018 in order to meet our commitments to our debt investors. 
We are deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis even earlier than we had previously announced. 
Regarding share repurchases, with incremental $5 billion share repurchase, we expect to return approximately $15 billion to shareholders over 3 years, more than double the amount we returned over the past 3 years. 
With our M&A investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential opportunities. Any investment we make must meet our portfolio criteria, which are targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes, allowing for Medtronic to add value and they must have a team that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must be aligned with and strengthen 1 or more of our 3 growth strategies, meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. 
Before turning the call over to Gary, I'd like to conclude by commenting briefly on our Covidien integration activities, which continue to go extremely well. We're executing our priorities of preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We have preserved and in many cases accelerated the growth of both companies retention and employee satisfaction remain high as our 2 cultures continue to come together. Our value capture programs are resulting in strong operating leverage. And we have meaningfully improved the sustainability of both our growth through the diversification of our revenue base and our capital allocation goals to increase access [ph] for our cash. 
In summary, Q3 was another quarter of solid execution by our organization. Our operating leverage is coming through as we expected. And I'm pleased with how we are positioning the company to deliver growth consistently and reliably. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary?"

Third quarter revenue of $6,934,000,000 increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes a $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 20 basis points to the Q3 revenue growth. 
Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, a decrease of 1% versus $1.07 delivered by legacy Medtronic last year, or an increase of 17% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.11 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. 
Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.77, a decrease of 21%.
In addition to the $374 million after tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were a $43 million charge for acquisition-related items, a $16 million net restructuring charge and a $25 million benefit resulting from the establishment of a deferred tax asset related to the realization of a onetime capital loss. 
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 7%, with all 3 divisions growing at or above overall company growth. CRHF grew 6% as we took significant share in a flat global implantables market. In high power, our strong Evera MRI launch resulted in our highest U.S. high power shares since early in the decade despite the fact that we had declines in CRT-D. While our CRT-D business experienced sequential growth in U.S. implant share, we also had an intentional reduction in customer inventories, ahead of our Q4 CRT-D MRI launch. 
In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stents share in the face of major competitor data releases and product launches, which we attribute to increasing preference for the Resolute Onyx in Europe and our CVG multiline contracts in U.S. 
In transcatheter valves, we grew in the low 30s, consistent with the market. Market share growth in Europe from the initial launch of CoreValve in Japan in the back half of Q3 balanced modest U.S. share loss where our competitor product launch and a lack of having Evolut R in our largest segment limited total U.S. growth to the mid-20s. 
We were pleased to receive IDE approval for our U.S. low risk trial, and it is worth noting that we now expect the global TAVR market will grow to approximately $4 billion by the end of 2020. 
In Peripheral, we maintained drug-coated balloon market leadership globally and in the U.S. on the strength of our clinically differentiated impact Admirably balloon.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 33% of our total company sales grew revenue 5%, with strong at or above market performance in both divisions. 
In Surgical Solutions, both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy grew in the upper single digits, although we estimate that U.S. surgical volumes have normalized now at 1% to 2%. 
The PMR division grew 1% as the business was affected by a product hold of the Puritan Bennett  980 ventilator, which resulted in an approximate negative $10 million to $15 million impact to the quarter. This is expected to affect quarterly PMR revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million until the product returns to the market, which is expected in the first half of next fiscal year. 
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales grew revenue by 4%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies, offsetting declines in Spine and Neuromodulation. 
In Spine, while U.S. Core Spine was challenge, we gained international Core Spine share. 
In BMP, the U.S. had strong low double-digit growth. However, the ship hold only in Europe is expected to continue through mid FY '17. 
In Neuromodulation, we recently received FDA approval for Parkinson's patients with early onset motor complications, expanding the number of potential patients that can be treated with DBS therapy. 
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of total company sales, grew revenue 11%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions. 
In IIM, our type 1 business, we are seeing very good growth driven by the MiniMed 640G. 
In NDT, our type 2 business, while the revenue base is still small, we're seeing growth over 250% as we continue to drive our iPro 2 Professional CGM solution and the new easy to interpret Pattern Snapshot report into the primary care channel. 
In DSS, our diabetes services and solutions business, we saw high single-digit growth driven by U.S. consumable sales, our Diabeter acquisition and continued strong adoption of our MiniMed Connect remote connectivity platform.
Now turning to the P&L. As I discuss the operating items, it is worth clarifying that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis unless I say otherwise. 
The Q3 operating margin was 29.2%. This represent a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year. But this improvement was completely offset on a reported basis by a negative 140 basis point impact from foreign currency. The 140 basis point operating margin improvement included a 140 basis point improvement in SG&A, offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin, a 10 basis point increase in R&D and a 20 basis point improvement in net other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of over 10% or operating leverage of approximately 510 basis points over revenue growth. 
Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.5% [ph] , SG&A of 33.3% and R&D of 7.6%. Also included in our Q3 operating margin was net other expense of $9 million, which included net currency gains of $78 million, primarily from our earnings hedging program. It is worth noting that included in these net gains was an unexpected $21 million expense resulting from a revaluation of the Argentine peso-denominated assets, which devalued by approximately 30%.
Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include $1.09 euro and a JPY 113 , we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $5 million expense to a $15 million of income, which includes approximately $110 million in currency gains and no longer includes the U.S. medical device tax, which has been suspended. 
We expect our Q4 operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.3% on an as-reported basis based on current exchange rates. This forecast implies an approximate 300 basis point improvement on our operating margin on a constant currency basis. Our value capture programs as a result of the Covidien integration remain on track, and we now expect to exceed our original FY '16 savings goal of $300 million to $350 million and continue to target a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY '18.
Below the operating profit line, Q3 net interest expense was $176 million, in line with our forecast. Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $210 million. This is an increase over prior quarters as the execution of our incremental share repurchases results and reduced interest income. 
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. 
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q3 was 14.3%, which was an improvement from our forecast due to the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit as well as operational tax adjustments. For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%. 
In Q3, adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. 
In Q3, we paid $534 million in dividends and repurchased $710 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,422,000,000 shares. For FY '16, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1,427,000,000 shares, including approximately 1,419,000,000 million shares in Q4. 
Next I would like to comment on our revenue outlook. We expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter of FY '16 to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our prior outlook of second half revenue being in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline goal. This is solid revenue growth, especially when you consider the strong upper single digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year. 
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $180 million to $220 million.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We continue to expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.36 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based in current exchange rates. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during fiscal year. 
Next, I would like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2017. While we intend to provide revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance per our normal practice on our Q4 call, here's some items to keep in mind as you think about our next fiscal year. 
First, on revenue growth. While we are not formally providing our FY '17 revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single digit range on a constant currency basis, consistent with our baseline expectations. However, keep in mind that we had an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY '16. This will negatively affect our Q1 FY '17 revenue growth rate by approximately 600 basis points and our full fiscal year revenue growth rate by approximately 150 basis points and has a commensurate impact to earnings per share. 
Regarding foreign exchange. Given current rates, we expect a $200 [ph] million negative impact in FY '17 revenue and expect it to negatively affect FY '17 earnings per share by approximately $0.20 to $0.25, primarily from the loss of significant hedging gains we had in FY '16 as well as continued pressure from unhedged emerging market currencies. 
Based on the operating leverage from our Covidien integration activities as well as the financial leverage from share repurchases we expect to generate in FY '17, we would expect constant currency earnings per share growth to be double digits to lower teens after adjusting for the extra week in FY '16, which would exceed our baseline goal of generating 200 to 400 basis points of earnings per share leverage. 
Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we plan to hold our Q4 earnings call on May 31. We also plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held in New York City. Omar?"

And as I mentioned in my comments, 510 points on the operating margin line just leverage there and 140 basis point improvement on an operating basis. Unfortunately, with foreign exchange, it's been a headwind all year, it's have a similar negative impact on the margin. And so we didn't get as much of improvement that you might see on an as-reported basis just because of that. So we've been doing all year, we're basically we're continuing to execute our operating leverage plans and our cost takeout synergies that we have from the Covidien transaction. But as with many companies, we're experiencing the foreign exchange mitigating or eliminating a lot of that benefit that we are as we roll through that. We're trying to manage that the best we can, but clearly that's having a big impact. The Covidien synergies, the integration costs were coming right on plan. In fact, as I mentioned in my comments, we're ahead of schedule and we're probably -- we clearly will exceed the $300 million, $350 million that we assumed in the current year. We're seeing a lot of leverage here in Q3 and as we indicated and even in Q4, we'll continue to see improvement in that operating margin as a result of the synergies. So we're right in line with things, but I agree with you, I think FX is kind of camouflaging some of the real benefits you're seeing from an operations perspective."

I think in Surgical Solutions, maybe a slight drop in procedure volumes, but essentially a there was steady no economy related issues. The third aspect was simply our new products. And like I said, these new products will kind of come and go on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And in general, we still had pretty strong performance from new therapies. But in prior quarters, even stronger, even larger kind of set of synergies different products coming in at the same time. I think that's going to go float up and down. And that, I think, is the main factor here in the change in the U.S. market. Which I have to point out that our whole model is based on the diversification because we can't depend on just one market. And as you showed this quarter, emerging markets picked up a little bit and essentially sort of offset the drop in our U.S. revenue.

And the overall cross RTG synergies, what was missing before is we just specific targets on this, that's why we made the changes. We made changes in the field level, we made changes in the overall leadership level and we're looking at this thing closely on a quarter-by-quarter basis and we expect to see improvement.

We try to give some highlights things to consider us to go through the model. But the point is, as we try to highlight here, even for the current year and as we go forward, we are continuing to expect the revenue growth to be in that mid single-digit range as we go forward. We are expecting we're going to continue to get the operating synergies and be at the high end of the in fact exceed probably the earnings growth that we've been expecting from the value capture of the Covidien transaction, and that's going just as we expected. It's coming in, in fact a little bit ahead of the schedule at this point in time. And so we feel confident that would be positive as we go into the next fiscal year, obviously. Foreign exchange continues to be a major headwind for us as it is with the many multinational companies. And ours, because of the hedging programs we did, if anything, if you think about it from a foreign exchange, we had a $0.45 to $0.50 impact from the current year. That was with significant gains that we have from our hedging program. So our impact was somewhat muted maybe where other companies who don't hedge were at. That is going to come to a head for us in FY '17. And as we indicate, that's a potential of another $0.20 to $0.25 of impact as we go into next year. You're right, we're going to have some benefit from the medical device tax. We're getting some already in the current year, that's helping, give us even more operating leverage than what we were expecting previously. But again, the foreign exchange is kind of offsetting it as we kind of drives through this. And so there's positives from the medical device tax, there's going to be positives from our share repurchase. All those are factors we're taking into consideration. But I think if you lay it all together, I think you're going to find a play out like we indicated in our comments because the issue is foreign exchange is clearly still significant headwind for us. And we obviously have a tough comparison next year in FY '17 because of the extra week we have in the current year. Those are all the factors that we try to lay out for you as you put together our models and we'll probably obviously provide more details and more guidance as we get to our Q4 call."

So that's what's caused us to decide in this case to go ahead and do the inventory drawdown during the quarter. In terms of the overall growth of the market, as we said, we think the overall implantables market was relatively flat during the quarter. I'd point out 2 things to keep in mind. One is one of our competitors had an extra few days, extra week in their prior year quarter, which is causing the market to look like it's slower than perhaps it actually is in addition to the fact that we have this drawdown that I just referenced. So if you had it correct for those items, we think the overall market was relatively flat with Low Power growing in low single digits and High Power basically declining in the low single digits. But we've had both now share capture but also price improvements in the standard ICD segment tied to MRI, we would expect to see a similar dynamic play out in the CRT-D segment, which is of course is larger.

In fact I think the last update we gave prior to today would have been around the $3.5 billion market around 2020, 2021. So I'm not quite sure where that comment came from. In terms of overall growth in the quarter, we were quite pleased in fact that we essentially grew with the market in the low 30% range with transcatheter valve'. Obviously, that market growth is quite robust and above the range of estimate that we had given previously of 25% to 30% for FY '16. And in addition, given the fact that we had a major competitive launch into United States during the quarter, we were actually quite pleased that our global transcatheter valve business is essentially splitting the market in terms of the growth rate, growing with the overall market. In terms of the sort of guidance to  a potential $4 billion market that was included in the commentary today, there are a number of moving pieces here. Obviously, we have not seen relative to the intermediate risk group to be noninferior or superior, we obviously is just getting started with the low risk group, so we basically have sort of error bars, if you will, around the range. It's probably between $3.5 billion to $4 billion in terms of a 2021 kind of timeframe. And that's where we sort of landed in the middle on the $4 billion, but I think that will give you a sense of how we're thinking about it today. And obviously, that will evolve as data gets presented on the performance in these patient cohorts."

Pull back and just talk about that for a second, and I'll get into the product i health business. But we do, on a monthly basis, an engagement survey, just to kind of check the polls organization as we go into integration. And happy to say that those results come back very positive. As a matter fact, within MITG the scores are slightly higher even the legacy Medtronic. So being acquired in having a number of changes that are occurring in our business and still having those scores come back engagement perspective that high gives me confidence that we're going to have a retention key talent, which we're working very hard to do and are committed to that the armament the. So I think that's probably first and foremost in my opinion the most important thing. Second of that, it's a number of nice things coming from our surgical business. I referenced in the prepared document that we have greater than 20 products across MITG being launched that will drive close to $0.5 billion in revenue over the next 3 years or so. So we have a very healthy portfolio products. Just a couple that I'll call out that you'll see again in SAGES would be new generators that we have in our Advanced Energy line. One of them would be a next-generation force tried generator that will focus on that or speed to seal the. And also provide the capability to drive new, that's the most important thing about that generator. It will give us the to the capability to drive instruments of that will be a little more unique in the marketplace. I'll talk about one of those in a second. We also have a generator that we are launching that is specifically for emerging markets, take that think of ability and ligature and provide a lower-cost generator so we can get access to those markets as well. That actually launched a quarter ago. And then one of the new instruments that I mentioned in Energy will be multifunction device, and this is important because what you're looking for in the perfect world in Advanced Energy is to be able to divide tissue either organs or vessels that you're trying to take and you want to do that typically with a product that divides well or cuts well. But at the same time, you'd like to use that instrument for sealing. And it's one of these products that we're going to be launching talking about SAGES will both of those very well. That's been allusive or anybody in the market place and we think we can figure it out in the were going to talk about in stages. And then we have a couple of items in statement, net next-generation power Stapling that's coming. We're getting great reviews from customers. And again, most important thing about the power Stapling is it is a driver for our in defectors with utilizing stable technology. So this is just a few things coming in the short term. And then of course in the midterm, we talk about our products platform or give you a little more insight in SAGES and I want to because us to give you anything specifics on when we're going to launch, but let's just say midterm we're excited about that project as well."

Thanks, Kristen. First of all, on the businesses like Neurovascular, in particular, and our Surgical Technologies business, the ENT business, the Advanced Energy business, we want to ensure there was continue to perform and we feel very good about where they stand in terms of their new product launches and new clinical data that they all have coming out. So very excited about that. Spine, obviously a lot of questions on even on this call regarding Spine. That's a multi kind of fully first answer is the turnaround there, we've been having steady quarter-over-quarter growth over the last couple of quarters. This quarter was a little bit of a step back in the U.S., and we anticipate returning to growth next quarter and a continued steady cadence of improvement. And it's really -- there's a couple of things. One, as Omar mentioned, our Core Spine portfolio, we are excited about the products. Our upstream marketing has done a good job building a number of new products, and now we're focused on the downstream commercial execution and the launch of those products. And just this quarter, we have several new ones for lumbar Fusion just fixation system and elevated extendable cage. And the one I'm particularly excited about is the oldest procedure, which we think based on the physician feedback we're getting is going to be fairly disruptive to the space. And so we have a number of those new product launches and the big change is launching them in scale, so making sure we have the right amount of sets and inventory to launch them at scale, which is a change. The other component here is our biologic portfolio, which infuse is the biggest piece. That can be used to rebound and we continue to get we just got our recent indication for that a lift procedure I just mentioned and we're working on other indications there for INFUSE and our broader Biologics per folder. And then finally, Omar engine Surgical Synergy. A little bit of a more new view on this one. First of all, when people look at our overall RTG performance, the Spine business dramatically helps our surgical technology business. Our navigation, that business has been about high single-digit, low double-digit growth platform for the last couple of years powered by navigation and the imaging platform. Without Spine, we wouldn't have that type of growth, full stop. But what we need to do is move further upstream and have a tighter technology integration between those 2 units so that our customers feel a differentiated Surgical Synergy experience. And then finally, we are hiring what we're calling ATC reps. These are enabling technology consultants that are really driving the penetration on the ground with the physicians for navigated spine procedures. So it's a number of different things. And look, this is going to be a steady climb back. We're pretty excited about the next 2 quarters, actually, regarding Spine. And then getting back to overall RTG that place that we have the, I think, the most weakness actually is Spine because it's moving is neuromodulation. Our weakness in pain stim and pain pumps, partially driven by the consent decree for pumps and competition for stem, that's offsetting our growth in the DBS and neuro, and that's going to take a few quarters to work through those dynamics."

But as we've tried to highlight in our comments, obviously, the revenue growth we would expect to continue in the mid-single-digit revenue range as we talked about. Clearly, we're going to get a significant operating leverage improvement from the earnings standpoint on a constant currency basis because of the value capture we're taking out, because of the medical device tax, benefit and how much of that is reinvested and not reinvested will come into play as we go through that whole discussion. And obviously, as you indicate, there'll be share buybacks benefits that will be reflected in those numbers. And that's why we indicated that on a constant currency basis, we would expect that we're going to be in the low double-digit to mid-teens earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis if you just take all those factors into consideration. That's after taking out the extra week and you're just comparing apples-to-apples. And as a result of that, then you have the FX impact coming into play. So all we're trying to highlight to people is your assumptions going forward on our leverage assumptions, et cetera, are consistent with what we've been saying. But just remember FX has not went away and just remember that we had an extra week in the current year. So other than that, I won't give you more on the guidance aspect.

So that was the primary thing. So FX was a bigger negative on the bottom line in the quarter than what we had originally expected at the beginning of the quarter.

So we feel confident about that, assuming again that there is no surprises, positive or negative. So that's all the best we can do at this point in time, is to give you some indication on which direction these things are going. But let me just add one comment, the key element I want to make clear is the thing that we can control. The cost takeout, the synergies that are getting from the standpoint of the Covidien transaction and the leverage we're getting across the rest of the organization, that's the piece that we can control, and that is going right as expected, is in fact ahead of our plans as I mentioned in our previous comments.

As I've said even since I started here, we can work on things that we can control. While we accept other variables and we try to understand completely the valuation of the company based on the actual performance, we can only kind of drive what we can control as best we can, meet our commitments and drive aggressively as we can. And that we are completely committed to doing. And on that basis, as Gary just pointed out, the cost synergies that we expect from Covidien, we've got pretty granular look at that, we're delivering. We're delivering, this operating team is delivering and they're stretching hard and trying to cover for other things. But there's only so far we can go about things that are not in our control. 
So I just do want to make that point that we haven't lost our operational focus on delivering the synergies one bit and, in many ways, are a little bit ahead of our original I'll commitments. But there's a lot of moving parts there. And we are optimistic about the future and our plans are pretty solid going into fourth quarter and into next year. 
But listen, let me go back to long-term and really conclude by noting that our overall long term financial model. Let me remind you what it is, it's consistent mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a reliable basis, which we will get through the diversification of our businesses as well as geographies and our new product cadence. 200 to 400 basis points of constant currency EPS leverage over the long term, and some of that may be a little higher in the next couple of years as we realize all the synergies from the Covidien acquisition as we saw this quarter. And then finally, returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders. That again is a commitment that we are completely living up to, and we expect to see that fulfilled in the upcoming quarters.
Stepping back even further, look, this company is geared around fulfilling our mission, restoring health and extending life, and that mission continues. We're confident that this team can execute consistently, balancing our trade-offs and offsetting pressures. And in the end, we're committed to creating long-term dependable value in health care.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued, for the first time, a presentation that provides additional details on our revenue performance and, as a result, have reduced our prepared revenue by division commentary in Gary's section.
Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. 
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 and all year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak."
31348,326107474,944636,"Medtronic plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2016",2016-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6%, in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted ea",3567,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6%, in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.06, growing at 17% on a comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 1,150 basis points of leverage, significantly above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points.
Our performance in Q3 was solid, with sustained execution resulting in another quarter of market outperformance. We continued to deliver on our 3 growth strategies: therapy innovation; globalization; and economic value, which are driving increased diversity of our growth, an important and differentiated attribute of our company.
Our revenue growth may modestly ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter, indicative of the challenges we are observing in certain businesses or regions as we capitalize on success in others. However, our confidence around the sustainability and consistency of our revenue growth within the mid-single digit range continues to build with each passing quarter.
In addition, the Covidien integration is delivering robust operating leverage as we realize our committed cost synergies, which combined with our financial leverage, drove high-teens EPS growth and double-digit EPS leverage in Q3. Through FY '18, as we continue to realize cost synergy benefits, we expect to be at the high end of or exceed our EPS leverage goal of 200 to 400 basis points.
While our operational performance remains strong, we recognize foreign currency translation is still a significant pressure to our bottom line on a reported basis, as it is for most multinational companies of our size and diversity. We are attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs. We also continue to generate significant accessible free cash flow, which we are deploying with discipline, investing for our future while at the same time allocating capital to reduce debt and provide strong returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, our formula for long-term success is to deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth with 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage and a return -- and return a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. The expected net result is creating enormous value, with sustainable double-digit total shareholder returns.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. As we have noted before, we have 3 growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: new therapies; emerging markets; and services and solutions, with specific growth expectations for each. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals.
In therapy innovation, we continue to see strong adoption of our new product and our pipeline remains robust. Our new therapies growth factor accounted for nearly 2/3 of our total company growth, contributing approximately 350 basis points, at the high end of our goal of 150 to 350 basis points. Based on our pipeline and product breadth, we believe performance in the upper half of this range is sustainable over the long term.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 7%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important rapidly growing med tech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI safe implantable technology, AF ablation, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. CVG is also seeing highly-differentiated new products drive growth in the space businesses. 
In drug-eluting stents, our Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity stents are holding share despite major competitive launches. Our position in Europe has been strengthened further by the recent addition of new sizes and indications for Resolute Onyx. In High Power, the Evera MRI ICD that we launched last fall resulted in improved pricing in the U.S. ICD market and a multiyear high share position.
Looking ahead, we have a number of new products that will continue to differentiate us in the CVG market and help protect and grow our leadership position. These include our MRI conditional CRT-D devices, which recently received FDA approval and are currently launching in the U.S. and Europe. We also continued to make progress in bringing our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. and Japan, and we had a successful FDA advisory panel on this technology 2 weeks ago.
Our longer-term CVG pipeline is also robust with potentially disruptive therapies like our drug-filled stent, Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve and SYMPLICITY Spyral renal denervation system.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 5%, with Surgical Solutions growing above market and PMR growing at market. Innovative technologies that advance and enhance minimally invasive surgery are driving strong above market growth. Looking ahead, the majority of MITG's growth will come from 5 key growth drivers.
Within Surgical Solutions, open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal cancer and lung cancer; and within PMR, end-stage renal disease and respiratory compromise. [ph] Of these, the largest contributor to growth is expected to come from our open to MIS strategy, which is focused on sustainable, long-term surgical market leadership by improving open surgery, transitioning open surgeries through MIS and advancing MIS technologies.
Our recently created new business, Renal Care Solutions, supplemented its breadth with the acquisition of Bellco last month. Bellco has a full line of therapies and systems for the treatment of renal failure. This combination of Bellco with our legacy renal axis business and our internally developed portable dialysis system offers a complete product solution for End Stage Renal Disease.
To fuel the global growth drivers that I just mentioned, MITG has a strong product portfolio and expect to launch more than 20 products through the end of fiscal year '17, with approximately 75% in Surgical Solutions and approximately 25% in PMR. These new offerings are expected to generate approximately $500 million in cumulative revenue over the next 3 years.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 4%, we also have a number of new products driving growth. In Neurovascular, our Pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. Following the 4 clinical trials published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the market continues to adopt our Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy device, a segment of the global ischemic stroke market that we think can triple in size by 2020.
In Surgical Technologies, we're seeing strong growth from our recently launched O-arm surgical imaging system.
In Spine, despite posting mid-single-digit growth in international Core Spine and double-digit growth in U.S. BMP, Q3 results came in below our expectations, primarily because of weakness in U.S. Core Spine. We're focused on executing our turnaround plan in Spine. Our primary focus is growing our market share to, what we're calling, Speed to Scale product launches. Speed to Scale involves coming to market with a steady cadence of new products as a result of faster innovation cycles and launching these products at scale, with sets available for the entire market. These new products will also be combined with enabling technologies, Biologics and targeted physician training at the time of launch. The goal is to constantly innovate procedures such as OLIF and TLIF [ph] and improve upon their outcomes. We have several near-term launches, including accelerated ramps of Solera Voyager and our elevate -- expandable interbody device, both of which are expected to improve our share in TLIF procedures, an area where we've been struggling. 
This quarter we will launch ATLANTIS ESSENTIALS, another cervical plate system, the first product in our spine essentials platform. Spine essentials will bring efficiency to the most common spine fusion procedures through more streamlined pre-sterilized sets.
Additionally, we are further integrating the development roadmaps of our enabling technology with our spine instrumentation, offering a differentiated surgical synergy experience for our customers. And finally, we intend to focus our efforts in gaining share in biographs, utilizing our broad biologics portfolio, including INFUSE.
With challenges this quarter in our neuromodulation division as well. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused on resolving this matter, our Drug Pump revenue has been effective. We're also facing increased competition in Pain Stim, our recently improved MRI surgical lead is expected to help our competitive position in Pain Stim as we are the first company to have a complete spinal cord stimulation system approved for full body MRI scans. 
In addition, we continue to market the benefits of our differentiated AdaptiveStim and SureScan MRI technology. And more surgeons are adopting our AdaptiveStim HD high density programming options. 
While we're focused in solving the issues in spine and neuromodulation and our efforts in spine are expected to result in steady [ph] improvement, neuromodulation could be under some pressure for the next several quarters, resulting in overall RTG growth around the low-end of the mid-single-digit range.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 11%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system in the markets where it is available as well as strong demand for our MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the user's smartphone. We also continue to make an excellent progress in bringing the world's first hybrid closed loop system, the MiniMed 670G to market. We expect to complete enrollment in our pivotal trial in the next few weeks with PMA submission to the FDA targeted before the end of June.
Outside the U.S., we had strong Q3 performance. We were pleased by the positive guidance recently issued by NICE in the United Kingdom, which recommended the MiniMed Paradigm Veo as the only system for reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business for type 2, our partnership with Henry Schein is under way and we're already starting to see interest from primary care physicians for our iPro 2 professional CGM system with Pattern Snapshot.
In our Diabetes Services and Solutions business, we are preparing to bring our stand-alone CGM system, Guardian Connect, to market for the PMA submission in the U.S. next week as well as expected launch in Europe in early FY '17. This product will allow us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone CGM product with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we are well-positioned to provide patients with not just a sensor but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. Overall, we're excited by the progress of our Diabetes business and feel we're well-positioned for sustained growth.
Next, let's discuss our globalization strategy. In Q3, emerging markets grew 14% and contributed approximately 190 basis points to our Q3 total company growth, at the upper end of our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We have consistently delivered double-digit growth in emerging markets, despite the fact that several of these markets have faced macroeconomic pressures. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies in channel optimization and in developing public and private partnerships. We have also benefited from increased geographic diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency of any single market.
In Q3, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, India and Greater China all grew in the mid- to upper teens. In China, we grew 14%, where our strong sales execution and expansion of our multiline selling presence into Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets is resulting in above market growth. We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy, which aims to transition our distribution partnerships to include consolidated logistics platform distributors. We're also developing comprehensive partnerships with provincial governments, like that with the Chengdu government in Sichuan province, where we previously announced a partnership to manufacture our portable hemodialysis equipment. In Q3, we broadened our partnership with Chengdu, agreeing to manufacture our next-generation diabetes pump technology in Chinese language for the local market in Sichuan, while working together with local authorities to expand access for this product. China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Despite the complexities of this market, we have shown that we can grow double digits in China on a sustained basis. We believe China will become our largest healthcare market over the long term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country, and we can never lose sight of this potential.
In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 19%, driven by the joint venture we formed earlier this year with our largest Saudi distributor as part of our channel optimization strategy in the region.
In Latin America, we grew 10%, including 7% growth in Brazil. While we continue to outperform the market in Brazil, we do see continued market volume weakness resulting from public spending constraints as well as some difficulty in getting inventory into the country because of customs holds.
Across the emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization like in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, establishing government partnerships in Chengdu and developing private partnerships like the one we established with the Abraaj Group last year -- last quarter. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth in these regions and lead to sustained market outperformance. We believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents a single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to economic value growth strategy. Our services and solutions growth factor contributed approximately 20 basis points for Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points revenue growth, our revenue growth was in the mid-30s and contributed 50 basis points to CVG growth where our efforts are most developed. We expect to further improve our growth in services and solutions model and expanded across all our business groups.
In care management services, formerly known as Cardiocom, our growth rate was in the mid-20s in Q3, driven by strong performance within the U.S. Veterans Administration healthcare system, where we are managing a cohort of over 8,500 patients with multiple comorbidities. Care management services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical and bundle payment models for different interventions.
In our Hospital Solutions business, through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth rates in the mid-30s. Since the time we started this business a little over 2 years ago, we have now completed a total of 72 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $1.7 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have 7 hospitals in Latin America and 7 in the Middle East and Africa. We are continuing to attract strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world, and we have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We are pleased with the progress we're making in expanding Hospital Solutions into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products associated expertise. We have signed 5 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of 7 years.
We are also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management through Diabeter, a Netherlands based diabetes clinic and research center we acquired almost a year ago. We continue to grow the number of contracted patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond the Netherlands over time. Through initiatives like Diabeter, as well as others that I mentioned earlier, we are transforming our Diabetes Group from a market-leading pump and sensor business into a holistic diabetes management business.
While all of these service and solutions, care management services, cath lab and operating room management services and Diabeter are still relatively early stage businesses, they represent important future building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where payment will be based in measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon. We are rapidly developing expertise in these areas with a particular focus in supporting bundled solutions across the care continuum, targeting specific patient cohorts requiring a particular intervention. This is consistent with the direction of CMS' bundled payment initiative and their first implementation comprehensive care for joint replacement or CJR, which we fully support. While this initiative is still evolving, it is one that is mandatory, consistent and measurable, which allows it to be scalable. We encourage CMS to expand bundled payments to other clinical areas where we participate more broadly. 
Healthcare is going to a necessary transformation, where stakeholders are seeking not only to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care but are also looking for solutions to optimize cost and efficiency. Our confidence continues to grow in Medtronic's ability to lead and compete in these new value-based health care models around the world. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers. We remain convinced that our technologies and services can play a central role to make the shift to value-based health care successful.
Turning now to the P&L. As I mentioned earlier we delivered EPS leverage of -- in Q3 of 1,150 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, as we deliver on our productivity improvements and cost synergy programs. Operating leverage in the quarter was 510 basis points, driven predominantly by the improvement in SG&A, which is the line item where the majority of the Covidien integration cost synergies that we're realizing today are located. The remainder of our EPS leverage was driven by improvements in our interest expense and taxes [ph] as well as share repurchase activity.
Our strong revenue growth in operating leverage is generating significant adjusted free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $1.8 billion and expect to generate nearly $40 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the next 5 years. We also continue to look for ways to attract cash in our balance sheet. Last September, we announced that we had entrapped  [ph] $9.3 billion of cash. And last month, we announced how we intend to use these proceeds. We are executing an incremental $5 billion share repurchase that we intend to complete by the end of FY '18. We intend to use a majority of the remaining proceeds to either prepay existing debt or pay debt that comes due by the end of fiscal year 2018 in order to meet our commitments to our debt investors.
We are deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis even earlier than we had previously announced. 
Regarding share repurchases, with incremental $5 billion share repurchase, we expect to return approximately $15 billion to shareholders over 3 years, more than double the amount we returned over the past 3 years. 
With our M&A investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential opportunities. Any investment we make must meet our portfolio criteria, which are: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes; allowing for Medtronic to add value; and we must have a team that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must be aligned with and strengthen 1 or more of our 3 growth strategies, meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution.
Before turning the call over to Gary, I'd like to conclude by commenting briefly on our Covidien integration activities, which continue to go extremely well. We're executing on our priorities of preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We have preserved and in many cases accelerated the growth of both companies talent retention and employee satisfaction remain high as our 2 cultures continue to come together. Our value capture programs are resulting in strong operating leverage. And we have meaningfully improved the sustainability of both our growth through the diversification of our revenue base and our capital allocation goals to increased access to our cash.
In summary, Q3 was another quarter of solid execution by our organization. Our operating leverage is coming through as we expected. And I'm pleased with how we are positioning the company to deliver growth consistently and reliably. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary?"

Third quarter revenue of $6,934,000,000 increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes a $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 20 basis points to the Q3 revenue growth. 
Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, a decrease of 1% versus $1.07 delivered by legacy Medtronic last year, or an increase of 17% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.11 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation.
Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.77, a decrease of 21%.
In addition to the $374 million after tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were a $43 million charge for acquisition-related items, a $16 million net restructuring charge and a $25 million benefit resulting from the establishment of a deferred tax asset related to the realization of a onetime capital loss.
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 7%, with all 3 divisions growing at or above overall company growth. CRHF grew 6% as we took significant share in a flat global implantables market. In high power, our strong Evera MRI launch resulted in our highest U.S. high power shares, since early in the decade, despite the fact that we had declines in CRT-D. While our CRT-D business experienced sequential growth in U.S. implant share, we also had an intentional reduction in customer inventories, ahead of our Q4 CRT-D MRI launch.
In Coronary, we are holding global diluted earnings drug-eluting stents share in the face of major competitor data releases and product launches, which we attribute to increasing preference for the Resolute Onyx in Europe and our CVG multiline contracts in U.S. 
In transcatheter valves, we grew in the low 30s, consistent with the market. Market share growth in Europe from the initial launch of CoreValve in Japan in the back half of Q3 balanced modest U.S. share loss where our competitor product launch and a lack of having Evolut R in our largest TAVR [ph] segment limited total U.S. growth to the mid-20s. 
We were pleased to receive IDE approval for our U.S. low-risk trial, and it is worth noting that we now expect the global TAVR market will grow to approximately $4 billion by the end of 2020. 
In Peripheral, we maintained drug-coated balloon market leadership globally and in the U.S. on the strength of our clinically differentiated impact Admiral balloon.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 33% of our total company sales grew revenue 5%, with strong at or above market performance in both divisions. 
In Surgical Solutions, both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy grew in the upper-single digits, although we estimate that U.S. surgical volumes have normalized now at 1% to 2%.
The PMR division grew 1%, as the business was affected by a product hold of the Puritan Bennett  980 ventilator, which resulted in an approximate negative $10 million to $15 million impact to the quarter. This is expected to affect quarterly PMR revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million until the product returns to the market, which is expected in the first half of next fiscal year.
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales grew revenue by 4%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies, offsetting declines in Spine and Neuromodulation.
In Spine, while U.S. Core Spine was challenge, we gained international Core Spine share.
In BMP, the U.S. had strong low double-digit growth. However, InductOs ship hold [ph] in Europe is expected to continue through mid-FY '17.
In Neuromodulation, we recently received FDA approval for Parkinson's patients with early onset motor complications, expanding the number of potential patients that can be treated with DBS therapy.
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of total company sales, grew revenue 11%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions.
In IIM, our type 1 business, we are seeing very good growth driven by the MiniMed 640G. 
In NDT, our type 2 business, while the revenue base is still small, we're seeing growth over 250% as we continue to drive our iPro 2 Professional CGM solution and the new easy-to-interpret Pattern Snapshot report into the primary care channel.
In DSS, our diabetes services and solutions business, we saw high single-digit growth driven by U.S. consumable sales, our Diabeter acquisition and continued strong adoption of our MiniMed Connect remote connectivity platform.
Now turning to the P&L. As I discussed the operating items, it is worth clarifying that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis, unless I say otherwise. 
The Q3 operating margin was 29.2%. This represents a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year. But this improvement was completely offset on a reported basis by a negative 140 basis point impact from foreign currency. The 140 basis point operating margin improvement included a 140 basis point improvement in SG&A, offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin, a 10 basis point increase in R&D and a 20 basis point improvement in net other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of over 10% or operating leverage of approximately 510 basis points over revenue growth.
Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.5%, SG&A of 33.3% and R&D of 7.6%. Also included in our Q3 operating margin was net other expense of $9 million, which included net currency gains of $78 million, primarily from our earnings hedging program. It is worth noting that included in these net gains was an unexpected $21 million expense resulting from a revaluation of the Argentine peso-denominated assets, which devalued by approximately 30%.
Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include $1.09 euro [ph] and a JPY 113 , we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $5 million expense to a $15 million of income, which includes approximately $110 million in currency gains and no longer includes the U.S. medical device tax, which has been suspended.
We expect our Q4 operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.3% on an as-reported basis based on current exchange rates. This forecast implies an approximate 300 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a constant currency basis.
Our value capture programs as a result of the Covidien integration remain on track, and we now expect to exceed our original FY '16 savings goal of $300 million to $350 million and continue to target a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY '18.
Below the operating profit line, Q3 net interest expense was $176 million, in line with our forecast. Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $210 million. This is an increase over prior quarters as the execution of our incremental share repurchases results and reduced interest income.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q3 was 14.3%, which was an improvement from our forecast due to the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit as well as operational tax adjustments. For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%.
In Q3, adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile.
In Q3, we paid $534 million in dividends and repurchased $710 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,422,000,000 shares. For FY '16, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1,427,000,000 shares, including approximately 1,419,000,000 million shares in Q4. 
Next I would like to comment on our revenue outlook. We expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter of FY '16 to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our prior outlook of second half revenue being in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline goal. This is solid revenue growth, especially when you consider the strong upper single-digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year.
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $180 million to $220 million.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We continue to expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.36 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during fiscal year.
Next, I would like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2017. While we intend to provide revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance per our normal practice on our Q4 call, here's some items to keep in mind as you think about our next fiscal year. 
First, on revenue growth. While we are not formally providing our FY '17 net revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis, consistent with our baseline expectations. However, keep in mind that we had an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY '16. This will negatively affect our Q1 FY '17 revenue growth rate by approximately 600 basis points and our full fiscal year revenue growth rate by approximately 150 basis points and has a commensurate impact to earnings per share. 
Regarding foreign exchange. Given current rates, we expect a few hundred million dollar negative impact in FY '17 revenue and expect it to negatively affect FY '17 earnings per share by approximately $0.20 to $0.25, primarily from the loss of significant hedging gains we had in FY '16 as well as continued pressure from unhedged emerging market currencies.
Based on the operating leverage from our Covidien integration activities as well as the financial leverage from share repurchases we expect to generate in FY '17, we would expect constant currency earnings per share growth to be double digits to lower teens after adjusting for the extra week in FY '16, which would exceed our baseline goal of generating 200 to 400 basis points of earnings per share leverage.
Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we plan to hold our Q4 earnings call on May 31. We also plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held in New York City. Omar?"

And as I mentioned in my comments, 510 points on the operating margin line just of leverage there and 140 basis point improvement on an operating basis. Unfortunately, with foreign exchange, it's been a headwind all year. It's having a similar negative impact on the margin. And so we didn't get as much of improvement than we might see on an as-reported basis just because of that. So we've been doing all year. We're basically we're continuing to execute against our operating leverage plans and our cost takeout synergies that we have from the Covidien transaction. But as with many companies, we're experiencing the foreign exchange debt mitigating or eliminating a lot of that benefit that we are as we roll through that. We're trying to manage that as best we can, but clearly that's having a big impact. The Covidien synergies, the integration costs we're coming right on plan. In fact, as I mentioned in my comments, we're ahead of schedule and we're probably -- we clearly will exceed the $300 million, $350 million that we assumed in the current year. We're seeing a lot of leverage here in Q3 and as we had indicated and even in Q4, we'll continue to see improvement in that operating margin as a result of the synergies. So we're right in line with things, but I agree with you, I think FX is kind of camouflaging some of the real benefits you're seeing from an operations perspective."

But in prior quarters, which was even stronger, even larger kind of set of synergies, different products coming in at the same time. I think that's going to go float up and down. And that, I think, is the main factor here in the change in the U.S. market. But I have to point out that our whole model is based on the diversification because we can't depend on just one market.

We tried to give some highlights of some things just to consider as you go through the model.

We are expecting we're going to continue to get the operating synergies and be at the high-end of the and in fact exceed probably the earnings growth that we've been expecting from the value capture of the Covidien transaction, and that's going just as we expected. It's coming in, in fact a little bit ahead of the schedule at this point in time. And so we feel confident that will be positive as we go into the next fiscal year, obviously. Foreign exchange continues to be a major headwind for us as it is with many multinational companies. And ours, because of the hedging programs we did, if anything, if you think about it from a foreign exchange, we had a $0.45 to $0.50 impact from the current year. Well, that was with significant gains that we had from our hedging program. So our impact was somewhat muted from maybe where other companies who don't hedge were at. That is going to come to a head for us in FY '17. And as we indicate, that's a potential of another $0.20 to $0.25 of impact as we go into next year. You're right, we're going to have some benefit from the medical device tax. We're getting some already in the current year, that's helping, give us even more operating leverage than what we were expecting previously. But again, the foreign exchange is kind of offsetting it as we kind of drive through this. And so there is positives from the medical device tax, there's been positives from our share repurchase. All those are factors we're taking into consideration. But, I think, if you lay all those together, I think, you're going to find that they play out like we've indicated in our comments because -- but the issue with foreign exchange is clearly is still a significant headwind for us.

One is, one of our competitors had an extra few days, extra week in their prior year quarter, which is causing the market to look like it's slower than perhaps it actually is in addition to the fact that we have this drawdown that I just referenced. So if you had it correct for those items, we think the overall market was relatively flat with Low Power growing in low single digits and High Power basically declining in the low single digits.

In terms of the sort of guidance to a potential $4 billion market that was included in the commentary today, there are a number of moving pieces here. Obviously, we have not seen relative to the intermediate risk group to [indiscernible] to be noninferior or superior, we obviously are just getting started with the low risk group, so we're basically have sort of error bars, if you will, around the range. It's probably between $3.5 billion to $4 billion in terms of a 2021 kind of timeframe. And that's where we sort of landed in the middle on the $4 billion, but I think that will give you a sense of how we're thinking about it today. And obviously, that will evolve as data gets presented on the performance in these patient cohorts."

Pull back and just talk about that for a second, and then I'll get into the products and health business. But we do, on a monthly basis, an employee engagement survey, just to kind of check the polls for the organization as we are going through the integration. And happy to say that those results come back very positive. As a matter fact, within MITG, the scores are slightly higher even in legacy Medtronic. And so being acquired and having a number of changes that are occurring in our business and still having those scores come back engagement perspective that high gives me confidence that we're going to have a retention of key talent, which we're working very hard to do and we're going to continue our momentum. So I think that's probably first and foremost in my opinion the most important thing. Second to that, let's say, just you're going to see a number of nice things coming from our surgical business. I referenced in the prepared document that we have greater than 20 products across MITG being launched that will drive close to $0.5 billion in revenue over the next 3 years or so. So we have a very healthy portfolio of products. Just a couple that I'll call out that you'll see again in SAGES would be new generators that we have in our Advanced Energy line. One of them would be a next-generation ForceTriad generator that will focus on better speed to seal. And also provide the capability to drive new LigaSure instruments not the most important thing about that generator. It will give us the capability to drive instruments that will be a little more unique in the marketplace. And I'll talk about one of those in a second. We also have a generator that we are launching that is specifically for emerging markets, got to take that same capability in LigaSure and provide a lower cost generator so we can get access to those markets as well. That actually launched a quarter ago. And then one of the new instruments that I mentioned in Energy will be a multifunction device. And this is important because what you're looking for in the perfect world in Advanced Energy is to be able to divide tissue [indiscernible] either organs or vessels that you're trying to take and you want to do that typically with a product that divides well or cuts well. But at the same time, you'd like to use that instrument for sealing. And it's one of these products that we're going to be launching and talking about at SAGES we'll both of those very well. This has been elusive for everybody in the marketplace to get it done and we think we figured it out and we're going to talk about that at SAGES. And then we have a couple of items in stapling. We've got our next-generation powered stapling that's coming. We're getting great reviews from customers. And again, the most important thing about the powered stapling is, it is a driver for our in defectors with utilizing Tri-Staple technology. So this is just a few things coming in a short-term. And then of course in the midterm, we've talked about our robotics platform. We'll give you a little more insight at SAGES. I want to be cautious to give you any specifics on when we're going to launch, but let's just say its in the midterm and we're excited about that project as well."

Well, thanks, Kristen. First of all, on the businesses like Neurovascular, in particular, and our Surgical Technologies business, the ENT business, the Advanced Energy business, we want to ensure those continue to perform and we feel very good about where they stand in terms of their new product launches and new clinical data that they all have coming out. So very excited about that. Spine, obviously, a lot of questions even on this call regarding spine. That's a multi kind of fully first answer is the turnaround there, we've been having steady quarter-over-quarter growth over the last couple of quarters. This quarter was a little bit of a step back in the U.S., and we anticipate returning to growth next quarter and a continued steady cadence of improvement. And it's really -- there's a couple of things. One, as Omar mentioned, our Core Spine portfolio, we're excited about the products. Our upstream marketing has done a good job building a number of new products, and now we're focused on the downstream commercial execution and the launch of those products. And just this quarter, we have several new ones for lumbar fusion this voyager fixation system and its elevated extendable cage. And the one that I'm particularly really excited about this OLIF procedure, which we think based on the physician feedback we're getting is going to be fairly disruptive to the space. And so we have a number of those new product launches and the big change is launching them at scale, so making sure we have the right amount of sets and inventory to launch them at scale, which is a change. The other component here is our biologic portfolio, which infuse is the biggest piece. That continues to rebound and we continue to get -- we just got a recent -- a new indication for that OLIF procedure I just mentioned and we're working on other indications there for INFUSE and our broader Biologics portfolio. And then finally, Omar only mentioned Surgical Synergy. A little bit of a more nuance view on this one. First of all, when people look at our overall RTG performance, the Spine business dramatically helps our surgical technology business. Our navigation, that business has been about high single-digit, low double-digit growth platform for the last couple of years powered by navigation and the imaging platforms. Without spine, we wouldn't have that type of growth, full stop. But what we need to do is move further upstream and have a tighter technology integration between those 2 units so that our customers feel a differentiated Surgical Synergy experience. And then finally, we are hiring what we're calling ETC reps. These are enabling technology consultants that are really driving the penetration on the ground with the physicians for navigated spine procedures. So it's a number of different things. And look, this is going to be a steady climb back. We're pretty excited about the next 2 quarters, actually, regarding spine. And then getting back to overall RTG that place that we have the, I think, the most weakness actually is in spine because it's moving is neuromodulation. Our weakness in Pain Stim and pain pumps, partially driven by the consent decree for pumps and competition for stem, that's offsetting our growth in DBS and neuro, and that's going to take a few quarters to work through those dynamics."

So I'm not going to get specific about what we have assumed for share buybacks, et cetera, because, obviously, we're not giving guidance. But as we've tried to highlight in our comments, obviously, the revenue growth we would expect to continue in the mid-single-digit revenue range as we talked about. Clearly, we're going to get a significant operating leverage improvement from the earnings standpoint on a constant currency basis because of the value capture we're taking out, because of the medical device tax benefit and how much of that is reinvested and not reinvested will come into play as we go through that whole discussion. And obviously, as you indicated, there'll be share buyback benefits that will be reflected in those numbers. And that's why we indicated that on a constant currency basis, we would expect that we're going to be in the low double-digit to mid-teens earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis if you just take all those factors into consideration. That's after taking out the extra week and you're just comparing apples-to-apples. And as a result of that, then you have the FX impact coming into play. So all we're trying to highlight to people is your assumptions going forward on our leverage assumptions, et cetera, are consistent with what we've been saying. But just remember FX has not went away and just remember that we had an extra week in the current year. So other than that, I won't give you more on the guidance aspect. We'll provide more details as we put together our guidance in the Q4 call."

So that was the primary thing. So FX was a bigger negative on the bottom line in the quarter than what we had originally expected at the beginning of the quarter.

So that's all the best we can do at this point in time, is to give you some indication on which direction these things are going.

The cost takeout, the synergies that we're getting from the standpoint of the Covidien transaction and the leverage we're getting across the rest of the organization, that's the piece that we can control, and that is going right as expected, its in fact ahead of our plans as I mentioned in our previous comments.

As I've said ever since I started here, we can work on things that we can control. While we accept other variables and we've tried to understand completely the valuation of the company based on the actual performance, we can only kind of drive what we can control as best we can, meet our commitments and drive as aggressively as we can. And that we are completely committed to doing. And on that basis, as Gary just pointed out, the cost synergies that we expect from Covidien, we've got pretty granular look at that, we're delivering. We're delivering, this operating team is delivering and they're stretching hard and trying to cover for other things. But there's only so far we can go about things that are not in our control. 
So I just do want to make that point that we haven't lost our operational focus on delivering the synergies one bit and, in many ways, are a little bit ahead of our original commitments. But there's a lot of moving parts there. And we are optimistic about the future and our plans are pretty solid going into fourth quarter and into next year. 
But listen, let me go back to the long-term and really conclude by noting that our overall long-term financial model. And let me remind you what it is, it's consistent mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a reliable basis, which we will get through the diversification of our businesses as well as geographies and our new product cadence. 200 to 400 basis points of constant currency EPS leverage over the long-term, and then some of that may be a little higher in the next couple of years as we realize all the synergies from the Covidien acquisition as we saw this quarter. And then finally, returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders. That again is a commitment that we're completely living up to, and we expect to see that fulfilled in the upcoming quarters.
Stepping back even further, look, this company is geared around fulfilling our mission, of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life, and that mission continues. We're confident that this team can execute consistently, balancing our trade-offs and offsetting pressures. And in the end, we're committed to creating long-term dependable value in health care.

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued, for the first time, a presentation that provides additional details on our revenue performance, and as a result, have reduced our prepared revenue-by-division commentary in Gary's section.

Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 and all year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters.

This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6%, in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.06, growing at 17% on a comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 1,150 basis points of leverage, significantly above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points.
Our performance in Q3 was solid, with sustained execution resulting in another quarter of market outperformance. We continued to deliver on our 3 growth strategies: therapy innovation; globalization; and economic value, which are driving increased diversity of our growth, an important and differentiated attribute of our company.
Our revenue growth may modestly ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter, indicative of the challenges we are absorbing in certain businesses or regions as we capitalize on success in others. However, our confidence around the sustainability and consistency of our revenue growth within the mid-single digit range continues to build with each passing quarter.
In addition, the Covidien integration is delivering robust operating leverage as we realize our committed cost synergies, which combined with our financial leverage, drove high-teens EPS growth and double-digit EPS leverage in Q3. Through FY '18, as we continue to realize cost synergy benefits, we expect to be at the high end of or exceed our EPS leverage goal of 200 to 400 basis points.
While our operational performance remains strong, we recognize foreign currency translation is still a significant pressure to our bottom line on a reported basis, as it is for most multinational companies of our size and diversity. We are attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs. We also continue to generate significant accessible free cash flow, which we are deploying with discipline, investing for our future while at the same time allocating capital to reduce debt and provide strong returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, our formula for long-term success is to deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth, with 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage and a return -- and return a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. The expected net result is creating enormous value, with sustainable double-digit total shareholder returns.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. As we have noted before, we have 3 growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: new therapies; emerging markets; and services and solutions, with specific growth expectations for each. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals.
In therapy innovation, we continue to see strong adoption of our new products and our pipeline remains robust. Our new therapies growth vector accounted for nearly 2/3 of our total company growth, contributing approximately 350 basis points, at the high end of our goal of 150 to 350 basis points. Based on our pipeline and product breadth, we believe performance in the upper half of this range is sustainable over the long term.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 7%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important rapidly growing med tech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF ablation, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. CVG is also seeing highly-differentiated new products drive growth in its pace businesses. 
In drug-eluting stents, our Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity stents are holding share despite major competitive launches. Our position in Europe has been strengthened further by the recent addition of new sizes and indications for Resolute Onyx. In High Power, the Evera MRI ICD that we launched last fall resulted in improved pricing in the U.S. ICD market and a multiyear high share position.
Looking ahead, we have a number of new products that will continue to differentiate us in the CVG market and help protect and grow our leadership position. These include our MRI-conditional CRT-D devices, which recently received FDA approval and are currently launching in the U.S. and Europe. We also continued to make progress in bringing our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. and Japan, and we had a successful FDA advisory panel on this technology 2 weeks ago.
Our longer-term CVG pipeline is also robust, with potentially disruptive therapies like our drug-filled stent, Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve and SYMPLICITY Spyral renal denervation system.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 5%, with Surgical Solutions growing above market and PMR growing at market. Innovative technologies that advance and enhance minimally invasive surgery are driving strong above market growth. Looking ahead, the majority of MITG's growth will come from 5 key growth drivers.
Within Surgical Solutions, open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal cancer and lung cancer; and within PMR, End Stage Renal Disease and respiratory compromise. Of these, the largest contributor to growth is expected to come from our open to MIS strategy, which is focused on sustainable, long-term surgical market leadership by improving open surgery, transitioning open surgeries to MIS and advancing MIS technologies.
Our recently created new business, Renal Care Solutions, supplemented its breadth with the acquisition of Bellco last month. Bellco has a full line of therapies and systems for the treatment of renal failure. This combination of Bellco with our legacy renal axis business and our internally developed portable dialysis system, offers a complete product solution for End Stage Renal Disease.
To fuel the global growth drivers that I just mentioned, MITG has a strong product portfolio and expects to launch more than 20 products through the end of fiscal year '17, with approximately 75% in Surgical Solutions and approximately 25% in PMR. These new offerings are expected to generate approximately $500 million in cumulative revenue over the next 3 years.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 4%, we also have a number of new products driving growth. In Neurovascular, our Pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. Following the 4 clinical trials published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the market continues to adopt our Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy device, a segment of the global ischemic stroke market that we think can triple in size by 2020.
In Surgical Technologies, we're seeing strong growth from our recently launched O-arm O2 surgical imaging system.
In Spine, despite posting mid-single-digit growth in international Core Spine and double-digit growth in U.S. BMP, Q3 results came in below our expectations, primarily because of weakness in U.S. Core Spine. We're focused on executing our turnaround plan in Spine. Our primary focus is growing our market share through what we are calling Speed to Scale product launches. Speed to Scale involves coming to market with a steady cadence of new products as a result of faster innovation cycles and launching these products at scale, with sets available for the entire market. These new products will also be combined with enabling technologies, biologics and targeted physician training at the time of launch. The goal is to constantly innovate procedures such as OLIF and TLIF and improve upon their outcomes. We have several near-term launches, including accelerated ramps of Solera Voyager and our ELEVATE expandable interbody device, both of which are expected to improve our share in TLIF procedures, an area where we've been struggling. 
This quarter, we will launch ATLANTIS Essentials, another cervical plate system, the first product in our Spine Essentials platform. Spine Essentials will bring efficiency to the most common spine fusion procedures through more streamlined pre-sterilized sets.
Additionally, we are further integrating the development roadmaps of our enabling technologies with our spine instrumentation, offering a differentiated Surgical Synergy experience for our customers. And finally, we intend to focus our efforts in gaining share in Biografts, utilizing our broad biologics portfolio, including INFUSE.
We had challenges this quarter in our Neuromodulation division as well. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused on resolving this matter, our drug pump revenue has been affected. We're also facing increased competition in Pain Stim. Our recently improved MRI surgical lead is expected to help our competitive position in Pain Stim, as we are the first company to have a complete spinal cord stimulation system approved for full body MRI scans. In addition, we continue to market the benefits of our differentiated AdaptiveStim and SureScan MRI technology. And more surgeons are adopting our AdaptiveStim HD high density programming options. 
While we're focused on solving the issues in Spine and Neuromodulation, and our efforts in Spine are expected to result in steady improvement, Neuromodulation could be under some pressure for the next several quarters, resulting in overall RTG growth around the low end of the mid-single-digit range.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 11%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system in the markets where it is available as well as strong demand for our MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the user's smartphone. We also continue to make excellent progress in bringing the world's first hybrid closed loop system, the MiniMed 670G to market. We expect to complete enrollment in our pivotal trial in the next few weeks, with PMA submission to the FDA targeted before the end of June.
Outside the U.S., we had strong Q3 performance. We were pleased by the positive guidance recently issued by NICE in the United Kingdom, which recommended the MiniMed Paradigm Veo as the only system for reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business for type 2, our partnership with Henry Schein is underway and we're already starting to see interest from primary care physicians for our iPro 2 professional CGM system with Pattern Snapshot.
In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are preparing to bring our standalone CGM system, Guardian Connect, to market for the PMA submission in the U.S. next week as well as expected launch in Europe in early FY '17. This product will allow us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our standalone CGM product with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we are well-positioned to provide patients with not just a sensor, but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. Overall, we're excited by the progress of our Diabetes business and feel we're well-positioned for sustained growth.
Next, let's discuss our globalization strategy. In Q3, emerging markets grew 14% and contributed approximately 190 basis points to our Q3 total company growth, at the upper end of our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We have consistently delivered double-digit growth in emerging markets, despite the fact that several of these markets have faced macroeconomic pressures. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies in channel optimization and in developing public and private partnerships. We have also benefited from increased geographic diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency on any single market.
In Q3, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, India and Greater China all grew in the mid- to upper teens. In China, we grew 14%, where our strong sales execution and expansion of our multiline selling presence into Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets is resulting in above market growth. We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy, which aims to transition our distribution partnerships to include consolidated logistics platform distributors. We're also developing comprehensive partnerships with provincial governments, like that with the Chengdu government in Sichuan Province, where we previously announced a partnership to manufacture our portable hemodialysis equipment. In Q3, we broadened our partnership with Chengdu, agreeing to manufacture our next-generation diabetes pump technology in Chinese language for the local market in Sichuan, while working together with local authorities to expand access for this product. China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Despite the complexities of this market, we have shown that we can grow double digits in China on a sustained basis. We believe China will become our largest healthcare market over the long term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country, and we can never lose sight of this potential.
In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 19%, driven by the joint venture we formed earlier this year with our largest Saudi distributor as part of our channel optimization strategy in the region.
In Latin America, we grew 10%, including 7% growth in Brazil. While we continue to outperform the market in Brazil, we do see continued market volume weakness resulting from public spending constraints as well as some difficulty in getting inventory into the country because of customs holds.
Across the emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization like in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, establishing government partnerships in Chengdu and developing private partnerships like the one we established with the Abraaj Group last year -- last quarter. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth in these regions and lead to sustained market outperformance. We believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to economic value growth strategy. Our Services & Solutions growth vector contributed approximately 20 basis points for Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points revenue growth, our revenue growth was in the mid-30s and contributed 50 basis points to CVG growth, where our efforts are most developed. We expect to further improve our growth as Services & Solutions model is expanded across all our business groups.
In Care Management Services, formerly known as Cardiocom, our growth rate was in the mid-20s in Q3, driven by strong performance within the U.S. Veterans Administration healthcare system, where we are managing a cohort of over 8,500 patients with multiple comorbidities. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions.
In our Hospital Solutions business, through which we provide expertise in operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth rates in the mid-30s. Since the time we started this business a little over 2 years ago, we have now completed a total of 72 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $1.7 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have 7 hospitals in Latin America and 7 in the Middle East and Africa. We continue to attract strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world, and we have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We are pleased with the progress we're making in expanding Hospital Solutions into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have signed 5 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of 7 years.
We are also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management through Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center we acquired almost a year ago. We continue to grow the number of contracted patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond the Netherlands over time. Through initiatives like Diabeter, as well as others that I mentioned earlier, we are transforming our Diabetes Group from a market-leading pump and sensor business into a holistic diabetes management business.
While all of these services and solutions, Care Management Services, Cath Lab and operating room management services and Diabeter, are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important future building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where payment will be based in measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon. We are rapidly developing expertise in these areas, with a particular focus in supporting bundled solutions across the care continuum, targeting specific patient cohorts requiring a particular intervention. This is consistent with the direction of CMS' bundled payment initiative and their first implementation, Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement, or CJR, which we fully support. While this initiative is still evolving, it is one that is mandatory, consistent and measurable, which allows it to be scalable. We encourage CMS to expand bundled payments to other clinical areas where we participate more broadly. 
Health care is going through a necessary transformation, where stakeholders are seeking not only to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care, but are also looking for solutions to optimize cost and efficiency. Our confidence continues to grow in Medtronic's ability to lead and compete in these new value-based health care models around the world. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers. We remain convinced that our technologies and services can play a central role to make the shift to value-based health care successful.
Turning now to the P&L. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage of -- in Q3 of 1,150 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, as we deliver on our productivity improvements and cost synergy programs. Operating leverage in the quarter was 510 basis points, driven predominantly by the improvement in SG&A, which is the line item where the majority of the Covidien integration cost synergies that we're realizing today are located. The remainder of our EPS leverage was driven by improvements in our interest expense and tax rate, as well as share repurchase activity.
Our strong revenue growth and operating leverage is generating significant adjusted free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $1.8 billion and expect to generate nearly $40 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the next 5 years. We also continue to look for ways to untrap cash in our balance sheet. Last September, we announced that we had untrapped $9.3 billion of cash. And last month, we announced how we intend to use these proceeds. We are executing an incremental $5 billion share repurchase that we intend to complete by the end of FY '18. We intend to use a majority of the remaining proceeds to either prepay existing debt or pay debt that comes due by the end of fiscal year 2018 in order to meet our commitments to our debt investors.
We are deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis even earlier than we had previously announced. 
Regarding share repurchases, with the incremental $5 billion share repurchase, we expect to return approximately $15 billion to shareholders over 3 years, more than double the amount we returned over the past 3 years. 
With our M&A investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential opportunities. Any investment we make must meet our portfolio criteria, which are: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes; allow for Medtronic to add value; and it must have a team that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must be aligned with and strengthen 1 or more of our 3 growth strategies, meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution.
Before turning the call over to Gary, I'd like to conclude by commenting briefly on our Covidien integration activities, which continue to go extremely well. We're executing on our priorities of preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We have preserved and in many cases accelerated the growth of both companies. Talent retention and employee satisfaction remain high as our 2 cultures continue to come together. Our value capture programs are resulting in strong operating leverage. And we have meaningfully improved the sustainability of both our growth through the diversification of our revenue base and our capital allocation goals through the increased access to our cash.
In summary, Q3 was another quarter of solid execution by our organization. Our operating leverage is coming through as we expected. And I'm pleased with how we are positioning the company to deliver growth consistently and reliably. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary?"
31348,326107474,944934,"Medtronic plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2016",2016-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $6,934,000,000 increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 20 ba",1915,"Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $6,934,000,000 increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 20 basis points to the Q3 revenue growth. 
Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, a decrease of 1% versus the $1.07 delivered by legacy Medtronic last year, or an increase of 17% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.11 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation.
Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.77, a decrease of 21%.
In addition to the $374 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: A $43 million charge for acquisition-related items; a $16 million net restructuring charge; and a $25 million benefit resulting from the establishment of a deferred tax asset related to the realization of a onetime capital loss.
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 7%, with all 3 divisions growing at or above overall company growth. CRHF grew 6% as we took significant share in a flat global implantables market. In High Power, our strong Evera MRI launch resulted in our highest U.S. High Power share since early in the decade, despite the fact that we had declines in CRT-D. While our CRT-D business experienced sequential growth in U.S. implant share, we also had an intentional reduction in customer inventories, ahead of our Q4 CRT-D MRI launch.
In Coronary, we are holding global diluted earnings -- drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitor data releases and product launches, which we attribute to increasing preference for the Resolute Onyx in Europe and our CVG multiline contracts in U.S. 
In transcatheter valves, we grew in the low 30s, consistent with the market. Market share growth in Europe and the initial launch of CoreValve in Japan in the back half of Q3 balanced modest U.S. share loss, where a competitor product launch and a lack of having Evolut R in the largest valve segment, limited total U.S. growth to the mid-20s. 
We were pleased to receive IDE approval for our U.S. low-risk trial, and it is worth noting that we now expect the global TAVR market will grow to approximately $4 billion by the end of 2020. 
In Peripheral, we maintained drug-coated balloon market leadership globally and in the U.S. on the strength of our clinically differentiated IN.PACT Admiral balloon.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 33% of our total company sales, grew revenue 5%, with strong at or above market performance in both divisions. 
In Surgical Solutions, both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy grew in the upper-single digits, although we estimate that U.S. surgical volumes have normalized now at 1% to 2%.
The PMR division grew 1%, as the business was affected by a product hold of the Puritan Bennett  980 ventilator, which resulted in an approximate negative $10 million to $15 million impact to the quarter. This is expected to affect quarterly PMR revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million until the product returns to the market, which is expected in the first half of next fiscal year.
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 4%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies offsetting declines in Spine and Neuromodulation.
In Spine, while U.S. Core Spine was challenged, we gained international Core Spine share.
In BMP, the U.S. had strong low double-digit growth. However, the InductOs ship hold in Europe is expected to continue through mid-FY '17.
In Neuromodulation, we recently received FDA approval for Parkinson's patients with early onset motor complications, expanding the number of potential patients that can be treated with DBS therapy.
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of total company sales, grew revenue 11%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions.
In IIM, our type 1 business, we are seeing very good growth, driven by the MiniMed 640G. 
In NDT, our type 2 business, while the revenue base is still small, we're seeing growth over 250% as we continue to drive our iPro 2 Professional CGM solution and the new easy-to-interpret Pattern Snapshot report into the primary care channel.
In DSS, our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we saw high single-digit growth, driven by U.S. consumable sales, our Diabeter acquisition and continued strong adoption of our MiniMed Connect remote connectivity platform.
Now turning to the P&L. As I discuss the operating items, it is worth clarifying that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis, unless I say otherwise. 
The Q3 operating margin was 29.2%. This represents a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year. But this improvement was completely offset on a reported basis by a negative 140 basis point impact from foreign currency. The 140 basis point operating margin improvement included a 140 basis point improvement in SG&A, offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin, a 10 basis point increase in R&D and a 20 basis point improvement in net other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of over 10% or operating leverage of approximately 510 basis points over revenue growth.
Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.5%, SG&A of 33.3% and R&D of 7.6%. Also included in our Q3 operating margin was net other expense of $9 million, which included net currency gains of $78 million, primarily from our earnings hedging program. It is worth noting that included in these net gains was an unexpected $21 million expense resulting from a revaluation of the Argentine peso-denominated assets, which devalued by approximately 30%.
Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include $1.09 euro and a JPY 113, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $5 million expense to $15 million of income, which includes approximately $110 million in currency gains and no longer includes the U.S. medical device tax, which has been suspended.
We expect our Q4 operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.3% on an as-reported basis based on current exchange rates. This forecast implies an approximate 300 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a constant currency basis.
Our value capture programs as a result of the Covidien integration remain on track, and we now expect to exceed our original FY '16 savings goal of $300 million to $350 million and continue to target a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY '18.
Below the operating profit line, Q3 net interest expense was $176 million, in line with our forecast. Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $210 million. This is an increase over prior quarters, as the execution of our incremental share repurchases results in reduced interest income.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q3 was 14.3%, which was an improvement from our forecast due to the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit as well as operational tax adjustments. For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%.
In Q3, adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile.
In Q3, we paid $534 million in dividends and repurchased $710 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,422,000,000 shares. For FY '16, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1,427,000,000 shares, including approximately 1,419,000,000 shares in Q4. 
Next, I would like to comment on our revenue outlook. We expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter of FY '16 to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our prior outlook of second half revenue being in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline goal. This is solid revenue growth, especially when you consider the strong upper single-digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year.
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $180 million to $220 million.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We continue to expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.36 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
Next, I would like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2017. While we intend to provide revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance per our normal practice on our Q4 call, here are some items to keep in mind as you think about our next fiscal year. 
First, on revenue growth. While we are not formally providing our FY '17 revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis, consistent with our baseline expectations. However, keep in mind that we had an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY '16. This will negatively affect our Q1 FY '17 revenue growth rate by approximately 600 basis points and our full fiscal year revenue growth rate by approximately 150 basis points and has a commensurate impact to earnings per share. 
Regarding foreign exchange, given current rates, we expect a few hundred million dollar negative impact in FY '17 revenue and expect it to negatively affect FY '17 earnings per share by approximately $0.20 to $0.25, primarily from the loss of significant hedging gains we had in FY '16 as well as continued pressure from unhedged emerging market currencies.
Based on the operating leverage from our Covidien integration activities as well as the financial leverage from share repurchases we expect to generate in FY '17, we would expect constant currency earnings per share growth to be in double digits to lower teens after adjusting for the extra week in FY '16, which would exceed our baseline goal of generating 200 to 400 basis points of earnings per share leverage.
Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we plan to hold our Q4 earnings call on May 31. We also plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held in New York City. Omar?"

And as I mentioned in my comments, 510 points on the operating margin line, just of leverage there and a 140 basis point improvement on an operating basis. Unfortunately, with foreign exchange, it's been a headwind all year. It's having a similar negative impact on the margin, and so we didn't get as much of improvement than we might see on an as-reported basis just because of that. So as we've been doing all year, we're basically, we're continuing to execute against our operating leverage plans and our cost takeout synergies that we have from the Covidien transaction. But as with many companies, we're experiencing the foreign exchange that's mitigating or eliminating a lot of that benefit that we are -- as we roll through that. We're trying to manage that the best we can, but clearly, that's having a big impact. The Covidien synergies, the integration costs, we're coming right on plan. In fact, as I mentioned in my comments, we're ahead of schedule and we're probably -- we clearly will exceed the $300 million, $350 million that we assumed in the current year. We are seeing a lot of leverage here in Q3, and as we had indicated, and even in Q4, we'll continue to see improvement in that operating margin as a result of the synergies. So we're right in line with things, but I agree with you, I think FX is kind of camouflaging some of the real benefits you're seeing from an operations perspective."

The overall procedure volumes, based on the economy, I think were more or less steady. I think in Surgical Solutions, maybe a slight drop in procedure volumes, but essentially they were steady and there was no economy-related issues. The third aspect was simply our new products. And like I said, these new products will kind of come and go on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And in general, we still had pretty strong performance from new therapies. But in prior quarters, which was even stronger, even a larger kind of set of synergies of different products coming in at the same time. I think that's going to go float up and down. And that, I think, is the main factor here in the change in the U.S. market. But I have to point out that our whole model is based on diversification, because we can't depend on just one market. And as you saw this quarter, emerging markets picked up a little bit and essentially sort of offset the drop in our U.S. revenue. But I think overall, from a market perspective, it's pretty steady."

We tried to give some highlights of some things to consider as you go through the model. But the point is, as we've tried to highlight here, even for the current year and as we go forward, we are continuing to expect the revenue growth to be in that mid single-digit range as we go forward. We are expecting we're going to continue to get the operating synergies and be at the high end of the, and in fact exceed probably, the earnings growth that we've been expecting from the value capture of the Covidien transaction, and that's going just as we expected. It's coming in, in fact, a little bit ahead of schedule at this point in time. And so we feel confident that will be positive as we go into the next fiscal year, obviously. Foreign exchange continues to be a major headwind for us, as it is with many multinational companies. And ours, because of the hedging programs we did, if anything, if you think about it from a foreign exchange, we had a $0.45 to $0.50 impact from the current year. Well that was with significant gains that we had from our hedging program. So our impact was somewhat muted from maybe where other companies who don't hedge were at. That is going to come to a head for us in FY '17. And as we indicate, that's potentially another $0.20 to $0.25 of impact as we go into next year. You're right, we're going to have some benefit from the medical device tax. We're getting some already in the current year, that's helping, give us even more operating leverage than what we were expecting previously. But again, the foreign exchange is kind of offsetting that as we kind of drive through this. And so there's positives from the medical device tax, there's going to be positives from our share repurchase. All those are factors we're taking into consideration. But I think if you lay all those together, I think you're going to find that they play out like we've indicated in our comments, because -- but the issues with foreign exchange is clearly is still a significant headwind for us.

One is one of our competitors had an extra few days, extra week in their prior year quarter, which is causing the market to look like it's slower than perhaps it actually is, in addition to the fact that we have this drawdown that I just referenced. So if you kind of correct for those items, we think the overall market was relatively flat, with Low Power growing in low single digits and High Power basically declining in the low single digits.

Obviously, we have not seen, relative to the intermediate risk group, is it going to be noninferior or superior.

But we do, on a monthly basis, an employee engageme",606,"Sure. So generally speaking, I have to say, if you look at MITG, everything is going well. Pull back and just talk about that for a second, and then I'll get into the products and health of the business. But we do, on a monthly basis, an employee engagement survey, just to kind of check the pulse of the organization as we are going through the integration. And happy to say that those results come back very positive. As a matter fact, within MITG, the scores are slightly higher even in legacy Medtronic. And so being acquired and having a number of changes that are occurring in our business and still having those scores come back with an engagement perspective that high, gives me confidence that we're going to have a retention of key talent, which we're working very hard to do and we're going to continue our momentum. So I think that's probably, first and foremost in my opinion, the most important thing. Second to that, I'd say just you're going to see a number of nice things coming from our Surgical business. I referenced in the prepared document that we have greater than 20 products across MITG being launched that will drive close to $0.5 billion in revenue over the next 3 years or so. So we have a very healthy portfolio of products. Just a couple that I'll call out that you'll see again in SAGES would be new generators that we have in our Advanced Energy line. One of them would be a next-generation ForceTriad generator that will focus on better speed to seal. And also provide the capability to drive new LigaSure instruments, and that's the most important thing about that generator. It will give us the capability to drive instruments. That will be a little more unique in the marketplace. And I'll talk about one of those in a second. We also have a generator that we are launching that is specifically for emerging markets, that takes that same capability in LigaSure and provide a lower-cost generator so we can get access to those markets as well. That actually launched a quarter ago. And then one of the new instruments that I mentioned in Energy will be a multifunction device. And this is important because what you're looking for in the perfect world in Advanced Energy is to be able to divide tissue to skeletonize [ph] either organs or vessels that you're trying to take, and you want to do that typically with a product that divides well or cuts well. But at the same time, you'd like to use that instrument for sealing. And that one of these products that we're going to be launching and talking about at SAGES will do both of those very well. This has been elusive for everybody in the marketplace to get it done and we think we figured it out and we're going to talk about that at SAGES. And then we have a couple of items in Stapling. We've got our next-generation powered stapling that's coming. We're getting great reviews from customers. And again, the most important thing about the powered stapling is it is a driver for our end effectors with utilizing Tri-Staple technology. So this is just a few things coming in the short term. And then of course in the midterm, we've talked about our robotics platform. We'll give you a little more insight at SAGES. I want to be cautious to give you any specifics on when we're going to launch, but let's just say it's in the midterm and we're excited about that project as well."

It's obviously a legacy Covidien unit and some weakness still amongst the Spine business. How quickly do you think that it will take to really turn, I guess, the franchises around? Clearly, we've seen kind of the turn within R&D functions within the cardiovascular group. What are some of the different things that you're doing within Spine? Are you wrapping some of the solutions around it? Or what's kind of the approach and change of, I guess, strategy within RTG?"

Well, thanks, Kristen. First of all, on the businesses like Neurovascular, in particular, and our Surgical Technologies business, the ENT business, the Advanced Energy business, we want to ensure those continue to perform and we feel very good about where they stand in terms of their new product launches and new clinical data that they all have coming out. So very excited about that. Spine, obviously, a lot of questions even on this call regarding Spine. That's a multi kind of -- fully -- first answer is the turnaround there, we've been having steady quarter-over-quarter growth over the last couple of quarters. This quarter was a little bit of a step back in the U.S., and we anticipate returning to growth next quarter and a continued steady cadence of improvement. And it's really -- there's a couple of things. One, as Omar mentioned, our Core Spine portfolio, we're excited about the products. Our upstream marketing guys have done a good job building a number of new products, and now we're focused on the downstream commercial execution and the launch of those products. And just this quarter, we have several new ones for lumbar fusion, this Voyager fixation system and this ELEVATE expandable cage. And the one that I'm particularly really excited about is this OLIF procedure, which we think, based on the physician feedback we're getting, is going to be fairly disruptive to the space. And so we have a number of those new product launches and the big change is launching them at scale, so making sure we have the right amount of sets and inventory to launch them at scale, which is a change. The other component here is our biologic portfolio, which INFUSE is the biggest piece. That continues to rebound and we continue to get -- we just got a recent -- a new indication for that OLIF procedure I just mentioned and we're working on other indications there for INFUSE and our broader biologics portfolio. And then finally, Omar already mentioned Surgical Synergy. A little bit of a more nuanced view on this one. First of all, when people look at our overall RTG performance, the Spine business dramatically helps our Surgical Technology business. Our navigation, that business has been about a high single-digit, low double-digit growth platform for the last couple of years, powered by navigation and the imaging platforms. Without Spine, we wouldn't have that type of growth, full stop. But what we need to do is move further upstream and have a tighter technology integration between those 2 units so that our customers feel a differentiated Surgical Synergy experience. And then finally, we are hiring what we're calling ETC reps. These are enabling technology consultants that are really driving the penetration on the ground with the physicians for navigated spine procedures. So it's a number of different things. And look, this is going to be a steady climb back. We're pretty excited about the next 2 quarters, actually, regarding Spine. And then getting back to overall RTG, the place that we have the, I think, the most weakness, actually, in Spine, because it's moving, is Neuromodulation. Our weakness in Pain Stim and pain pumps, partially driven by the consent decree for pumps and competition for Stim, that's offsetting our growth in DBS and neuro, and that's going to take a few quarters to work through those dynamics."

So I'm not going to get specific about what we assume for share buybacks, et cetera, because obviously, we're not giving guidance yet. But as we were trying to highlight in our comments, obviously, the revenue growth we would expect to kind of continue in the mid-single-digit revenue range, as we talked about. Clearly, we're going to get a significant operating leverage improvement from the earnings standpoint on a constant currency basis because of the value capture we're taking out, because of the medical device tax benefit and how much of that is reinvested and not reinvested will come into play as we go through that whole discussion. And obviously, as you indicated, there'll be share buyback benefits that will be reflected in those numbers. And that's why we indicated that on a constant currency basis, we would expect that we're going to be in the low double-digit to mid-teens earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis if you just take all those factors into consideration. That's after taking out the extra week if you're just comparing apples-to-apples. And as a result of that, then you'll have the FX impact coming into play. So all we're trying to highlight to people is your assumptions going forward on our leverage assumptions, et cetera, are consistent with what we've been saying. But just remember FX has not went away and just remember that we had an extra week in the current year. So other than that, I won't give you more on the guidance aspect.

So that was the primary thing. So FX was a bigger negative on the bottom line in the quarter than what we had originally expected at the beginning of the quarter.

As I've said ever since I started here, we can work on things that we can control.

And that we are completely committed to doing. And on that basis, as Gary just pointed out, the cost synergies that we expect from Covidien, we've got a pretty granular look at that, we're delivering. We're delivering, this operating team is delivering and they're stretching hard and trying to cover for other things. But there's only so far we can go about things that are not in our control. 
So I just do want to make that point that we haven't lost our operational focus on delivering these synergies one bit, and in many ways, are a little bit ahead of our original commitments. But there's a lot of moving parts there. And we are optimistic about the future and our plans are pretty solid going into fourth quarter and into next year. 
But listen, let me go back to the long term and really conclude by noting that our overall long-term financial model. And let me remind you what it is, it's consistent with single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a reliable basis, which we will get through the diversification of our businesses as well as geographies and our new product cadence. 200 to 400 basis points of constant currency EPS leverage over the long term, and then some of that may be a little higher in the next couple of years as we realize all the synergies from the Covidien acquisition, as we saw this quarter. And then finally, returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders. That again is a commitment that we're completely living up to, and we expect to see that fulfilled in the upcoming quarters.
Stepping back even further, look, this company is geared around fulfilling our mission, of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life, and that mission continues. We're confident that this team can execute consistently, balancing our trade-offs and offsetting pressures. And in the end, we're committed to creating long-term dependable value in health care.

In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. 
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 and all year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters.

We continued to deliver on our 3 growth strategies: therapy innovation; globalization; and economic value, which are driving increased diversity of our growth, an important and differentiated attribute of our company.
Our revenue growth may modestly ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter, indicative of the challenges we are absorbing in certain businesses or regions as we capitalize on success in others. However, our confidence around the sustainability and consistency of our revenue growth within the mid-single digit range continues to build with each passing quarter.
In addition, the Covidien integration is delivering robust operating leverage as we realize our committed cost synergies, which combined with our financial leverage, drove high-teens EPS growth and double-digit EPS leverage in Q3. Through FY '18, as we continue to realize cost synergy benefits, we expect to be at the high end of or exceed our EPS leverage goal of 200 to 400 basis points.
While our operational performance remains strong, we recognize foreign currency translation is still a significant pressure to our bottom line on a reported basis, as it is for most multinational companies of our size and diversity. We are attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs. We also continue to generate significant accessible free cash flow, which we are deploying with discipline, investing for our future while at the same time allocating capital to reduce debt and provide strong returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, our formula for long-term success is to deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth, with 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage and a return -- and return a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. The expected net result is creating enormous value, with sustainable double-digit total shareholder returns.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. As we have noted before, we have 3 growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: new therapies; emerging markets; and services and solutions, with specific growth expectations for each. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals.
In therapy innovation, we continue to see strong adoption of our new products and our pipeline remains robust. Our new therapies growth vector accounted for nearly 2/3 of our total company growth, contributing approximately 350 basis points, at the high end of our goal of 150 to 350 basis points. Based on our pipeline and product breadth, we believe performance in the upper half of this range is sustainable over the long term.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 7%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important rapidly growing med tech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF ablation, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. CVG is also seeing highly-differentiated new products drive growth in its base businesses. 
In drug-eluting stents, our Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity stents are holding share despite major competitive launches. Our position in Europe has been strengthened further by the recent addition of new sizes and indications for Resolute Onyx. In High Power, the Evera MRI ICD that we launched last fall resulted in improved pricing in the U.S. ICD market and a multiyear high share position.
Looking ahead, we have a number of new products that will continue to differentiate us in the CVG market and help protect and grow our leadership position. These include our MRI-conditional CRT-D devices, which recently received FDA approval and are currently launching in the U.S. and Europe. We also continued to make progress in bringing our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. and Japan, and we had a successful FDA advisory panel on this technology 2 weeks ago.
Our longer-term CVG pipeline is also robust, with potentially disruptive therapies like our drug-filled stent, Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve and SYMPLICITY Spyral renal denervation system.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 5%, with Surgical Solutions growing above market and PMR growing at market. Innovative technologies that advance and enhance minimally invasive surgery are driving strong above market growth. Looking ahead, the majority of MITG's growth will come from 5 key growth drivers.
Within Surgical Solutions, open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal cancer and lung cancer; and within PMR, End Stage Renal Disease and respiratory compromise. Of these, the largest contributor to growth is expected to come from our open to MIS strategy, which is focused on sustainable, long-term surgical market leadership by improving open surgery, transitioning open surgeries to MIS and advancing MIS technologies.
Our recently created new business, Renal Care Solutions, supplemented its breadth with the acquisition of Bellco last month. Bellco has a full line of therapies and systems for the treatment of renal failure. This combination of Bellco with our legacy renal axis business and our internally developed portable dialysis system, offers a complete product solution for End Stage Renal Disease.
To fuel the global growth drivers that I just mentioned, MITG has a strong product portfolio and expects to launch more than 20 products through the end of fiscal year '17, with approximately 75% in Surgical Solutions and approximately 25% in PMR. These new offerings are expected to generate approximately $500 million in cumulative revenue over the next 3 years.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 4%, we also have a number of new products driving growth. In Neurovascular, our Pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. Following the 4 clinical trials published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the market continues to adopt our Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy device, a segment of the global ischemic stroke market that we think can triple in size by 2020.
In Surgical Technologies, we're seeing strong growth from our recently launched O-arm O2 surgical imaging system.
In Spine, despite posting mid-single-digit growth in international Core Spine and double-digit growth in U.S. BMP, Q3 results came in below our expectations, primarily because of weakness in U.S. Core Spine. We're focused on executing our turnaround plan in Spine. Our primary focus is growing our market share through what we are calling Speed to Scale product launches. Speed to Scale involves coming to market with a steady cadence of new products as a result of faster innovation cycles and launching these products at scale, with sets available for the entire market. These new products will also be combined with enabling technologies, biologics and targeted physician training at the time of launch. The goal is to constantly innovate procedures such as OLIF and TLIF and improve upon their outcomes. We have several near-term launches, including accelerated ramps of Solera Voyager and our ELEVATE expandable interbody device, both of which are expected to improve our share in TLIF procedures, an area where we've been struggling. 
This quarter, we will launch ATLANTIS Essentials, another cervical plate system, the first product in our Spine Essentials platform. Spine Essentials will bring efficiency to the most common spine fusion procedures through more streamlined pre-sterilized sets.
Additionally, we are further integrating the development roadmaps of our enabling technologies with our spine instrumentation, offering a differentiated Surgical Synergy experience for our customers. And finally, we intend to focus our efforts in gaining share in Biografts, utilizing our broad biologics portfolio, including INFUSE.
We had challenges this quarter in our Neuromodulation division as well. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused on resolving this matter, our drug pump revenue has been affected. We're also facing increased competition in Pain Stim. Our recently improved MRI surgical lead is expected to help our competitive position in Pain Stim, as we are the first company to have a complete spinal cord stimulation system approved for full body MRI scans. In addition, we continue to market the benefits of our differentiated AdaptiveStim and SureScan MRI technology. And more surgeons are adopting our AdaptiveStim HD high density programming options. 
While we're focused on solving the issues in Spine and Neuromodulation, and our efforts in Spine are expected to result in steady improvement, Neuromodulation could be under some pressure for the next several quarters, resulting in overall RTG growth around the low end of the mid-single-digit range.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 11%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system in the markets where it is available as well as strong demand for our MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the user's smartphone. We also continue to make excellent progress in bringing the world's first hybrid closed loop system, the MiniMed 670G to market. We expect to complete enrollment in our pivotal trial in the next few weeks, with PMA submission to the FDA targeted before the end of June.
Outside the U.S., we had strong Q3 performance. We were pleased by the positive guidance recently issued by NICE in the United Kingdom, which recommended the MiniMed Paradigm Veo as the only system for reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business for type 2, our partnership with Henry Schein is underway and we're already starting to see interest from primary care physicians for our iPro 2 professional CGM system with Pattern Snapshot.
In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are preparing to bring our standalone CGM system, Guardian Connect, to market for the PMA submission in the U.S. next week as well as expected launch in Europe in early FY '17. This product will allow us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our standalone CGM product with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we are well-positioned to provide patients with not just a sensor, but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. Overall, we're excited by the progress of our Diabetes business and feel we're well-positioned for sustained growth.
Next, let's discuss our globalization strategy. In Q3, emerging markets grew 14% and contributed approximately 190 basis points to our Q3 total company growth, at the upper end of our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We have consistently delivered double-digit growth in emerging markets, despite the fact that several of these markets have faced macroeconomic pressures. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies in channel optimization and in developing public and private partnerships. We have also benefited from increased geographic diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency on any single market.
In Q3, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, India and Greater China all grew in the mid- to upper teens. In China, we grew 14%, where our strong sales execution and expansion of our multiline selling presence into Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets is resulting in above market growth. We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy, which aims to transition our distribution partnerships to include consolidated logistics platform distributors. We're also developing comprehensive partnerships with provincial governments, like that with the Chengdu government in Sichuan Province, where we previously announced a partnership to manufacture our portable hemodialysis equipment. In Q3, we broadened our partnership with Chengdu, agreeing to manufacture our next-generation diabetes pump technology in Chinese language for the local market in Sichuan, while working together with local authorities to expand access for this product. China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Despite the complexities of this market, we have shown that we can grow double digits in China on a sustained basis. We believe China will become our largest healthcare market over the long term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country, and we can never lose sight of this potential.
In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 19%, driven by the joint venture we formed earlier this year with our largest Saudi distributor as part of our channel optimization strategy in the region.
In Latin America, we grew 10%, including 7% growth in Brazil. While we continue to outperform the market in Brazil, we do see continued market volume weakness resulting from public spending constraints as well as some difficulty in getting inventory into the country because of customs holds.
Across the emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization like in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, establishing government partnerships in Chengdu and developing private partnerships like the one we established with the Abraaj Group last year -- last quarter. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth in these regions and lead to sustained market outperformance. We believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to economic value growth strategy. Our Services & Solutions growth vector contributed approximately 20 basis points for Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points revenue growth, our revenue growth was in the mid-30s and contributed 50 basis points to CVG growth, where our efforts are most developed. We expect to further improve our growth as Services & Solutions model is expanded across all our business groups.
In Care Management Services, formerly known as Cardiocom, our growth rate was in the mid-20s in Q3, driven by strong performance within the U.S. Veterans Administration healthcare system, where we are managing a cohort of over 8,500 patients with multiple comorbidities. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions.
In our Hospital Solutions business, through which we provide expertise in operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth rates in the mid-30s. Since the time we started this business a little over 2 years ago, we have now completed a total of 72 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $1.7 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have 7 hospitals in Latin America and 7 in the Middle East and Africa. We continue to attract strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world, and we have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We are pleased with the progress we're making in expanding Hospital Solutions into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have signed 5 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of 7 years.
We are also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management through Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center we acquired almost a year ago. We continue to grow the number of contracted patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond the Netherlands over time. Through initiatives like Diabeter, as well as others that I mentioned earlier, we are transforming our Diabetes Group from a market-leading pump and sensor business into a holistic diabetes management business.
While all of these services and solutions, Care Management Services, Cath Lab and operating room management services and Diabeter, are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important future building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where payment will be based in measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon. We are rapidly developing expertise in these areas, with a particular focus in supporting bundled solutions across the care continuum, targeting specific patient cohorts requiring a particular intervention. This is consistent with the direction of CMS' bundled payment initiative and their first implementation, Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement, or CJR, which we fully support. While this initiative is still evolving, it is one that is mandatory, consistent and measurable, which allows it to be scalable. We encourage CMS to expand bundled payments to other clinical areas where we participate more broadly. 
Health care is going through a necessary transformation, where stakeholders are seeking not only to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care, but are also looking for solutions to optimize cost and efficiency. Our confidence continues to grow in Medtronic's ability to lead and compete in these new value-based health care models around the world. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers. We remain convinced that our technologies and services can play a central role to make the shift to value-based health care successful.
Turning now to the P&L. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage of -- in Q3 of 1,150 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, as we deliver on our productivity improvements and cost synergy programs. Operating leverage in the quarter was 510 basis points, driven predominantly by the improvement in SG&A, which is the line item where the majority of the Covidien integration cost synergies that we're realizing today are located. The remainder of our EPS leverage was driven by improvements in our interest expense and tax rate, as well as share repurchase activity.
Our strong revenue growth and operating leverage is generating significant adjusted free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $1.8 billion and expect to generate nearly $40 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the next 5 years. We also continue to look for ways to untrap cash in our balance sheet. Last September, we announced that we had untrapped $9.3 billion of cash. And last month, we announced how we intend to use these proceeds. We are executing an incremental $5 billion share repurchase that we intend to complete by the end of FY '18. We intend to use a majority of the remaining proceeds to either prepay existing debt or pay debt that comes due by the end of fiscal year 2018 in order to meet our commitments to our debt investors.
We are deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis even earlier than we had previously announced. 
Regarding share repurchases, with the incremental $5 billion share repurchase, we expect to return approximately $15 billion to shareholders over 3 years, more than double the amount we returned over the past 3 years. 
With our M&A investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential opportunities. Any investment we make must meet our portfolio criteria, which are: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes; allow for Medtronic to add value; and it must have a team that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must be aligned with and strengthen 1 or more of our 3 growth strategies, meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution.
Before turning the call over to Gary, I'd like to conclude by commenting briefly on our Covidien integration activities, which continue to go extremely well. We're executing on our priorities of preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We have preserved and in many cases accelerated the growth of both companies. Talent retention and employee satisfaction remain high as our 2 cultures continue to come together. Our value capture programs are resulting in strong operating leverage. And we have meaningfully improved the sustainability of both our growth through the diversification of our revenue base and our capital allocation goals through the increased access to our cash.
In summary, Q3 was another quarter of solid execution by our organization. Our operating leverage is coming through as we expected. And I'm pleased with how we are positioning the company to deliver growth consistently and reliably. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary?"
31348,326107474,945048,"Medtronic plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2016",2016-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $6,934,000,000 increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 20 ba",1915,"Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $6,934,000,000 increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 20 basis points to the Q3 revenue growth. 
Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, a decrease of 1% versus the $1.07 delivered by legacy Medtronic last year, or an increase of 17% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.11 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation.
Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.77, a decrease of 21%.
In addition to the $374 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: A $43 million charge for acquisition-related items; a $16 million net restructuring charge; and a $25 million benefit resulting from the establishment of a deferred tax asset related to the realization of a onetime capital loss.
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 7%, with all 3 divisions growing at or above overall company growth. CRHF grew 6% as we took significant share in a flat global implantables market. In High Power, our strong Evera MRI launch resulted in our highest U.S. High Power share since early in the decade, despite the fact that we had declines in CRT-D. While our CRT-D business experienced sequential growth in U.S. implant share, we also had an intentional reduction in customer inventories, ahead of our Q4 CRT-D MRI launch.
In Coronary, we are holding global diluted earnings -- drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitor data releases and product launches, which we attribute to increasing preference for the Resolute Onyx in Europe and our CVG multiline contracts in U.S. 
In transcatheter valves, we grew in the low 30s, consistent with the market. Market share growth in Europe and the initial launch of CoreValve in Japan in the back half of Q3 balanced modest U.S. share loss, where a competitor product launch and a lack of having Evolut R in the largest valve segment, limited total U.S. growth to the mid-20s. 
We were pleased to receive IDE approval for our U.S. low-risk trial, and it is worth noting that we now expect the global TAVR market will grow to approximately $4 billion by the end of 2020. 
In Peripheral, we maintained drug-coated balloon market leadership globally and in the U.S. on the strength of our clinically differentiated IN.PACT Admiral balloon.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 33% of our total company sales, grew revenue 5%, with strong at or above market performance in both divisions. 
In Surgical Solutions, both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy grew in the upper-single digits, although we estimate that U.S. surgical volumes have normalized now at 1% to 2%.
The PMR division grew 1%, as the business was affected by a product hold of the Puritan Bennett  980 ventilator, which resulted in an approximate negative $10 million to $15 million impact to the quarter. This is expected to affect quarterly PMR revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million until the product returns to the market, which is expected in the first half of next fiscal year.
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 4%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies offsetting declines in Spine and Neuromodulation.
In Spine, while U.S. Core Spine was challenged, we gained international Core Spine share.
In BMP, the U.S. had strong low double-digit growth. However, the InductOs ship hold in Europe is expected to continue through mid-FY '17.
In Neuromodulation, we recently received FDA approval for Parkinson's patients with early onset motor complications, expanding the number of potential patients that can be treated with DBS therapy.
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of total company sales, grew revenue 11%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions.
In IIM, our type 1 business, we are seeing very good growth, driven by the MiniMed 640G. 
In NDT, our type 2 business, while the revenue base is still small, we're seeing growth over 250% as we continue to drive our iPro 2 Professional CGM solution and the new easy-to-interpret Pattern Snapshot report into the primary care channel.
In DSS, our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we saw high single-digit growth, driven by U.S. consumable sales, our Diabeter acquisition and continued strong adoption of our MiniMed Connect remote connectivity platform.
Now turning to the P&L. As I discuss the operating items, it is worth clarifying that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis, unless I say otherwise. 
The Q3 operating margin was 29.2%. This represents a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year. But this improvement was completely offset on a reported basis by a negative 140 basis point impact from foreign currency. The 140 basis point operating margin improvement included a 140 basis point improvement in SG&A, offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin, a 10 basis point increase in R&D and a 20 basis point improvement in net other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of over 10% or operating leverage of approximately 510 basis points over revenue growth.
Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.5%, SG&A of 33.3% and R&D of 7.6%. Also included in our Q3 operating margin was net other expense of $9 million, which included net currency gains of $78 million, primarily from our earnings hedging program. It is worth noting that included in these net gains was an unexpected $21 million expense resulting from a revaluation of the Argentine peso-denominated assets, which devalued by approximately 30%.
Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include $1.09 euro and a JPY 113, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $5 million expense to $15 million of income, which includes approximately $110 million in currency gains and no longer includes the U.S. medical device tax, which has been suspended.
We expect our Q4 operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.3% on an as-reported basis based on current exchange rates. This forecast implies an approximate 300 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a constant currency basis.
Our value capture programs as a result of the Covidien integration remain on track, and we now expect to exceed our original FY '16 savings goal of $300 million to $350 million and continue to target a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY '18.
Below the operating profit line, Q3 net interest expense was $176 million, in line with our forecast. Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $210 million. This is an increase over prior quarters, as the execution of our incremental share repurchases results in reduced interest income.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q3 was 14.3%, which was an improvement from our forecast due to the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit as well as operational tax adjustments. For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%.
In Q3, adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile.
In Q3, we paid $534 million in dividends and repurchased $710 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,422,000,000 shares. For FY '16, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1,427,000,000 shares, including approximately 1,419,000,000 shares in Q4. 
Next, I would like to comment on our revenue outlook. We expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter of FY '16 to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our prior outlook of second half revenue being in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline goal. This is solid revenue growth, especially when you consider the strong upper single-digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year.
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $180 million to $220 million.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We continue to expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.36 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
Next, I would like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2017. While we intend to provide revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance per our normal practice on our Q4 call, here are some items to keep in mind as you think about our next fiscal year. 
First, on revenue growth. While we are not formally providing our FY '17 revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis, consistent with our baseline expectations. However, keep in mind that we had an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY '16. This will negatively affect our Q1 FY '17 revenue growth rate by approximately 600 basis points and our full fiscal year revenue growth rate by approximately 150 basis points and has a commensurate impact to earnings per share. 
Regarding foreign exchange, given current rates, we expect a few hundred million dollar negative impact in FY '17 revenue and expect it to negatively affect FY '17 earnings per share by approximately $0.20 to $0.25, primarily from the loss of significant hedging gains we had in FY '16 as well as continued pressure from unhedged emerging market currencies.
Based on the operating leverage from our Covidien integration activities as well as the financial leverage from share repurchases we expect to generate in FY '17, we would expect constant currency earnings per share growth to be in double digits to lower teens after adjusting for the extra week in FY '16, which would exceed our baseline goal of generating 200 to 400 basis points of earnings per share leverage.
Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we plan to hold our Q4 earnings call on May 31. We also plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held in New York City. Omar?"

And as I mentioned in my comments, 510 points on the operating margin line, just of leverage there and a 140 basis point improvement on an operating basis. Unfortunately, with foreign exchange, it's been a headwind all year. It's having a similar negative impact on the margin, and so we didn't get as much of improvement than we might see on an as-reported basis just because of that. So as we've been doing all year, we're basically, we're continuing to execute against our operating leverage plans and our cost takeout synergies that we have from the Covidien transaction. But as with many companies, we're experiencing the foreign exchange that's mitigating or eliminating a lot of that benefit that we are -- as we roll through that. We're trying to manage that the best we can, but clearly, that's having a big impact. The Covidien synergies, the integration costs, we're coming right on plan. In fact, as I mentioned in my comments, we're ahead of schedule and we're probably -- we clearly will exceed the $300 million, $350 million that we assumed in the current year. We are seeing a lot of leverage here in Q3, and as we had indicated, and even in Q4, we'll continue to see improvement in that operating margin as a result of the synergies. So we're right in line with things, but I agree with you, I think FX is kind of camouflaging some of the real benefits you're seeing from an operations perspective."

I think in Surgical Solutions, maybe a slight drop in procedure volumes, but essentially they were steady and there was no economy-related issues. The third aspect was simply our new products. And like I said, these new products will kind of come and go on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And in general, we still had pretty strong performance from new therapies. But in prior quarters, which was even stronger, even a larger kind of set of synergies of different products coming in at the same time. I think that's going to go float up and down. And that, I think, is the main factor here in the change in the U.S. market. But I have to point out that our whole model is based on diversification, because we can't depend on just one market. And as you saw this quarter, emerging markets picked up a little bit and essentially sort of offset the drop in our U.S. revenue. But I think overall, from a market perspective, it's pretty steady."

We tried to give some highlights of some things to consider as you go through the model. But the point is, as we've tried to highlight here, even for the current year and as we go forward, we are continuing to expect the revenue growth to be in that mid single-digit range as we go forward. We are expecting we're going to continue to get the operating synergies and be at the high end of the, and in fact exceed probably, the earnings growth that we've been expecting from the value capture of the Covidien transaction, and that's going just as we expected. It's coming in, in fact, a little bit ahead of schedule at this point in time. And so we feel confident that will be positive as we go into the next fiscal year, obviously. Foreign exchange continues to be a major headwind for us, as it is with many multinational companies. And ours, because of the hedging programs we did, if anything, if you think about it from a foreign exchange, we had a $0.45 to $0.50 impact from the current year. Well that was with significant gains that we had from our hedging program. So our impact was somewhat muted from maybe where other companies who don't hedge were at. That is going to come to a head for us in FY '17. And as we indicate, that's potentially another $0.20 to $0.25 of impact as we go into next year. You're right, we're going to have some benefit from the medical device tax. We're getting some already in the current year, that's helping, give us even more operating leverage than what we were expecting previously. But again, the foreign exchange is kind of offsetting that as we kind of drive through this. And so there's positives from the medical device tax, there's going to be positives from our share repurchase. All those are factors we're taking into consideration. But I think if you lay all those together, I think you're going to find that they play out like we've indicated in our comments, because -- but the issues with foreign exchange is clearly is still a significant headwind for us.

One is one of our competitors had an extra few days, extra week in their prior year quarter, which is causing the market to look like it's slower than perhaps it actually is, in addition to the fact that we have this drawdown that I just referenced. So if you kind of correct for those items, we think the overall market was relatively flat, with Low Power growing in low single digits and High Power basically declining in the low single digits.

But we do, on a monthly basis, an employee engageme",606,"Sure. So generally speaking, I have to say, if you look at MITG, everything is going well. Pull back and just talk about that for a second, and then I'll get into the products and health of the business. But we do, on a monthly basis, an employee engagement survey, just to kind of check the pulse of the organization as we are going through the integration. And happy to say that those results come back very positive. As a matter fact, within MITG, the scores are slightly higher even in legacy Medtronic. And so being acquired and having a number of changes that are occurring in our business and still having those scores come back with an engagement perspective that high, gives me confidence that we're going to have a retention of key talent, which we're working very hard to do and we're going to continue our momentum. So I think that's probably, first and foremost in my opinion, the most important thing. Second to that, I'd say just you're going to see a number of nice things coming from our Surgical business. I referenced in the prepared document that we have greater than 20 products across MITG being launched that will drive close to $0.5 billion in revenue over the next 3 years or so. So we have a very healthy portfolio of products. Just a couple that I'll call out that you'll see again in SAGES would be new generators that we have in our Advanced Energy line. One of them would be a next-generation ForceTriad generator that will focus on better speed to seal. And also provide the capability to drive new LigaSure instruments, and that's the most important thing about that generator. It will give us the capability to drive instruments. That will be a little more unique in the marketplace. And I'll talk about one of those in a second. We also have a generator that we are launching that is specifically for emerging markets, that takes that same capability in LigaSure and provide a lower-cost generator so we can get access to those markets as well. That actually launched a quarter ago. And then one of the new instruments that I mentioned in Energy will be a multifunction device. And this is important because what you're looking for in the perfect world in Advanced Energy is to be able to divide tissue to skeletonize [ph] either organs or vessels that you're trying to take, and you want to do that typically with a product that divides well or cuts well. But at the same time, you'd like to use that instrument for sealing. And that one of these products that we're going to be launching and talking about at SAGES will do both of those very well. This has been elusive for everybody in the marketplace to get it done and we think we figured it out and we're going to talk about that at SAGES. And then we have a couple of items in Stapling. We've got our next-generation powered stapling that's coming. We're getting great reviews from customers. And again, the most important thing about the powered stapling is it is a driver for our end effectors with utilizing Tri-Staple technology. So this is just a few things coming in the short term. And then of course in the midterm, we've talked about our robotics platform. We'll give you a little more insight at SAGES. I want to be cautious to give you any specifics on when we're going to launch, but let's just say it's in the midterm and we're excited about that project as well."

It's obviously a legacy Covidien unit and some weakness still amongst the Spine business. How quickly do you think that it will take to really turn, I guess, the franchises around? Clearly, we've seen kind of the turn within R&D functions within the cardiovascular group. What are some of the different things that you're doing within Spine? Are you wrapping some of the solutions around it? Or what's kind of the approach and change of, I guess, strategy within RTG?"

Well, thanks, Kristen. First of all, on the businesses like Neurovascular, in particular, and our Surgical Technologies business, the ENT business, the Advanced Energy business, we want to ensure those continue to perform and we feel very good about where they stand in terms of their new product launches and new clinical data that they all have coming out. So very excited about that. Spine, obviously, a lot of questions even on this call regarding Spine. That's a multi kind of -- fully -- first answer is the turnaround there, we've been having steady quarter-over-quarter growth over the last couple of quarters. This quarter was a little bit of a step back in the U.S., and we anticipate returning to growth next quarter and a continued steady cadence of improvement. And it's really -- there's a couple of things. One, as Omar mentioned, our Core Spine portfolio, we're excited about the products. Our upstream marketing guys have done a good job building a number of new products, and now we're focused on the downstream commercial execution and the launch of those products. And just this quarter, we have several new ones for lumbar fusion, this Voyager fixation system and this ELEVATE expandable cage. And the one that I'm particularly really excited about is this OLIF procedure, which we think, based on the physician feedback we're getting, is going to be fairly disruptive to the space. And so we have a number of those new product launches and the big change is launching them at scale, so making sure we have the right amount of sets and inventory to launch them at scale, which is a change. The other component here is our biologic portfolio, which INFUSE is the biggest piece. That continues to rebound and we continue to get -- we just got a recent -- a new indication for that OLIF procedure I just mentioned and we're working on other indications there for INFUSE and our broader biologics portfolio. And then finally, Omar already mentioned Surgical Synergy. A little bit of a more nuanced view on this one. First of all, when people look at our overall RTG performance, the Spine business dramatically helps our Surgical Technology business. Our navigation, that business has been about a high single-digit, low double-digit growth platform for the last couple of years, powered by navigation and the imaging platforms. Without Spine, we wouldn't have that type of growth, full stop. But what we need to do is move further upstream and have a tighter technology integration between those 2 units so that our customers feel a differentiated Surgical Synergy experience. And then finally, we are hiring what we're calling ETC reps. These are enabling technology consultants that are really driving the penetration on the ground with the physicians for navigated spine procedures. So it's a number of different things. And look, this is going to be a steady climb back. We're pretty excited about the next 2 quarters, actually, regarding Spine. And then getting back to overall RTG, the place that we have the, I think, the most weakness, actually, in Spine, because it's moving, is Neuromodulation. Our weakness in Pain Stim and pain pumps, partially driven by the consent decree for pumps and competition for Stim, that's offsetting our growth in DBS and neuro, and that's going to take a few quarters to work through those dynamics."

So I'm not going to get specific about what we assume for share buybacks, et cetera, because obviously, we're not giving guidance yet. But as we were trying to highlight in our comments, obviously, the revenue growth we would expect to kind of continue in the mid-single-digit revenue range, as we talked about. Clearly, we're going to get a significant operating leverage improvement from the earnings standpoint on a constant currency basis because of the value capture we're taking out, because of the medical device tax benefit and how much of that is reinvested and not reinvested will come into play as we go through that whole discussion. And obviously, as you indicated, there'll be share buyback benefits that will be reflected in those numbers. And that's why we indicated that on a constant currency basis, we would expect that we're going to be in the low double-digit to mid-teens earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis if you just take all those factors into consideration. That's after taking out the extra week if you're just comparing apples-to-apples. And as a result of that, then you'll have the FX impact coming into play. So all we're trying to highlight to people is your assumptions going forward on our leverage assumptions, et cetera, are consistent with what we've been saying. But just remember FX has not went away and just remember that we had an extra week in the current year. So other than that, I won't give you more on the guidance aspect.

So that was the primary thing. So FX was a bigger negative on the bottom line in the quarter than what we had originally expected at the beginning of the quarter.

On the other hand, what we've tried to provide as far as guidance on what we expect based on what we know right now.

So that's all the best we can do at this point in time, is to give you some indication on which direction these things are going.

The cost takeout, the synergies that we're getting from the standpoint of the Covidien transaction and the leverage we're getting across the rest of the organization, that's the piece that we can control, and that is going right as expected, it's, in fact, ahead of our plans, as I mentioned in our previous comments.

As I've said ever since I started here, we can work on things that we can control.

And that we are completely committed to doing. And on that basis, as Gary just pointed out, the cost synergies that we expect from Covidien, we've got a pretty granular look at that, we're delivering. We're delivering, this operating team is delivering and they're stretching hard and trying to cover for other things. But there's only so far we can go about things that are not in our control. 
So I just do want to make that point that we haven't lost our operational focus on delivering these synergies one bit, and in many ways, are a little bit ahead of our original commitments. But there's a lot of moving parts there. And we are optimistic about the future and our plans are pretty solid going into fourth quarter and into next year. 
But listen, let me go back to the long term and really conclude by noting that our overall long-term financial model. And let me remind you what it is, it's consistent with single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a reliable basis, which we will get through the diversification of our businesses as well as geographies and our new product cadence. 200 to 400 basis points of constant currency EPS leverage over the long term, and then some of that may be a little higher in the next couple of years as we realize all the synergies from the Covidien acquisition, as we saw this quarter. And then finally, returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders. That again is a commitment that we're completely living up to, and we expect to see that fulfilled in the upcoming quarters.
Stepping back even further, look, this company is geared around fulfilling our mission, of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life, and that mission continues. We're confident that this team can execute consistently, balancing our trade-offs and offsetting pressures. And in the end, we're committed to creating long-term dependable value in health care.

It was a year where we launched a number of groundbreaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value-based health care. 
We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion, grew at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with strong progress against each of our 3 strategic pillars: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions. 
Our FY '16 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed on the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY '16 EPS leverage.
We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points, including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. We reinvested in R&D, organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any dilutive impact to EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of our long-term growth and market leadership. 
In FY '16, we untrapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increase our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, well above our minimum commitment of 50%. 
Despite our strong operational performance in FY '16, our non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4% after including the $0.47 negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, we do see this as largely outside our control and we feel that, over the long term, FX should balance itself out.
Now moving to our Q4 performance. 6% revenue growth was very strong, especially when considering this was built upon a 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY '15. We continue to outperform the market, and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in Diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG. 
Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% [ph] growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our 3 growth sectors: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions.
In new therapies, we delivered above-goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 8%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF CryoAblation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. 
In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in High Power from the ongoing launch of the Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI Quad CRT-Ds. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control product. 
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker, 1/10 the size of a traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single-chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricle using proprietary detection algorithms, first developed for our highly successful Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder. 
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES drove sequential [ph] share gains in Europe and our Resolute [indiscernible] transcatheter valve gained share in a rapidly growing [indiscernible] market. 
In APV, our Valiant Captivia Thoracic [indiscernible] -- Heli-FX EndoAnchor  system drove above-market growth. Our IN.PACT [indiscernible] 
Over the past 2 years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry-leading levels of internally driven R&D productivity across its businesses, and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is ahead for CVG at our Investor Day next week.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6%, led by strong above-market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; End Stage Renal Disease; and respiratory compromise. 
Open to MIS grew double digits in Q4, helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio, including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple technology and ValleyLab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double digits, with solid growth in our GI diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe. 
We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam COLON 2 capsule to potentially reach more patients at risk for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the upper single digits, benefiting from our capnography market development efforts. 
We also continue to make progress in bringing our new capital stream 35 [ph] to market in FY '17. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephew's highly profitable and fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We expect this acquisition to close this summer. 
We also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will touch on later. Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at next week's Investor Day.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market, even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine  articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and Pipeline Shield in Europe continued to lead the market. 
In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging, driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy, a business annualizing at over $250 million, our Aquamantys System and PEAK PlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper teens growth. In Core Spine, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in the sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically, we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated overlift [ph] procedures as well as from the recent Solera Voyager, Elevate [ph] and PTC interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. We're also realizing some early benefits from our Speed to Scale initiatives, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the entire market. 
Looking ahead, we're expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc in FY '17. Strong 7-year clinical outcome data on the 2-level PRESTIGE LP were presented earlier this month at AANS. 
As expected, we faced challenges in our Neuromodulation division. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments, we're still experiencing double-digit revenue decline within [ph] our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for 4 quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward. 
In DBS and Pain Stim, we're facing increased competition. But as we look ahead, we're optimistic that drivers such as expanded early-onset DBS indication in the U.S. that we received earlier this year and new strategies that focus our pain strategies in the growing opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance, however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters. 
As we enter FY '17, we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus in the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally, we will report revenue results for 4 divisions comprising RTG: Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses; Brain Therapies, which includes our DBS, which we are now calling Brain Modulation, Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses; and Pain Therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and Interventional Spine [ph].
calling Pelvic Health, Advanced Energy and ENT will be reported externally as the Specialty Therapies division. 
As part of these changes, RTG is adopting the General Manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence of meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Geoff Martha will discuss these changes as well as additional details on his turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10%, we continue to see strong adoption of our Minimed 640G System in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States, despite having anniversary-ed the launch of Minimed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users' smartphone. 
Regarding our pipeline, we are on track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA before the end of [indiscernible]. Once launched, this will be the world's first hybrid closed loop system. 
Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider. UnitedHealthcare saw what others, including U.K. [indiscernible], have seen, that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of an integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the health care system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidence-based outcomes. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schein and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm, Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our type 2 business. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are on track to launch Guardian Connect in Europe with the current enhanced Enlite Sensor in early FY '17 and in the U.S. with the next-generation sensor in the second half of FY '17. 
Guardian Connect allows us provide both type 1 and type 2 patients multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone professional CGM products with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor but with a compressive diabetes management solution. While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our Diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth, and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week's Investor Day.
Our new product pipeline is robust across all 4 of our business groups, and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies' growth vector in the upper half of our 150 to 350 basis point goal. 
Next, let's turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. 
Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into [ph] emerging markets represent the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term.
In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper teens, and India and China grew in the low double digits. Next week at our Investor Day, you will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions. 
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model has expanded across all our business groups. 
In Care Management Services, formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high 20s in Q4, driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans' Administration Health Care System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as postacute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. 
In our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operators, we had service revenue growth in the high 50s. Since starting this business a little over 2 years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have management contracts with hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa. 
We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world and have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the Hospital Solutions model from Cath Labs into operating rooms utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have already signed 10 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average lifespan of 7 years. 
We're also expanding our solutions offerings in disease management. One example is Diabeter, a Netherlands-based Diabetes clinical research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating 4 centers providing holistic Diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care models, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post surgery program and long-term follow-up. 
Their approach is highly successful, and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK's clinics to more countries, providing broader patient access to their monthly display teams of specialists and improving patient outcomes. Through initiatives like Diabetes and NOK as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we're uniquely positioning our business to focus in not just devices, but providing services and solutions across the care continuum. 
While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early stage businesses, they represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings where business models will be based in measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers.
Turning now to the Q4 P&L. We grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18%, and EPS leverage was 1,210 basis points, both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies of over $100 million in the quarter were in line with our expectations, helped drive a 180 basis point improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. 
The culmination of Covidien synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 26 -- 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin included -- including the negative impact of currency, was 30.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. 
This was a result of 3 unplanned items a negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations; second, a 20 basis point impact from the onetime purchase accounting step up on the Bellco acquisition inventory; and third, a 20 basis point impact from higher-than-anticipated scrap and obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to the bottom line. 
Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last June, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near term. 
Regarding share repurchases, in FY '16, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program, completing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY '16. We also continued to use our capital to make strategic and disciplined M&A investments, which must meet our portfolio criteria, namely, the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value, and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. 
In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. 
Before going to Gary, I'd like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of complex moving parts, our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication, teamwork and passion that our 85,000 employees around the world demonstrate every day. We've undertaken the strategy to transform health care. We don't take lightly the challenges this lofty goal places in our organization, and it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish. 
We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in healthcare to serve millions of patients around the globe, fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We're building on our track record of delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth, and with every quarter, we're increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. 
While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well on our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We're looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. 
Gary will now take you through our more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?"

Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 60 basis points to Q4 revenue growth. 
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8% with all 3 divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid-single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned. 
We have now started U.S.-positioned training and shipments of our Micra PPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice in the market in the mid-30s and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with Arctic Front Advance, following the compelling FIRE & ICE trial, which was featured as a latebreaker at ACC and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE & ICE trial on rates of rehospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the latebreaking clinical trials at the Cardiostim Congress. 
In coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitive launches. Due to our customers' increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of Resolute Integrity the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multi-line contracts in many geographies around the world. 
In transcatheter valves, we're seeing strong growth and expect this market growth at $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3 but not having a large size Evolut R. We have started our Evolut R XL clinical, which is a 60-patient, 30-day follow-up trial. 
In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment of -- in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval, and we are moving into continued access for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. 
In Q4, we also saw strong acceptance of CoreValve in Japan, following the first full quarter of launch. In peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our impact admiral drug-coated balloon last month at Charing Cross, including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions. 
We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement for pre-dilatation and replacing it with simple appropriate vessel preparation. These labeling changes now position Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales, grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S., and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter, with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus the 1% -- 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year. 
We are seeing stronger mid-single-digit growth in the U.S., outpatient surgery market while inpatient surgeries are growing in the low single digits. In PMR, quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer. 
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 3%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies and an improved results in spine, which offset low single-digit declines in neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1%, a large improvement over the past 2 quarters. We estimate U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3%. So while we lost share year-over-year, we did gain over 100 basis points of share sequentially. 
We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe, we continue to be affected by the ship hold on our BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue sometime during Q3 FY '17. 
In neuromodulation, it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the interface drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. 
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales, grew revenue 10%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions. It is worth noting that the Diabetes Group double-digit growth came in the face of a competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new businesses. 
Products like Minimed 640G system with enhanced Enlite Sensor and SmartGuard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S., while our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies and Diabetes Services & Solutions divisions also contributed to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for our MiniMed 670G hybrid coal loop system, we believe there are sufficient drivers to continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our Diabetes Group.
Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78. 
In addition to the $348 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were a $118 million charge related to the retirement of $2.7 billion of debt, a $97 million net restructuring charge, an $85 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control. 
The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the onetime Bellco acquisition inventory step up, a negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis points constant currency improvement, which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.
Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4%, all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million, primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year. 
Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. 
Below the operating profit line, Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. 
In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt, utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was untrapped in the transaction last September. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximate $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our Interventional Spine business. 
In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to the timing on certain items that we expected to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target credit profile. 
In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchased $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416,000,000 shares. 
Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal -- initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. 
For FY '17, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis -- constant week basis, which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis point annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY '16. Assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 [ph] euro and a $1.10 [ph] yen, our FY '17 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 million to $75 million, with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year. 
In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% to 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency, constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative 6 percentage point impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY '16 as well as negative $25 million to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately $225 million to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. 
While the expected FX impact on the earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by increased expected FX impact on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY '17 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY '16. For the first quarter of FY '17, we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant currency, constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range. 
However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share growth to be slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar?"

I think if you take a look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong. It was largely driven by OUS revenues and the 640G product, and I think it just shows you what kind of of uptake we can get with a new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive, and here, we have a product that was launched in September of 2013. And so we don't have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe. But I think this underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse, and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues from emerging market revenues and from call it nontype 1 revenues with type 2 and services and solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next-generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results. The traction we're seeing in Europe and the feedback that we are seeing on our new pump platform is great. We expect to see that here in the United States once it's launched, so as we get the 670, we think there's going to be really strong uptick there and as you heard from the commentary, things are on track with respect to that. And then finally, the last point I would make is that between now and when the next-generation pump comes up, Mike, we've got a lot of assets that we can leverage within the Diabetes business in the U.S. But the size of our sales force is the largest, the size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We've the largest scale and service structure for patients. We've got deep and broad payer relationships. And on top of that, we've got a growing type 2 and solutions business here in the United States. So we feel good, even though the competition continues to intensify in the U.S., we feel good that about our overall global performance, and then once things come with a new product, we feel very, very good."

So we're feeling confident about that. We're not getting specific obviously about what we're doing with share buyback but as we indicated previously, when we announced the incremental buyback and if you watched historically, we tend to do that. We said we're going to be more front-end loaded on that, and so I think we can assume the same thing as we go into FY '17 that is it's more front-end loaded than towards the back half of the year. And so -- but we're not getting specific about how much we're going to be including in that piece of it. So as far as tax rate goes, I mean, there's obviously the benefit of the R&D tax credit catch up during the current year.

Revenue growth has to be sustainable and has to be consistent, and that is something that we're feeling as I said better and better about. Having said that, then we need sort of operating leverage like you said, and that in the short term comes from the Covidien synergies, but the Covidien synergies do it places the platform for us from which we can continue the same work. As we keep growing, taking advantage of our scale in our functional cost primarily, we think we've got productivity that has a longtail, a longtail that we can continue to do and in addition to that, our product cost reduction will also have good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which really haven't built any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number because we feel that, that would take longer than in initial 3-year period in the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risk, that's why we didn't get jump into that. But what it does is it gives us continued sustainability beyond the 3-year period. Those are the 2 main things. It's an area of extreme focus for us, and we think it's very important for us to build a plan that's sustainable and that's diversified in a way that is reliable.

So really, our guidance should have been more thought through, and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company because it's a company with a lot of assets and capabilities, and we think that mid-single digits deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in a consistent basis.

I mean, that you've done a deal that looks a little bit accretive, you did a refinancing that looks a little bit accretive. So I might have thought the EPS guidance would be a little bit higher.

It's maybe as much as another $0.03 or $0.04 higher than that, but the dollar strengthens again a little bit. So we're being somewhat cautious because as Omar said, FX has continued to be a headwind for us, and we expect that in next year. You're right, from an operating perspective, things are going very well. The revenue is strong, we're getting the operating leverage we would expect. But there's lots of moving parts.

We're getting a terrific uptick in these things. My only regret is that 2 quarters ago, when we're planning, we didn't plan aggressively enough, and because I think we're hitting our maximum with sets, and if we have more sets, we see more you can see more growth. So that's something we're factoring into our planning going forward to be a little bit more aggressive.

That was a business largely held together based on technology, implantable stimulator and from whether it be gas, which we're now calling public health or whether it be DBS or pain stim, they're all calling on different physicians, specialties, and we really felt we would get more traction if we organized by disease state versus by technology. So that's going to help us, one, focus on the physicians appropriately and two, innovate because when we're innovating, we're looking across the disease state and across the care continuum rather. So that's one change. And the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary is moving into this General Manager structure. So that gets to more execution, and this is something that the CVG has done over the last 4 years, 5 years, where you're having GMs that are 100% general managers and 100% focus on the individual therapy segment that they serve and those products within that therapy segment. And so making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular. So that's another component of that. And then along with this, we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG. And many of the leaders that are now running the group are top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with a different structure, disease state, organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and new players, proven players from other areas in Medtronic, we feel very good as we hit FY '17."

We could have gone the route of insulin delivery because that's also a core competency, but insulin delivery within that type 2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%.

FY '16 was indeed a successful and transformative year for our company, and looking ahead, we feel we're well-positioned to participate and lead in the transformation to value-based healthcare, which can ultimately create long-term dependable value for our shareholders. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Thank you, and all of you, please have a great day. Thanks."

Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the result of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, which ended on April 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. 
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. 
Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015, respectively, and all quarterly year-over-year growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. All annual year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, in addition to adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency translation, includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak."
31348,331123966,993667,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 31, 2016",2016-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our exp",3462,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.27, growing 18% on a constant currency basis. 
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I'd like to recap fiscal 2016. FY '16 was a transformative year for our organization, our first full year after closing the largest-ever MedTech acquisition. It was a year where, in addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions, totaling $1.5 billion. It was a year where we launched a number of groundbreaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value-based health care. 
We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion, grew at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with strong progress against each of our 3 strategic pillars: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions. 
Our FY '16 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed on the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY '16 EPS leverage.
We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points, including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. We reinvested in R&D, organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any dilutive impact to EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of our long-term growth and market leadership. 
In FY '16, we untrapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increase our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, well above our minimum commitment of 50%. 
Despite our strong operational performance in FY '16, our non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4% after including the $0.47 negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, we do see this as largely outside our control and we feel that, over the long term, FX should balance itself out.
Now moving to our Q4 performance. 6% revenue growth was very strong, especially when considering this was built upon a 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY '15. We continue to outperform the market, and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in Diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG. 
Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our 3 growth sectors: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions.
In new therapies, we delivered above-goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 8%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF CryoAblation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. 
In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in High Power from the ongoing launch of the Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI Quad CRT-Ds. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control product. 
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker, 1/10 the size of a traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single-chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricle using proprietary detection algorithms, first developed for our highly successful Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder. 
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES drove sequential [ph] share gains in Europe and our Evolut R transcatheter aortic [ph] valve gained sequential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market. 
In APV, our Valiant Captivia Thoracic stent graft -- Heli-FX EndoAnchor system drove above-market growth. Our IN.PACT [indiscernible].
Over the past 2 years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry-leading levels of internally driven R&D productivity across its businesses, and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is ahead for CVG at our Investor Day next week.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6%, led by strong above-market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; End Stage Renal Disease; and respiratory compromise. 
Open to MIS grew double digits in Q4, helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio, including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple technology and ValleyLab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double digits, with solid growth in our GI diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe. 
We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam COLON 2 capsule to potentially reach more patients at risk for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the upper single digits, benefiting from our capnography market development efforts. 
We also continue to make progress in bringing our new capital stream 35 [ph] to market in FY '17. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephew's highly profitable and fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We expect this acquisition to close this summer. 
We also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will touch on later. Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at next week's Investor Day.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market, even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine  articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and Pipeline Shield in Europe continued to lead the market. 
In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging, driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy, a business annualizing at over $250 million, our Aquamantys System and PEAK PlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper teens growth. In Core Spine, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in the sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically, we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated OLIF procedures as well as from the recent Solera Voyager, Elevate [ph] and PTC interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. We're also realizing some early benefits from our Speed to Scale initiatives, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the entire market. 
Looking ahead, we're expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc in FY '17. Strong 7-year clinical outcome data on the 2-level PRESTIGE LP were presented earlier this month at AANS. 
As expected, we faced challenges in our Neuromodulation division. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments, we're still experiencing double-digit revenue decline in our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for 4 quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward. 
In DBS and Pain Stim, we're facing increased competition. But as we look ahead, we're optimistic that drivers such as expanded early-onset DBS indication in the U.S. that we received earlier this year and new strategies that focus our pain strategies in the growing opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance, however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters. 
As we enter FY '17, we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus in the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally, we will report revenue results for 4 divisions comprising RTG: Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses; Brain Therapies, which includes our DBS, which we are now calling Brain Modulation, Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses; and Pain Therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and Interventional Spine.
[indiscernible] calling Pelvic Health, Advanced Energy and ENT will be reported externally as the Specialty Therapies division. 
As part of these changes, RTG is adopting the General Manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence of meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Geoff Martha will discuss these changes as well as additional details on his turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States, despite having anniversary-ed the launch of MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users' smartphone. 
Regarding our pipeline, we are on track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA before the end of [indiscernible]. Once launched, this will be the world's first hybrid closed loop system. 
Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider. UnitedHealthcare saw what others, including U.K.'s NICE, have seen, that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of an integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the health care system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidence-based outcomes. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schein and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm, Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our type 2 business. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are on track to launch Guardian Connect in Europe with the current Enhanced Enlite sensor in early FY '17 and in the U.S. with the next-generation sensor in the second half of FY '17. 
Guardian Connect allows us provide both type 1 and type 2 patients multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone professional CGM products with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor but with a compressive diabetes management solution. While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our Diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth, and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week's Investor Day.
Our new product pipeline is robust across all 4 of our business groups, and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies' growth vector in the upper half of our 150 to 350 basis point goal. 
Next, let's turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. 
Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represent the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term.
In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper teens, and India and China grew in the low double digits. Next week at our Investor Day, you will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions. 
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model has expanded across all our business groups. 
In Care Management Services, formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high 20s in Q4, driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans' Administration Health Care System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as postacute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. 
In our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth in the high 50s. Since starting this business a little over 2 years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have management contracts with hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa. 
We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world and have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the Hospital Solutions model from cath labs into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have already signed 10 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average lifespan of 7 years. 
We're also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management. One example is Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinical research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating 4 centers providing holistic diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. 
Their approach is highly successful, and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK's clinics to more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists in improving patient outcomes. Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we're uniquely positioning our business to focus on not just devices, but providing services and solutions across the care continuum. 
While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where business models will be based on measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers.
Turning now to the Q4 P&L. We grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18%, and EPS leverage was 1,210 basis points, both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies of over $100 million in the quarter were in line with our expectations, helped drive a 180 basis point improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. 
The combination of Covidien's synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 26 -- 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin included -- including the negative impact of currency, was 30.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. 
This was a result of 3 unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations; second, a 20 basis point impact from the onetime purchase accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory; and third, a 20 basis point impact from higher-than-anticipated scrap and obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to the bottom line. 
Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus on M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last June, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near term. 
Regarding share repurchases, in FY '16, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program, completing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY '16. We also continued to use our capital to make strategic and disciplined M&A investments, which must meet our portfolio criteria, namely: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. 
Before going to Gary, I'd like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of complex moving parts, our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication, teamwork and passion that our 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaken a strategy to transform health care. We don't take lightly the challenges this lofty goal places in our organization, and it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish. 
We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in health care to serve millions of patients around the globe, fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We're building on our track record of delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth. And with every quarter, we're increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. 
While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well on our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We're looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. 
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?"

Fourth quarter revenue of $7,567,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 6% on a constant currency basis, which excludes the $179 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 60 basis points to Q4 revenue growth. 
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8% with all 3 divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid-single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned. 
We have now started U.S. physician training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30s and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with Arctic Front Advance, following the compelling FIRE & ICE trial, which was featured as a late-breaker at ACC and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE & ICE trial on rates of rehospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late-breaking clinical trials at the Cardiostim Congress. 
In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitive launches due to our customers' increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, continuing enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of Resolute Integrity in the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multiline contracts in many geographies around the world. 
In transcatheter valves, we are seeing strong growth and expect this market to grow at $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3, with not having a large-sized Evolut R. We have started our Evolut R XL clinical, which is a 60-patient, 30-day follow-up trial. 
In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment of -- in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval, and we are moving into continued access for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. 
In Q4, we also saw a strong acceptance of CoreValve in Japan, following the first full quarter of launch. In Peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month at Charing Cross, including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions. 
We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement for predilatation and replacing it with simple and appropriate vessel preparation. These labeling changes now position Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales, grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S., and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter, with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus the 1% -- 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year. 
We are seeing stronger mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery market, while inpatient surgeries are growing in the low single digits. In PMR, quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer. 
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 3%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies and an improved results in Spine, which offset low single-digit declines in, Neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1%, a large improvement over the past 2 quarters. We estimate U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3%. So while we lost share year-over-year, we did gain over 100 basis points of share sequentially. 
We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe, we continue to be affected by the ship hold on our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue sometime during Q3 FY '17. 
In Neuromodulation, it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the intrathecal baclofen drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. 
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales, grew revenue 10%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions. It is worth noting that the Diabetes Group double-digit growth came in the face of a competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new businesses. 
Products like MiniMed 640G System with Enhanced Enlite sensor and SmartGuard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S., while our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies and Diabetes Services & Solutions divisions also contributed to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system, we believe there are sufficient drivers to continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our Diabetes Group.
Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78. 
In addition to the $348 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $118 million charge related to the retirement of $2.7 billion of debt, a $97 million net restructuring charge, an $85 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control. 
The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the onetime Bellco acquisition inventory step-up and negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis point constant currency improvement, which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.
Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4%, all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million, primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year. 
Regarding our earnings hedging program. While we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. 
Below the operating profit line, Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. 
In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt, utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was untrapped in a transaction last September. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximate $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our Interventional Spine business. 
In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to the timing on certain items, but we expect it to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. 
In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchased $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorizations to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416,000,000 shares. 
Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal -- initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. 
For FY '17, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis -- constant week basis, which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis point annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY '16. Assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 euro and a $1.10 yen, our FY '17 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 million to $75 million, with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year. 
In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% to 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency, constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative 6 percentage point impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY '16 as well as a negative $25 million to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately $225 million to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. 
While the expected FX impact on earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by an increased expected FX impact on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY '17 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY '16. For the first quarter of FY '17, we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant currency -- constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range. 
However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share growth to be slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar?"

I think if you take a look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong. It was largely driven by OUS revenues and the 640G product, and I think it just shows you what kind of uptake we can get with a new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive. And here, we have a product that was launched in September of 2013. And so we don't have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe. But I think this underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said, is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse, and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues from emerging market revenues and from, call it, nontype 1 revenues with type 2 and Services & Solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next-generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results. The traction we're seeing in Europe and the feedback that we're seeing on our new pump platform is great. We expect to see that here in the United States once it's launched. So as we get the 670, we think there's going to be really strong uptick there. And as you heard from the commentary, things are on track with respect to that. And then finally, the last point I would make is that between now and when the next-generation pump comes up, Mike, we've got a lot of assets that we can leverage within the Diabetes business in the U.S. But the size of our sales force is the largest. The size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We've the largest scale and service infrastructure for patients. We've got deep and broad payer relationships. And on top of that, we've got a growing type 2 and solutions business here in the United States. So we feel good. Even though the competition continues to intensify in the U.S., we feel good that -- about our overall global performance.

As we keep growing, taking advantage of our scale in our functional cost, primarily, we think we've got productivity that has a longtail. A longtail that we can continue to do. And in addition to that, our product cost reduction will also add good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number. Because we feel that, that would take longer than an initial 3-year period in the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risk. That's why we didn't jump into that.

But the reality is, we are expecting some of the operating -- excuse me, some of our synergies to start to be coming in manufacturing line. And so it's possible you could see the gross margin being flat to maybe even slightly improving. But that's probably the biggest fluctuation we saw here in Q4.

I mean, look, our main area of focus is the overall EPS, and we felt that we had all these moving parts with the balance and then get to an EPS number. That tight of a guidance that we have talked about before was really directional in building to the overall EPS. And if there's not -- if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line, we would never have given such a tight range. I mean, the sorts of things that happen, there was no way we could have predicted them. And with things like the Bellco acquisition and its math, we hadn't really done that accurately because we just closed the acquisition like a week before we -- the earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became obvious and there were pressures. And it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term, and it's an extremely accretive kind of positive deal for us. But on an immediate 3-month basis, you can get surprises. So really, our guidance should have been more thought through, and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company because it's a company with a lot of assets and capabilities, and we think that it can grow mid-single digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in a consistent basis. I mean, that's a pretty good deal if we can do that at a constant currency levels. Gary, do you want to say a few words on this topic?"

We should not have done that. We -- but we didn't realize the focus everyone was going to have on it. And the reason I think we were trying to address it and get it out there for the modeling was exactly that. It's not that we're not getting the synergies. In fact, if anything, the Covidien synergies and other operating leverage we're getting across the organization, we feel very good about, and we're tracking that on a very tight basis. It's the other moving parts that you just get from a large organization like this, that gets specific on certain line items is creating an issue. And so what we're trying to do, as Omar said, is focus on we're driving the top line. We have plenty of levers, including all the cost synergies that we are achieving to drive the bottom line. But in general, there's going to be some moving parts in the middle, and we were way too specific in Q3 on a tight range on the operating margin, and that was my mistake."

So -- but then the dollar strengthens again a little bit. So we're just being somewhat cautious because, as Omar said, FX has continued to be a headwind for us and we expect that in the next year. You're right. From an operating perspective, things are going very well. The revenue is strong. We're getting the operating leverage we would expect. But there's also lots of, still, moving parts.

So I'm really happy about that.

My only regret is that, 2 quarters ago, when we're planning, we didn't plan aggressively enough. And because I think we're hitting our maximum with sets.

But -- so there's a couple of changes going on, and we'll get into this next week. But just a summary. One, moving into these different reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease state or condition versus technology. And the example I'll give is neuromodulation. I mean, that was a business largely held together based on technology, an implantable stimulator. And from whether it be Gastro/Uro, which we're now calling public health, or whether it be DBS or pain stim, they're all calling on different physicians, specialties, and we really felt we would get more traction if we organized by disease state versus by technology. So that's going to help us, one, focus on the physicians appropriately; and two, innovate. Because when we're innovating, we're looking across the disease state and across the care continuum, rather. So that's one change. And the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving to this general manager structure. So that gets to more execution, and this is something that the CVG has done over the last 4 years, 5 years, where you're having GMs that are 100% [indiscernible] general managers and 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that they serve and those products within that therapy segment. And so making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular, so that's another component of that. And then along with this, we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG. And many of the leaders that are now running the group have -- are top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure, this disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and new players -- proven players from other areas in Medtronic, where we feel very good as we hit FY '17."

It made a lot more sense to group that together with pain, where we have a lot of associated therapies, and we were missing the big picture look at pain by splitting up all the different, very significant nonopioid therapies that we had. And so this is really a disease-based look and a look at our customers, and that will drive innovation and will drive a clear picture of how we go to market with our sales force. And then it finally leads to value-based healthcare, driving for outcomes. That's the only way in which we're going to do it."

We actually built a small Surgical Synergy team, which is a bridge between that business and our Spine business and looking at an integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out, and that also works for DBS as well. So before, we had 2 separate businesses that weren't linked quite close enough, in my humble opinion, to drive the Surgical Synergy benefit. So we put a small team that includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition. So just in Q4 alone, we had 15 new kind of combined capital equipment Spine, core metal deals, which is significantly more than we've had in the prior 3 quarters combined, and this is something that is a result of that. And as we move forward, you'll see the technology roadmap more integrated. So we've actually built a little bit of a bridge between Spine and our capital equipment business."

This is a new business unit that we put in place a little over a year ago. And we'll talk to you about the product roadmap next week at the Investor Day session, so you'll get more insight there. But suffice it to say that our focus within type 2, first, the type 2 population is 90% of all patients with Diabetes. So it's a huge market opportunity. And when you take a look at those 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the route of insulin delivery because that's also a core competency. But insulin delivery within that type 2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%. The broader opportunity is within monitoring. And what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you're seeing with iPro2 and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions to those type 2 patients. And at the end, our goal isn't just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product. It's really to deliver an integrated solutions to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insights and that can give those patients actionable information so that they can better manage their disease and also to do the same thing for physicians who are managing those patients. So we're really excited about the opportunity. As you said, we're just getting started. But we think there's a tremendous amount of runway in this business."

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. 
Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015, respectively, and all quarterly year-over-year growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. All annual year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, in addition to adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency translation, includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.

31348,331123966,993772,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 31, 2016",2016-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our exp",3460,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.27, growing 18% on a constant currency basis. 
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I'd like to recap fiscal 2016. FY '16 was a transformative year for our organization, our first full year after closing the largest-ever MedTech acquisition. It was a year where, in addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions, totaling $1.5 billion. It was a year where we launched a number of groundbreaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value-based health care. 
We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion, grew at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with strong progress against each of our 3 strategic pillars: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions. 
Our FY '16 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed on the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY '16 EPS leverage.
We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points, including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. We reinvested in R&D, organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any dilutive impact to EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of our long-term growth and market leadership. 
In FY '16, we untrapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increased our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, well above our minimum commitment of 50%. 
Despite our strong operational performance in FY '16, our non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4% after including the $0.47 negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, we do see this as largely outside our control and we feel that, over the long term, FX should balance itself out.
Now moving to our Q4 performance. 6% revenue growth was very strong, especially when considering this was built upon a 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY '15. We continue to outperform the market, and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in Diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG. 
Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our 3 growth sectors: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions.
In new therapies, we delivered above-goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 8%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF CryoAblation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. 
In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in High Power from the ongoing launch of the Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI Quad CRT-Ds. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control product. 
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker, 1/10 the size of a traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single-chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricle using proprietary detection algorithms, first developed for our highly successful Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder. 
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES drove sequential share gains in Europe and our Evolut R transcatheter aortic [ph] valve gained sequential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market. 
In APV, our Valiant Captivia Thoracic stent graft and Heli-FX EndoAnchor system drove above-market growth. Our IN.PACT [indiscernible].
Over the past 2 years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry-leading levels of internally driven R&D productivity across its businesses, and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is ahead for CVG at our Investor Day next week.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6%, led by strong above-market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; End Stage Renal Disease; and respiratory compromise. 
Open to MIS grew double digits in Q4, helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio, including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple technology and ValleyLab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double digits, with solid growth in our GI diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe. 
We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam COLON 2 capsule to potentially reach more patients at risk for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the upper single digits, benefiting from our capnography market development efforts. 
We also continue to make progress in bringing our new capital stream 35 [ph] to market in FY '17. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephew's highly profitable and fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We expect this acquisition to close this summer. 
We also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will touch upon later. Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at next week's Investor Day.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market, even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine  articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and Pipeline Shield in Europe continued to lead the market. 
In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging, driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy, a business annualizing at over $250 million, our Aquamantys System and PEAK PlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper teens growth. In Core Spine, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in the sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically, we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated OLIF procedures as well as from the recent Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. We're also realizing some early benefits from our Speed to Scale initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the entire market. 
Looking ahead, we're expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc in FY '17. Strong 7-year clinical outcome data on the 2-level PRESTIGE LP were presented earlier this month at AANS. 
As expected, we face challenges in our Neuromodulation division. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments, we're still experiencing double-digit revenue declines in our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for 4 quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward. 
In DBS and Pain Stim, we're facing increased competition. But as we look ahead, we're optimistic that drivers such as expanded early-onset DBS indication in the U.S. that we received earlier this year and new strategies that focus our pain strategies in the growing opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance, however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters. 
As we enter FY '17, we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus on the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally, we will report revenue results for 4 divisions comprising RTG: Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses; Brain Therapies, which includes our DBS, which we are now calling Brain Modulation, Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses; and Pain Therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and Intervention business.
[indiscernible] calling Pelvic Health, Advanced Energy and ENT will be reported externally as the Specialty Therapies division. 
As part of these changes, RTG is adopting the General Manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence of meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Geoff Martha will discuss these changes as well as additional details on his turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States, despite having anniversary-ed the launch of MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users' smartphone. 
Regarding our pipeline, we are on track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA before the end of June [ph]. Once launched, this will be the world's first hybrid closed loop system. 
Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider. UnitedHealthcare saw what others, including U.K.'s NICE, have seen, that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of our integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the health care system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidence-based outcomes. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schein and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm, Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our type 2 business. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are on track to launch Guardian Connect in Europe with the current Enhanced Enlite sensor in early FY '17 and in the U.S. with the next-generation sensor in the second half of FY '17. 
Guardian Connect allows us provide both type 1 and type 2 patients multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone professional CGM products with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our Diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth, and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week's Investor Day.
Our new product pipeline is robust across all 4 of our business groups, and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies' growth vector in the upper half of our 150 to 350 basis point goal. 
Next, let's turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. 
Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term.
In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper teens, and India and China grew in the low double digits. Next week at our Investor Day, you will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions. 
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model has expanded across all our business groups. 
In Care Management Services, formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high 20s in Q4, driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans' Administration Health Care System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as postacute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. 
In our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency, as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth in the high 50s. Since starting this business a little over 2 years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have management contracts with hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa. 
We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world and have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the Hospital Solutions model from cath labs into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We've already signed 10 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average lifespan of 7 years. 
We're also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management. One example is Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinical research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating 4 centers providing holistic diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. 
Their approach is highly successful, and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK's clinics to more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists in improving patient outcomes. Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK, as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we're uniquely positioning our business to focus on not just devices, but providing services and solutions across the care continuum. 
While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where business models will be based on measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers.
Turning now to the Q4 P&L. We grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18%, and EPS leverage was 1,210 basis points, both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies of over $100 million in the quarter were in line with our expectations, helped drive a 180 basis point improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. 
The combination of Covidien's synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 26 -- 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin included -- including the negative impact of currency, was 30.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. 
This was a result of 3 unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations; second, a 20 basis point impact from the onetime purchase accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory; and third, a 20 basis point impact from higher-than-anticipated scrap and obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to the bottom line. 
Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus on M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last June, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near term. 
Regarding share repurchases, in FY '16, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program, completing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY '16. We also continue to use our capital to make strategic and disciplined M&A investments, which must meet our portfolio criteria, namely: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. 
Before going to Gary, I'd like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of complex moving parts, our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication, teamwork and passion that our 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaken a strategy to transform health care. We don't take lightly the challenges this lofty goal places in our organization, and it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish. 
We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in health care to serve millions of patients around the globe, fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We're building on our track record of delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth. And with every quarter, we're increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. 
While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well on our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We're looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. 
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?"

In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned. 
We have now started U.S. physician training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30s and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with Arctic Front Advance, following the compelling FIRE & ICE trial, which was featured as a late-breaker at ACC and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE & ICE trial on rates of rehospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late-breaking clinical trials at the Cardiostim Congress. 
In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitive launches due to our customers' increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, continuing enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of Resolute Integrity in the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multiline contracts in many geographies around the world. 
In transcatheter valves, we are seeing strong growth and expect this market to grow at $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3, from not having a large-sized Evolut R. We have started our Evolut R XL clinical, which is a 60-patient, 30-day follow-up trial. 
In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment of -- in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval, and we are moving into continued access for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. 
In Q4, we also saw a strong acceptance of CoreValve in Japan, following the first full quarter of launch. In Peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month at Charing Cross, including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions. 
We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement for predilatation and replacing it with simple, appropriate vessel preparation. These labeling changes now position Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales, grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S., and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter, with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus the 1% -- 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year. 
We are seeing stronger mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery market, while inpatient surgeries are growing in the low single digits. In PMR, quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer. 
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 3%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies and an improved results in Spine, which offset low single-digit declines in Neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1%, a large improvement over the past 2 quarters. We estimate the U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3%. So while we lost share year-over-year, we did gain over 100 basis points of share sequentially. 
We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe, we continue to be affected by the ship hold on our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue sometime during Q3 FY '17. 
In Neuromodulation, it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the intrathecal baclofen drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. 
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales, grew revenue 10%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions. It is worth noting that the Diabetes Group double-digit growth came in the face of a competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new businesses. 
Products like MiniMed 640G System with Enhanced Enlite sensor and SmartGuard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S., while our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies and Diabetes Services & Solutions divisions also contributed to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system, we believe there are sufficient drivers to continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our Diabetes Group.
Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78. 
In addition to the $348 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $118 million charge related to the retirement of $2.7 billion of debt, a $97 million net restructuring charge, an $85 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control. 
The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the onetime Bellco acquisition inventory step-up and negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis point constant currency improvement, which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.
Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4%, all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million, primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year. 
Regarding our earnings hedging program. While we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. 
Below the operating profit line, Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. 
In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt, utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was untrapped in a transaction last September. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximate $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our Interventional Spine business. 
In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to the timing on certain items, but we expect it to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. 
In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchased $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorizations to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416,000,000 shares. 
Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal -- initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. 
For FY '17, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis -- constant week basis, which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis point annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY '16. Assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 euro and a JPY 1.10, our FY '17 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 million to $75 million, with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year. 
In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% to 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency, constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative 6 percentage point impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY '16 as well as a negative $25 million to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately $225 million to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. 
While the expected FX impact on earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by an increased expected FX impact on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY '17 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY '16. For the first quarter of FY '17, we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant currency -- constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range. 
However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share growth to be slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar?"

I think if you take a look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong. It was largely driven by OUS revenues and the 640G product, and I think it just shows you what kind of uptake we can get with a new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive. And here, we have a product that was launched in September of 2013. And so we don't have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe. But I think this underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said, is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse, and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues from emerging market revenues and from, call it, nontype 1 revenues with type 2 and Services & Solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next-generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results. The traction we're seeing in Europe and the feedback that we're seeing on our new pump platform is great. We expect to see that here in the United States once it's launched. So as we get the 670, we think there's going to be really strong uptick there. And as you heard from the commentary, things are on track with respect to that. And then finally, the last point I would make is that between now and when the next-generation pump comes up, Mike, we've got a lot of assets that we can leverage within the Diabetes business in the U.S. But the size of our sales force is the largest. The size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We've the largest scale and service infrastructure for patients. We've got deep and broad payer relationships. And on top of that, we've got a growing type 2 and solutions business here in the United States. So we feel good.

And that, in the short term, comes from the Covidien synergies. But what the Covidien synergies do, is it places a -- builds a platform for us, from which we can continue the same work. As we keep growing, taking advantage of our scale in our functional cost, primarily, we think we've got productivity that has a long tail. A long tail that we can continue to do. And in addition to that, our product cost reduction will also -- has good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number. Because we feel that, that would take longer than an initial 3-year period in the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risks. That's why we didn't jump into that.

When we do get that product, we would expect to be able to have its share performance perform like the other 3 sizes do and provide us share growth opportunities. So that would be the primary sort of current dynamic. In terms of overall market growth, obviously, the -- both internationally and U.S. growth is well above, as I said, high end of where we have been thinking the market would go. We think the positive data in the intermediate segment that has been available, a, from our competitor; and b, from our own sub-analysis of our high risk data, bodes well [indiscernible]. We get essentially an expectation that by the time we get to 2021, we should be looking at a market that is around $4 billion with some modest penetration of the low risk segment, and of course, we've now started clinical trial activities in that low risk segment.

The gross margin issue -- the only comment I'd make to your comments is I'm not so sure that the gross margin will be down. It's possible it will be on an as-reported basis because of FX. But the reality is, we are expecting some of the operating -- excuse me, some of our synergies to start to be coming in the manufacturing line. And so it's possible you could see the gross margin being flat to maybe even slightly improving. But that's probably the biggest fluctuation we saw here in Q4.

I mean, look, our main area of focus is the overall EPS, and we felt that we had all these moving parts with the balance and then get to an EPS number. That tight of a guidance that we have talked about before was really directional in building to the overall EPS. And if there's not -- if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line, we would never have given such a tight range. I mean, the sorts of things that happen, there was no way we could have predicted them. And with things like the Bellco acquisition and its math, we hadn't really done that accurately because we just closed the acquisition like a week before we -- the earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became obvious and there were pressures. And it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term, and it's an extremely accretive kind of positive deal for us. But on an immediate 3-month basis, you can get surprises. So really, our guidance should have been more thought through, and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company because it's a company with a lot of assets and capabilities, and we think that it can grow mid-single digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders on a consistent basis. I mean, that's a pretty good deal if we can do that at a constant currency level. Gary, do you want to say a few words on this topic?"

We should not have done that. We -- but we didn't realize the focus everyone was going to have on it. And the reason I think we were trying to address it and get it out there for the modeling was exactly that. It's not that we're not getting the synergies. In fact, if anything, the Covidien synergies and the other operating leverage we're getting across the organization, we feel very good about, and we're tracking that on a very tight basis. It's the other moving parts that you just get from a large organization like this, that gets specific on certain line items, is creating an issue. And so what we're trying to do, as Omar said, is focus on we're driving the top line. We have plenty of levers, including all the cost synergies that we are achieving to drive the bottom line. But in general, there's going to be some moving parts in the middle, and we were way too specific in Q3 on a tight range on the operating margin, and that was my mistake."

That is, I'll call it, one leg of a multipronged strategy around what we call Surgical Synergies. And we feel, as we move out into the future, these Surgical Synergies will be in Spine, our calling card. We have got very strong enabling technology platforms in navigation and imaging. We're excited about the partnership in robotics with Mazor. And then integrating these platforms as we move forward to provide a -- to differentiate spine procedures, both economically and clinically, and the surgeon experience, low radiation, just an easier surgical procedures, et cetera, we think is going to differentiate our Spine business. And so as you move forward, and this is going to -- this is not -- this isn't 5 years from now. This is going to take place quarter-over-quarter as we continue to emphasize this. So this is something we're very excited about. And as we move forward, outside of Surgical Synergies, we do have a number of products. Starting in our FY '14, FY '15, our Spine business put a lot of effort into revamping the product portfolio, and the products that are hitting the market now are Elevate Cage, for example, Voyager's another one. And this quarter, launching our new OLIF procedures. I'm calling them our second-generation OLIF procedures. We're getting a terrific uptick in these things. My only regret is that, 2 quarters ago, when we were planning, we didn't plan aggressively enough. And because I think we're hitting our maximum with sets. And if we had more sets, we'd even see more -- you could see more growth. So that's something we're factoring into our planning going forward as to be a little bit more aggressive. But both from a product standpoint and then from what we call Surgical Synergy standpoint, things are looking very good for our Spine business right now. And as you pointed out, every quarter, we've improved over the last 5 quarters. And it's a big shift, takes a little bit of time to kind of change the direction. And you should continue to see continued improvement quarter-over-quarter."

But -- so there's a couple of changes going on, and we'll get into this next week. But just a summary. One, moving into these different reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease state or condition versus technology. And the example I'll give is neuromodulation. I mean, that was a business largely held together based on technology, an implantable stimulator. And from whether it be Gastro/Uro, which we're now calling public health, or whether it be DBS or pain stim, they're all calling on different physicians, specialties, and we really felt we would get more traction if we organized by disease state versus by technology. So that's going to help us, one, focus on the physicians appropriately; and two, innovate. Because when we're innovating, we're looking across the disease state and across the care continuum, rather. So that's one change. And the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving to this general manager structure. So that gets to more execution, and this is something that the CVG has done over the last 4 years, 5 years, where you're having GMs that are 100% -- general managers are 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that they serve and those products within that therapy segment. And so making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular, so that's another component of that. And then along with this, we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG. And many of the leaders that are now running the group have -- are top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure, this disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and new players -- proven players from other areas in Medtronic, where we feel are very good as we hit FY '17."

It made a lot more sense to group that together with pain, where we have a lot of associated therapies, and we were missing the big picture look at pain by splitting up all the different, very significant nonopioid therapies that we had. And so this is really a disease-based look and a look at our customers, and that will drive innovation and will drive a clear picture of how we go to market with our sales force. And then it finally leads to value-based healthcare, driving for outcomes. That's the only way in which we're going to do it."

As you know, the enabling technology platforms sit in what we historically called Surgical Technologies, which that component of it is now on our brain business. So NAV and imaging. We actually built a small Surgical Synergy team, which is a bridge between that business and our Spine business and looking at an integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out, and that also works for DBS as well. So before, we had 2 separate businesses that weren't linked quite close enough, in my humble opinion, to drive the Surgical Synergy benefit. So we put a small team that includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition. So just in Q4 alone, we had 15 new kind of combined capital equipment, spine, core metal deals, which is significantly more than we've had in the prior 3 quarters combined, and this is something that is a result of that. And as we move forward, you'll see the technology roadmap more integrated. So we've actually built a little bit of a bridge between Spine and our capital equipment business."

But suffice it to say that our focus within type 2, first, the type 2 population is 90% of all patients with Diabetes. So it's a huge market opportunity. And when you take a look at those 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the route of insulin delivery because that's also a core competency. But insulin delivery within that type 2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%. The broader opportunity is within monitoring. And what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you're seeing with iPro2 and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions to those type 2 patients. And at the end, our goal isn't just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product. It's really to deliver an integrated solution to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insights and that can give those patients actionable information so that they can better manage their disease and also to do the same thing for physicians who are managing those patients. So we're really excited about the opportunity. As you said, we're just getting started. But we think there's a tremendous amount of runway in this business."

This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our exp",3460,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.27, growing 18% on a constant currency basis. 
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I'd like to recap fiscal 2016. FY '16 was a transformative year for our organization, our first full year after closing the largest-ever MedTech acquisition. It was a year where, in addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions, totaling $1.5 billion. It was a year where we launched a number of groundbreaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value-based health care. 
We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion, grew at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with strong progress against each of our 3 strategic pillars: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions. 
Our FY '16 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed on the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY '16 EPS leverage.
We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points, including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. We reinvested in R&D, organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any dilutive impact to EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of our long-term growth and market leadership. 
In FY '16, we untrapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increased our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, well above our minimum commitment of 50%. 
Despite our strong operational performance in FY '16, our non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4% after including the $0.47 negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, we do see this as largely outside our control and we feel that, over the long term, FX should balance itself out.
Now moving to our Q4 performance. 6% revenue growth was very strong, especially when considering this was built upon a 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY '15. We continue to outperform the market, and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in Diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG. 
Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our 3 growth sectors: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions.
In new therapies, we delivered above-goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 8%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF CryoAblation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. 
In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in High Power from the ongoing launch of the Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI Quad CRT-Ds. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control product. 
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker, 1/10 the size of a traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single-chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricle using proprietary detection algorithms, first developed for our highly successful Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder. 
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES drove sequential share gains in Europe and our Evolut R transcatheter aortic [ph] valve gained sequential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market. 
In APV, our Valiant Captivia Thoracic stent graft and Heli-FX EndoAnchor system drove above-market growth. Our IN.PACT [indiscernible].
Over the past 2 years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry-leading levels of internally driven R&D productivity across its businesses, and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is ahead for CVG at our Investor Day next week.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6%, led by strong above-market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; End Stage Renal Disease; and respiratory compromise. 
Open to MIS grew double digits in Q4, helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio, including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple technology and ValleyLab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double digits, with solid growth in our GI diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe. 
We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam COLON 2 capsule to potentially reach more patients at risk for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the upper single digits, benefiting from our capnography market development efforts. 
We also continue to make progress in bringing our new capital stream 35 [ph] to market in FY '17. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephew's highly profitable and fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We expect this acquisition to close this summer. 
We also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will touch upon later. Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at next week's Investor Day.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market, even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and Pipeline Shield in Europe continued to lead the market. 
In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging, driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy, a business annualizing at over $250 million, our Aquamantys System and PEAK PlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper teens growth. In Core Spine, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in the sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically, we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated OLIF procedures as well as from the recent Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. We're also realizing some early benefits from our Speed to Scale initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the entire market. 
Looking ahead, we're expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc in FY '17. Strong 7-year clinical outcome data on the 2-level PRESTIGE LP were presented earlier this month at AANS. 
As expected, we face challenges in our Neuromodulation division. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments, we're still experiencing double-digit revenue declines in our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for 4 quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward. 
In DBS and Pain Stim, we're facing increased competition. But as we look ahead, we're optimistic that drivers such as expanded early-onset DBS indication in the U.S. that we received earlier this year and new strategies that focus our pain strategies in the growing opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance, however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters. 
As we enter FY '17, we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus on the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally, we will report revenue results for 4 divisions comprising RTG: Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses; Brain Therapies, which includes our DBS, which we are now calling Brain Modulation, Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses; and Pain Therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and Intervention business.
[indiscernible] calling Pelvic Health, Advanced Energy and ENT will be reported externally as the Specialty Therapies division. 
As part of these changes, RTG is adopting the General Manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence of meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Geoff Martha will discuss these changes as well as additional details on his turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States, despite having anniversary-ed the launch of MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users' smartphone. 
Regarding our pipeline, we are on track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA before the end of June [ph]. Once launched, this will be the world's first hybrid closed loop system. 
Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider. UnitedHealthcare saw what others, including U.K.'s NICE, have seen, that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of our integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the health care system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidence-based outcomes. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schein and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm, Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our type 2 business. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are on track to launch Guardian Connect in Europe with the current Enhanced Enlite sensor in early FY '17 and in the U.S. with the next-generation sensor in the second half of FY '17. 
Guardian Connect allows us provide both type 1 and type 2 patients multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone professional CGM products with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our Diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth, and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week's Investor Day.
Our new product pipeline is robust across all 4 of our business groups, and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies' growth vector in the upper half of our 150 to 350 basis point goal. 
Next, let's turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. 
Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term.
In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper teens, and India and China grew in the low double digits. Next week at our Investor Day, you will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions. 
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model has expanded across all our business groups. 
In Care Management Services, formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high 20s in Q4, driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans' Administration Health Care System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as postacute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. 
In our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency, as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth in the high 50s. Since starting this business a little over 2 years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have management contracts with hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa. 
We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world and have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the Hospital Solutions model from cath labs into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We've already signed 10 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average lifespan of 7 years. 
We're also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management. One example is Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinical research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating 4 centers providing holistic diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. 
Their approach is highly successful, and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK's clinics to more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists in improving patient outcomes. Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK, as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we're uniquely positioning our business to focus on not just devices, but providing services and solutions across the care continuum. 
While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where business models will be based on measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers.
Turning now to the Q4 P&L. We grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18%, and EPS leverage was 1,210 basis points, both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies of over $100 million in the quarter were in line with our expectations, helped drive a 180 basis point improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. 
The combination of Covidien's synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 26 -- 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin included -- including the negative impact of currency, was 30.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. 
This was a result of 3 unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations; second, a 20 basis point impact from the onetime purchase accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory; and third, a 20 basis point impact from higher-than-anticipated scrap and obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to the bottom line. 
Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus on M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last June, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near term. 
Regarding share repurchases, in FY '16, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program, completing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY '16. We also continue to use our capital to make strategic and disciplined M&A investments, which must meet our portfolio criteria, namely: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. 
Before going to Gary, I'd like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of complex moving parts, our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication, teamwork and passion that our 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaken a strategy to transform health care. We don't take lightly the challenges this lofty goal places in our organization, and it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish. 
We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in health care to serve millions of patients around the globe, fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We're building on our track record of delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth. And with every quarter, we're increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. 
While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well on our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We're looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. 
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?"

Fourth quarter revenue of $7,567,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 6% on a constant currency basis, which excludes the $179 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 60 basis points to Q4 revenue growth. 
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8% with all 3 divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid-single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned. 
We have now started U.S. physician training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30s and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with Arctic Front Advance, following the compelling FIRE & ICE trial, which was featured as a late-breaker at ACC and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE & ICE trial on rates of rehospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late-breaking clinical trials at the Cardiostim Congress. 
In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitive launches due to our customers' increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, continuing enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of Resolute Integrity in the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multiline contracts in many geographies around the world. 
In transcatheter valves, we are seeing strong growth and expect this market to grow at $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3, from not having a large-sized Evolut R. We have started our Evolut R XL clinical, which is a 60-patient, 30-day follow-up trial. 
In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment of -- in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval, and we are moving into continued access for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. 
In Q4, we also saw a strong acceptance of CoreValve in Japan, following the first full quarter of launch. In Peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month at Charing Cross, including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions. 
We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement for predilatation and replacing it with simple, appropriate vessel preparation. These labeling changes now position Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales, grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S., and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter, with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus the 1% -- 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year. 
We are seeing stronger mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery market, while inpatient surgeries are growing in the low single digits. In PMR, quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer. 
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 3%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies and an improved results in Spine, which offset low single-digit declines in Neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1%, a large improvement over the past 2 quarters. We estimate the U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3%. So while we lost share year-over-year, we did gain over 100 basis points of share sequentially. 
We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe, we continue to be affected by the ship hold on our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue sometime during Q3 FY '17. 
In Neuromodulation, it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the intrathecal baclofen drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. 
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales, grew revenue 10%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions. It is worth noting that the Diabetes Group double-digit growth came in the face of a competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new businesses. 
Products like MiniMed 640G System with Enhanced Enlite sensor and SmartGuard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S., while our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies and Diabetes Services & Solutions divisions also contributed to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system, we believe there are sufficient drivers to continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our Diabetes Group.
Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78. 
In addition to the $348 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $118 million charge related to the retirement of $2.7 billion of debt, a $97 million net restructuring charge, an $85 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control. 
The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the onetime Bellco acquisition inventory step-up and negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis point constant currency improvement, which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.
Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4%, all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million, primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year. 
Regarding our earnings hedging program. While we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. 
Below the operating profit line, Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. 
In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt, utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was untrapped in a transaction last September. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximate $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our Interventional Spine business. 
In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to the timing on certain items, but we expect it to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. 
In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchased $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorizations to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416,000,000 shares. 
Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal -- initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. 
For FY '17, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis -- constant week basis, which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis point annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY '16. Assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 euro and a JPY 1.10, our FY '17 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 million to $75 million, with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year. 
In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% to 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency, constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative 6 percentage point impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY '16 as well as a negative $25 million to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately $225 million to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. 
While the expected FX impact on earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by an increased expected FX impact on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY '17 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY '16. For the first quarter of FY '17, we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant currency -- constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range. 
However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share growth to be slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar?"

I think if you take a look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong. It was largely driven by OUS revenues and the 640G product, and I think it just shows you what kind of uptake we can get with a new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive. And here, we have a product that was launched in September of 2013. And so we don't have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe. But I think this underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said, is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse, and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues from emerging market revenues and from, call it, nontype 1 revenues with type 2 and Services & Solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next-generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results. The traction we're seeing in Europe and the feedback that we're seeing on our new pump platform is great. We expect to see that here in the United States once it's launched. So as we get the 670, we think there's going to be really strong uptick there. And as you heard from the commentary, things are on track with respect to that. And then finally, the last point I would make is that between now and when the next-generation pump comes up, Mike, we've got a lot of assets that we can leverage within the Diabetes business in the U.S. But the size of our sales force is the largest. The size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We've the largest scale and service infrastructure for patients. We've got deep and broad payer relationships. And on top of that, we've got a growing type 2 and solutions business here in the United States. So we feel good.

So we're feeling confident about that. We're not getting specific, obviously, about what we're doing with the share buyback. But as we indicated previously when we announced the incremental buyback and if you watched historically, we tend to do that. We said we're going to be more front-end loaded on that. And so I think you could assume the same thing as you go into FY '17. That it's more front-end loaded than towards the back half of the year. And so -- but we're not getting specific about how much we're going to be including in that piece of it. So -- and as far as tax rate goes, I mean, there's obviously the benefit of the R&D tax credit catch up during the current year.

But we're basically saying that our tax rate's going to be relatively flat with where we're currently at. So I wouldn't expect any significant uptick or reduction."

And that, in the short term, comes from the Covidien synergies. But what the Covidien synergies do, is it places a -- builds a platform for us, from which we can continue the same work. As we keep growing, taking advantage of our scale in our functional cost, primarily, we think we've got productivity that has a long tail. A long tail that we can continue to do. And in addition to that, our product cost reduction will also -- has good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number. Because we feel that, that would take longer than an initial 3-year period in the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risks. That's why we didn't jump into that. But what it does is it gives us a continued sustainability beyond the 3-year period. Those are the 2 main things.

But the reality is, we are expecting some of the operating -- excuse me, some of our synergies to start to be coming in the manufacturing line.

And if there's not -- if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line, we would never have given such a tight range. I mean, the sorts of things that happen, there was no way we could have predicted them. And with things like the Bellco acquisition and its math, we hadn't really done that accurately because we just closed the acquisition like a week before we -- the earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became obvious and there were pressures. And it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term, and it's an extremely accretive kind of positive deal for us. But on an immediate 3-month basis, you can get surprises. So really, our guidance should have been more thought through, and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company because it's a company with a lot of assets and capabilities, and we think that it can grow mid-single digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders on a consistent basis.

We should not have done that. We -- but we didn't realize the focus everyone was going to have on it. And the reason I think we were trying to address it and get it out there for the modeling was exactly that. It's not that we're not getting the synergies. In fact, if anything, the Covidien synergies and the other operating leverage we're getting across the organization, we feel very good about, and we're tracking that on a very tight basis. It's the other moving parts that you just get from a large organization like this, that gets specific on certain line items, is creating an issue.

So it's something that we're going to manage from our overall business perspective and not get too kind of line item-focused on that one. Do you guys want to add anything to that?"

It's the -- but the reality is there's benefits that also benefit the rest of the company from those Services & Solutions that actually can potentially help leverage some of the margins on those sides of the equation. So it's a little bit of a headwind, especially here in the near term as Omar said. But as we get those more -- and more efficient at it, we get more productivity out of it, in general, we don't think it will have a huge impact on our overall operating margins. And obviously, it will help solidify and give us more sustainability in our overall revenue growth and even in our overall shares. So we feel good about the prospect overall and how it may -- it increases the bottom line growth. But you're right, in and of themselves, holds those contracts, the Services & Solutions component has a slightly, obviously, lower margin than the rest of the business."

When you layer in our surgical devices into those contracts in a consistent basis, that drives up our volume on very high margin devices, which gets coupled to this transaction and therefore, increases the overall margin rate significantly in those kinds of accounts from what NOK originally had. And so that's the kind of thing that we think we can scale around the world and get significant benefit."

A much greater growth in the MIS procedures versus open, and this is pretty consistent when I look at other players in the marketplace and I look at their revenue growth in the quarter. So I'm really happy about that. And truthfully, that's probably the bigger opportunity, a small uptick in surgical volumes in the U.S. versus a real change in mix shift to MIS, I'll go with the mix shift to MIS all day long. And that's pretty consistent again with what we've seen, what our reps are telling us and what we're seeing from other companies that are playing in the same space.

That is, I'll call it, one leg of a multipronged strategy around what we call Surgical Synergies. And we feel, as we move out into the future, these Surgical Synergies will be in Spine, our calling card. We have got very strong enabling technology platforms in navigation and imaging. We're excited about the partnership in robotics with Mazor. And then integrating these platforms as we move forward to provide a -- to differentiate spine procedures, both economically and clinically, and the surgeon experience, low radiation, just an easier surgical procedures, et cetera, we think is going to differentiate our Spine business. And so as you move forward, and this is going to -- this is not -- this isn't 5 years from now. This is going to take place quarter-over-quarter as we continue to emphasize this. So this is something we're very excited about. And as we move forward, outside of Surgical Synergies, we do have a number of products. Starting in our FY '14, FY '15, our Spine business put a lot of effort into revamping the product portfolio, and the products that are hitting the market now are Elevate Cage, for example, Voyager's another one. And this quarter, launching our new OLIF procedures. I'm calling them our second-generation OLIF procedures. We're getting a terrific uptick in these things. My only regret is that, 2 quarters ago, when we were planning, we didn't plan aggressively enough. And because I think we're hitting our maximum with sets. And if we had more sets, we'd even see more -- you could see more growth. So that's something we're factoring into our planning going forward as to be a little bit more aggressive. But both from a product standpoint and then from what we call Surgical Synergy standpoint, things are looking very good for our Spine business right now. And as you pointed out, every quarter, we've improved over the last 5 quarters. And it's a big shift, takes a little bit of time to kind of change the direction. And you should continue to see continued improvement quarter-over-quarter."

But -- so there's a couple of changes going on, and we'll get into this next week. But just a summary. One, moving into these different reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease state or condition versus technology. And the example I'll give is neuromodulation. I mean, that was a business largely held together based on technology, an implantable stimulator. And from whether it be Gastro/Uro, which we're now calling public health, or whether it be DBS or pain stim, they're all calling on different physicians, specialties, and we really felt we would get more traction if we organized by disease state versus by technology. So that's going to help us, one, focus on the physicians appropriately; and two, innovate. Because when we're innovating, we're looking across the disease state and across the care continuum, rather. So that's one change. And the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving to this general manager structure. So that gets to more execution, and this is something that the CVG has done over the last 4 years, 5 years, where you're having GMs that are 100% -- general managers are 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that they serve and those products within that therapy segment. And so making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular, so that's another component of that. And then along with this, we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG. And many of the leaders that are now running the group have -- are top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure, this disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and new players -- proven players from other areas in Medtronic, where we feel are very good as we hit FY '17."

It made a lot more sense to group that together with pain, where we have a lot of associated therapies, and we were missing the big picture look at pain by splitting up all the different, very significant nonopioid therapies that we had. And so this is really a disease-based look and a look at our customers, and that will drive innovation and will drive a clear picture of how we go to market with our sales force. And then it finally leads to value-based health care, driving for outcomes. That's the only way in which we're going to do it."

We actually built a small Surgical Synergy team, which is a bridge between that business and our Spine business and looking at an integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out, and that also works for DBS as well. So before, we had 2 separate businesses that weren't linked quite close enough, in my humble opinion, to drive the Surgical Synergy benefit. So we put a small team that includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition. So just in Q4 alone, we had 15 new kind of combined capital equipment, spine, core metal deals, which is significantly more than we've had in the prior 3 quarters combined, and this is something that is a result of that. And as we move forward, you'll see the technology roadmap more integrated. So we've actually built a little bit of a bridge between Spine and our capital equipment business."

But suffice it to say that our focus within type 2, first, the type 2 population is 90% of all patients with Diabetes. So it's a huge market opportunity. And when you take a look at those 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the route of insulin delivery because that's also a core competency. But insulin delivery within that type 2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%. The broader opportunity is within monitoring. And what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you're seeing with iPro2 and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions to those type 2 patients. And at the end, our goal isn't just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product. It's really to deliver an integrated solution to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insights and that can give those patients actionable information so that they can better manage their disease and also to do the same thing for physicians who are managing those patients. So we're really excited about the opportunity. As you said, we're just getting started. But we think there's a tremendous amount of runway in this business."

This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our exp",3460,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.27, growing 18% on a constant currency basis. 
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I'd like to recap fiscal 2016. FY '16 was a transformative year for our organization, our first full year after closing the largest-ever MedTech acquisition. It was a year where, in addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions, totaling $1.5 billion. It was a year where we launched a number of groundbreaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value-based health care. 
We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion, grew at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with strong progress against each of our 3 strategic pillars: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions. 
Our FY '16 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed on the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY '16 EPS leverage.
We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points, including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. We reinvested in R&D, organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any dilutive impact to EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of our long-term growth and market leadership. 
In FY '16, we untrapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increased our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, well above our minimum commitment of 50%. 
Despite our strong operational performance in FY '16, our non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4% after including the $0.47 negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, we do see this as largely outside our control and we feel that, over the long term, FX should balance itself out.
Now moving to our Q4 performance. 6% revenue growth was very strong, especially when considering this was built upon a 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY '15. We continue to outperform the market, and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in Diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG. 
Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our 3 growth sectors: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions.
In new therapies, we delivered above-goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 8%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF CryoAblation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. 
In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in High Power from the ongoing launch of the Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI Quad CRT-Ds. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control product. 
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker, 1/10 the size of a traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single-chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricle using proprietary detection algorithms, first developed for our highly successful Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder. 
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES drove sequential share gains in Europe and our Evolut R transcatheter aortic [ph] valve gained sequential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market. 
In APV, our Valiant Captivia Thoracic stent graft and Heli-FX EndoAnchor system drove above-market growth. Our IN.PACT [indiscernible].
Over the past 2 years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry-leading levels of internally driven R&D productivity across its businesses, and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is ahead for CVG at our Investor Day next week.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6%, led by strong above-market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; End Stage Renal Disease; and respiratory compromise. 
Open to MIS grew double digits in Q4, helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio, including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple technology and ValleyLab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double digits, with solid growth in our GI diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe. 
We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam COLON 2 capsule to potentially reach more patients at risk for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the upper single digits, benefiting from our capnography market development efforts. 
We also continue to make progress in bringing our new capital stream 35 [ph] to market in FY '17. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephew's highly profitable and fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We expect this acquisition to close this summer. 
We also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will touch upon later. Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at next week's Investor Day.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market, even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and Pipeline Shield in Europe continued to lead the market. 
In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging, driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy, a business annualizing at over $250 million, our Aquamantys System and PEAK PlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper teens growth. In Core Spine, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in the sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically, we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated OLIF procedures as well as from the recent Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. We're also realizing some early benefits from our Speed to Scale initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the entire market. 
Looking ahead, we're expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc in FY '17. Strong 7-year clinical outcome data on the 2-level PRESTIGE LP were presented earlier this month at AANS. 
As expected, we face challenges in our Neuromodulation division. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments, we're still experiencing double-digit revenue declines in our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for 4 quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward. 
In DBS and Pain Stim, we're facing increased competition. But as we look ahead, we're optimistic that drivers such as expanded early-onset DBS indication in the U.S. that we received earlier this year and new strategies that focus our pain strategies in the growing opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance, however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters. 
As we enter FY '17, we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus on the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally, we will report revenue results for 4 divisions comprising RTG: Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses; Brain Therapies, which includes our DBS, which we are now calling Brain Modulation, Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses; and Pain Therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and Intervention business.
[indiscernible] calling Pelvic Health, Advanced Energy and ENT will be reported externally as the Specialty Therapies division. 
As part of these changes, RTG is adopting the General Manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence of meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Geoff Martha will discuss these changes as well as additional details on his turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States, despite having anniversary-ed the launch of MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users' smartphone. 
Regarding our pipeline, we are on track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA before the end of June [ph]. Once launched, this will be the world's first hybrid closed loop system. 
Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider. UnitedHealthcare saw what others, including U.K.'s NICE, have seen, that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of our integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the health care system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidence-based outcomes. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schein and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm, Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our type 2 business. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are on track to launch Guardian Connect in Europe with the current Enhanced Enlite sensor in early FY '17 and in the U.S. with the next-generation sensor in the second half of FY '17. 
Guardian Connect allows us provide both type 1 and type 2 patients multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone professional CGM products with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our Diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth, and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week's Investor Day.
Our new product pipeline is robust across all 4 of our business groups, and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies' growth vector in the upper half of our 150 to 350 basis point goal. 
Next, let's turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. 
Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term.
In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper teens, and India and China grew in the low double digits. Next week at our Investor Day, you will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions. 
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model has expanded across all our business groups. 
In Care Management Services, formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high 20s in Q4, driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans' Administration Health Care System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as postacute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. 
In our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency, as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth in the high 50s. Since starting this business a little over 2 years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have management contracts with hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa. 
We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world and have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the Hospital Solutions model from cath labs into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We've already signed 10 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average lifespan of 7 years. 
We're also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management. One example is Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinical research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating 4 centers providing holistic diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. 
Their approach is highly successful, and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK's clinics to more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists in improving patient outcomes. Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK, as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we're uniquely positioning our business to focus on not just devices, but providing services and solutions across the care continuum. 
While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where business models will be based on measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers.
Turning now to the Q4 P&L. We grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18%, and EPS leverage was 1,210 basis points, both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies of over $100 million in the quarter were in line with our expectations, helped drive a 180 basis point improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. 
The combination of Covidien's synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 26 -- 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin included -- including the negative impact of currency, was 30.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. 
This was a result of 3 unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations; second, a 20 basis point impact from the onetime purchase accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory; and third, a 20 basis point impact from higher-than-anticipated scrap and obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to the bottom line. 
Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus on M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last June, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near term. 
Regarding share repurchases, in FY '16, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program, completing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY '16. We also continue to use our capital to make strategic and disciplined M&A investments, which must meet our portfolio criteria, namely: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. 
Before going to Gary, I'd like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of complex moving parts, our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication, teamwork and passion that our 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaken a strategy to transform health care. We don't take lightly the challenges this lofty goal places in our organization, and it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish. 
We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in health care to serve millions of patients around the globe, fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We're building on our track record of delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth. And with every quarter, we're increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. 
While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well on our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We're looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. 
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?"

Fourth quarter revenue of $7,567,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 6% on a constant currency basis, which excludes the $179 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 60 basis points to Q4 revenue growth. 
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8% with all 3 divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid-single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned. 
We have now started U.S. physician training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30s and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with Arctic Front Advance, following the compelling FIRE & ICE trial, which was featured as a late-breaker at ACC and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE & ICE trial on rates of rehospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late-breaking clinical trials at the Cardiostim Congress. 
In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitive launches due to our customers' increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, continuing enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of Resolute Integrity in the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multiline contracts in many geographies around the world. 
In transcatheter valves, we are seeing strong growth and expect this market to grow at $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3, from not having a large-sized Evolut R. We have started our Evolut R XL clinical, which is a 60-patient, 30-day follow-up trial. 
In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment of -- in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval, and we are moving into continued access for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. 
In Q4, we also saw a strong acceptance of CoreValve in Japan, following the first full quarter of launch. In Peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month at Charing Cross, including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions. 
We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement for predilatation and replacing it with simple, appropriate vessel preparation. These labeling changes now position Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales, grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S., and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter, with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus the 1% -- 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year. 
We are seeing stronger mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery market, while inpatient surgeries are growing in the low single digits. In PMR, quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer. 
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 3%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies and an improved results in Spine, which offset low single-digit declines in Neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1%, a large improvement over the past 2 quarters. We estimate the U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3%. So while we lost share year-over-year, we did gain over 100 basis points of share sequentially. 
We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe, we continue to be affected by the ship hold on our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue sometime during Q3 FY '17. 
In Neuromodulation, it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the intrathecal baclofen drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. 
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales, grew revenue 10%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions. It is worth noting that the Diabetes Group double-digit growth came in the face of a competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new businesses. 
Products like MiniMed 640G System with Enhanced Enlite sensor and SmartGuard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S., while our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies and Diabetes Services & Solutions divisions also contributed to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system, we believe there are sufficient drivers to continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our Diabetes Group.
Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78. 
In addition to the $348 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $118 million charge related to the retirement of $2.7 billion of debt, a $97 million net restructuring charge, an $85 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control. 
The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the onetime Bellco acquisition inventory step-up and negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis point constant currency improvement, which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.
Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4%, all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million, primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year. 
Regarding our earnings hedging program. While we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. 
Below the operating profit line, Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. 
In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt, utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was untrapped in a transaction last September. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximate $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our Interventional Spine business. 
In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to the timing on certain items, but we expect it to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. 
In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchased $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorizations to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416,000,000 shares. 
Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal -- initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. 
For FY '17, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis -- constant week basis, which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis point annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY '16. Assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 euro and a JPY 110, our FY '17 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 million to $75 million, with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year. 
In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% to 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency, constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative 6 percentage point impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY '16 as well as a negative $25 million to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately $225 million to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. 
While the expected FX impact on earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by an increased expected FX impact on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY '17 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY '16. For the first quarter of FY '17, we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant currency -- constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range. 
However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share growth to be slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar?"

But right now, I think it will be a slight negative, but mitigate, I should say, some of the operating leverage we're getting on a constant currency basis as we saw during the current year. So we would expect to see, again, on a constant currency basis, that would continue. But as reported, you're right. That might be less of an impact in Q1."

I think if you take a look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong. It was largely driven by OUS revenues and the 640G product, and I think it just shows you what kind of uptake we can get with a new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive. And here, we have a product that was launched in September of 2013. And so we don't have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe. But I think this underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said, is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse, and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues from emerging market revenues and from, call it, nontype 1 revenues with type 2 and Services & Solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next-generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results. The traction we're seeing in Europe and the feedback that we're seeing on our new pump platform is great. We expect to see that here in the United States once it's launched. So as we get the 670, we think there's going to be really strong uptick there. And as you heard from the commentary, things are on track with respect to that. And then finally, the last point I would make is that between now and when the next-generation pump comes up, Mike, we've got a lot of assets that we can leverage within the Diabetes business in the U.S. But the size of our sales force is the largest. The size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We've the largest scale and service infrastructure for patients. We've got deep and broad payer relationships. And on top of that, we've got a growing type 2 and solutions business here in the United States. So we feel good. Even though the competition continues to intensify in the U.S., we feel good that -- about our overall global performance.

But as we indicated previously when we announced the incremental buyback and if you watched historically, we tend to do that. We said we're going to be more front-end loaded on that.

And so -- but we're not getting specific about how much we're going to be including in that piece of it. So -- and as far as tax rate goes, I mean, there's obviously the benefit of the R&D tax credit catch up during the current year.

And that, in the short term, comes from the Covidien synergies. But what the Covidien synergies do, is it places a -- builds a platform for us, from which we can continue the same work. As we keep growing, taking advantage of our scale in our functional cost, primarily, we think we've got productivity that has a long tail. A long tail that we can continue to do. And in addition to that, our product cost reduction will also -- has good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number. Because we feel that, that would take longer than an initial 3-year period in the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risks. That's why we didn't jump into that. But what it does is it gives us a continued sustainability beyond the 3-year period. Those are the 2 main things.

And if there's not -- if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line, we would never have given such a tight range. I mean, the sorts of things that happen, there was no way we could have predicted them. And with things like the Bellco acquisition and its math, we hadn't really done that accurately because we just closed the acquisition like a week before we -- the earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became obvious and there were pressures. And it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term, and it's an extremely accretive kind of positive deal for us. But on an immediate 3-month basis, you can get surprises. So really, our guidance should have been more thought through, and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company because it's a company with a lot of assets and capabilities, and we think that it can grow mid-single digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders on a consistent basis.

As you said, we've tightened up a little bit from that and as far as where we're at. FX has been moving around. I mean, you look at it even just a few weeks ago, it was probably not $0.05 benefit from where we were talking about. It's going to be as much as another $0.03 or $0.04 higher than that. So -- but then the dollar strengthens again a little bit. So we're just -- we're being somewhat cautious because, as Omar said, FX has continued to be a headwind for us and we expect that in the next year. You're right. From an operating perspective, things are going very well. The revenue is strong. We're getting the operating leverage we would expect. But there's also lot of, still, moving parts. We have a lot of integration efforts we have to get done. We're going live with SAP in Europe for the Covidien entities this week. So it's -- there's just still a lot of moving parts, and we think the range we've given is consistent with what we communicated before and consistent with our long-term strategy."

And we need to, first, deliver that consistently before we talk about meaningful upside beyond that. Like I've mentioned in previous calls, what will trigger, any thought of consistently delivering over that would be if we sort of overachieved on each of our growth drivers, new therapies, Services & Solutions and emerging markets for a few quarters in a row. Only then we'll have confidence that more than 6% is sustainable. You'll get the odd quarter where we do, do better, but you will get some pressures on other quarters. So I don't want to bank on that yet. Like you said, it is a tight range and something that we, internally did debate about. But given trends and the fact that we've been holding that level of performance over a significant period of time, sort of makes us feel reasonably confident that it's something that we can achieve.

And we find that, overall, our operating margin dollars go up significantly as a result of these transactions. So -- and then as we go forward, we expect to see productivity from those Services & Solutions arrangements, both from the services themselves, but also from hopefully lower cost of sales in some of those accounts for support sales. That's the way we're looking at it. It's something that we feel that we have to cover in our overall model and yet deliver the EPS that we are talking about. And that's where we're focused on and use every other variable that we have to cover for that because we do think that the Services & Solutions gives us a sustainable long-term growth, which was very sticky.

A much greater growth in the MIS procedures versus open, and this is pretty consistent when I look at other players in the marketplace and I look at their revenue growth in the quarter. So I'm really happy about that. And truthfully, that's probably the bigger opportunity, a small uptick in surgical volumes in the U.S. versus a real change in mix shift to MIS, I'll go with the mix shift to MIS all day long. And that's pretty consistent again with what we've seen, what our reps are telling us and what we're seeing from other companies that are playing in the same space.

That is, I'll call it, one leg of a multipronged strategy around what we call Surgical Synergies. And we feel, as we move out into the future, these Surgical Synergies will be in Spine, our calling card. We have got very strong enabling technology platforms in navigation and imaging.

And then integrating these platforms as we move forward to provide a -- to differentiate spine procedures, both economically and clinically, and the surgeon experience, low radiation, just an easier surgical procedures, et cetera, we think is going to differentiate our Spine business. And so as you move forward, and this is going to -- this is not -- this isn't 5 years from now. This is going to take place quarter-over-quarter as we continue to emphasize this. So this is something we're very excited about. And as we move forward, outside of Surgical Synergies, we do have a number of products. Starting in our FY '14, FY '15, our Spine business put a lot of effort into revamping the product portfolio, and the products that are hitting the market now are Elevate Cage, for example, Voyager's another one. And this quarter, launching our new OLIF procedures. I'm calling them our second-generation OLIF procedures. We're getting a terrific uptick in these things. My only regret is that, 2 quarters ago, when we were planning, we didn't plan aggressively enough. And because I think we're hitting our maximum with sets. And if we had more sets, we'd even see more -- you could see more growth. So that's something we're factoring into our planning going forward as to be a little bit more aggressive. But both from a product standpoint and then from what we call Surgical Synergy standpoint, things are looking very good for our Spine business right now. And as you pointed out, every quarter, we've improved over the last 5 quarters. And it's a big shift, takes a little bit of time to kind of change the direction.

But -- so there's a couple of changes going on, and we'll get into this next week. But just a summary. One, moving into these different reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease state or condition versus technology. And the example I'll give is neuromodulation. I mean, that was a business largely held together based on technology, an implantable stimulator. And from whether it be Gastro/Uro, which we're now calling public health, or whether it be DBS or pain stim, they're all calling on different physicians, specialties, and we really felt we would get more traction if we organized by disease state versus by technology. So that's going to help us, one, focus on the physicians appropriately; and two, innovate. Because when we're innovating, we're looking across the disease state and across the care continuum, rather. So that's one change. And the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving to this general manager structure. So that gets to more execution, and this is something that the CVG has done over the last 4 years, 5 years, where you're having GMs that are 100% -- general managers are 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that they serve and those products within that therapy segment. And so making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular, so that's another component of that. And then along with this, we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG. And many of the leaders that are now running the group have -- are top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure, this disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and new players -- proven players from other areas in Medtronic, where we feel are very good as we hit FY '17."

It made a lot more sense to group that together with pain, where we have a lot of associated therapies, and we were missing the big picture look at pain by splitting up all the different, very significant nonopioid therapies that we had. And so this is really a disease-based look and a look at our customers, and that will drive innovation and will drive a clear picture of how we go to market with our sales force.

We actually built a small Surgical Synergy team, which is a bridge between that business and our Spine business and looking at an integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out, and that also works for DBS as well. So before, we had 2 separate businesses that weren't linked quite close enough, in my humble opinion, to drive the Surgical Synergy benefit. So we put a small team that includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition. So just in Q4 alone, we had 15 new kind of combined capital equipment, spine, core metal deals, which is significantly more than we've had in the prior 3 quarters combined, and this is something that is a result of that.

And when you take a look at those 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the route of insulin delivery because that's also a core competency. But insulin delivery within that type 2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%. The broader opportunity is within monitoring. And what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you're seeing with iPro2 and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions to those type 2 patients. And at the end, our goal isn't just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product. It's really to deliver an integrated solution to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insights and that can give those patients actionable information so that they can better manage their disease and also to do the same thing for physicians who are managing those patients.

If you think about it, the card business globally generates about $1 out of every $4 roughly in both revenue, earnings, $130 billion of loans, about $18 billion in revenues.",807,"Sure, sure. So let's start with a lot of money and returns, because I like that. If you think about it, the card business globally generates about $1 out of every $4 roughly in both revenue, earnings, $130 billion of loans, about $18 billion in revenues. So from a scale perspective, it is a very important contributor just in terms of its size. Second is, as you mentioned, returns and efficiency. So the operating efficiency of this business, think cost-to-income or expense-to-income ratio, runs at below 45%. I think many of you know what our targets are, they're well north of that, about 1,000 basis points north of that. So it plays an important role of highly efficient businesses here. And then third, the returns are very attractive. I think first quarter, we talked about a target somewhere between 2% and 2.5% return on assets. So think 2.25%, that's on assets. On capital, you can appreciate a kind of similar phenomena, so we're roughly at least 2x what the target is for the company. So from a contribution standpoint, financially, I also think about this business as -- this is a sharp edge of the wedge that can help us soar [ph] the brand because the consumer product and the card product, in particular, is a high-engagement product. It's something that builds a high degree of emotional as well as kind of rational connection. And so to me, it's another piece that's important for the enterprise overall. I guess that's a kind of 2-part question. The word you used was franchise, which is a word I like a lot. Before we get into any particular market, the thing that we realized and pushed very hard on when I first arrived was that we were running what was really a loose federation of local banks. And so across, think close to 40 markets, that -- when you've got a global footprint like ours and one that is unique, distinct and very tough to replicate, that underplays a huge leverage you have in running a global business. And so we quickly put in a bunch of management routines, not just in terms -- if you think good franchises, they set strategy, they handle investment prioritizations, they set operating principles, and I can go into what those look like. They set performance standards, so think even risk appetite ratios. That's what a good franchise does. And a lot of that was, frankly, missing. The second thing is we quickly set out to say, okay, that's kind of a halibut. What we want to do is massively reduce the complexity of the products, that's why we have over 800 products. So moving from a very complex, highly fragmented product set, not only because of the complexity and, thereby, cost and control issues, but if you're going to stand for something, you got to do it on scale, and you have to do it across markets. So we can talk a bit about not just the simplifying, but also then standardizing products, which I'd be glad to get into. The second was we had 11 different reward programs in this business. Certainly, as you're going after and prospecting for emerging affluent and affluent, [indiscernible] write the words [indiscernible] is absolutely critical. We had 11 different platforms. In 50% of the market, you had to call in to redeem, there's no online redemption. But today, over 90% of the card's revenue in markets, we have a consistent comp global rewards platform, ThankYou platform that many of you may know here in the States. And it's not only from a control standpoint, but think about it from building that brand and, frankly, from negotiations. So we have a chance to then go to global partners. We've got about 20 of them, they're 160 in total, where I can go on and say, if you want to do a program in Hilton Hotels and do an offer in Singapore, in the U.S., in Mexico, I can light it up with the same tools, and obviously, it gives me considerable volume clout. And then lastly, networks. So we had, I think, over 50 different contracts with the different networks: Visa, MasterCard, AmEx. We even had some -- a legacy Discover -- I'm sorry, not Discover, Diners. Although when I got there, there was a discussion whether we should be doing a deal with Diners, and I said, ""This is madness,"" and we negotiated a single contract with one provider, MasterCard, that unlocked billions of dollars of value but more importantly, gives us a very important seat as we begin to look at the role networks play going into the future. So to me, it's, from an enterprise perspective, an important financial contributor, important brand driver but also important in demonstrating how you run a global business."

I think if I disaggregate it by region and think -- break out the U.S., Asia and Mexico, in the U.S., first off, even if I thought I was done, I would never say publicly I'm done because I never want the organization to get complacent and believe we're done. And I still think there's -- from a product set in the U.S., we've got the right combination, because as you think about these businesses, it's like any investment portfolio, you're constantly thinking about how you rebalance your portfolio. And these are simply different asset classes that do different things: co-brands versus proprietary cards. Within proprietary cards, cards that's are focused on high-end transactors versus prime revolvers. And how we -- that efficient frontier that we use to optimize our mix when we're thinking acquisition campaigns and how you then drive outcomes that will be clear 2 to 3 years from now, that -- I felt like I've got the right product set, and it's -- those product lines are now chassis that we've rolled out. So Prestige, which is top of the line for ThankYou, we have in 13 markets around the globe; Simplicity, we have in 5 different markets, ultimate high-end markets; Card in Asia [ph], we have in 5 premier miles. So we're building out the chassis in a way that I feel good about. In terms of capabilities, though, these are businesses that are analytically derived [indiscernible]. I think from -- people joke about Big Data now. This has been a big business that's been Big Data for decades, and I can give you plenty of stories. To me, the lack of analytic rigor around risk and decision science we've built up that I also feel very good about, that's something that can transport globally. Servicing, we talked about going from a customer satisfaction of whopping 0 to now well over 50%. And our digital servicing, which was lagging both phone as well as even IVR, is now ahead of both of those, so we got digital servicing on the right path. So in the U.S., it's the place to invest and, certainly, to compete. And I think if you look at our numbers for the first quarter, our sales were up 12%, and so we're clearly picking up share. Asia, I would say, is also in a good place with respect to product. When I think product, I think, not just the actual offering but the embedded servicing that goes along with it is in a good place. To me, the real opportunity there is actually in digital acquisition. We acquire over 50% of our cards in the U.S. through digital channels. In Asia, it's well south of that. Think closer to 0 than 50%. And in Asia, as many of you know, a lot of these products are sold through a direct sales agent and a variety of different mechanisms. So the opportunity, it's not just a cost arbitrage, the ability to take the -- it's not like folks in Asia don't walk around with smartphones. Here in the States, our e-mails -- 3/4 of our emails are opened up on a smartphone today. In the U.S., when somebody's shopping for a card, 2/3 of them go on their mobile device to shop before they actually end up applying. All the tools we built -- so the decision sites, the targeting for digital, how you set the right offer to the right person, how you build search optimization, all that stuff is independently transferable. So to me, that's a huge opportunity. And then it's just a question of our ability to invest in Asia, to get the growth. So first quarter, I know John talked about the fact that we feel confident where Asia is headed, that some of the -- it's been a market that's gone through a lot of regulatory change. So think everything from rate caps to interchange regulation, to just restrictions on lending overall. And so Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, all have been hit. And there's still some stuff out there. Indonesia we can talk about, but frankly, that grover [ph] should be a bit easier and it's the right set of products. In Mexico, I'd say, we -- as a firm, we have conviction on Mexico for all the economy. But I will also say within Mexico, it's a little bit like we were in the U.S. and making sure that Mexico had such a dominant powerful branch footprint and had such commanding share, how we make that business forward compatible on everything from risk and fraud to digital acquisition. So that's kind of a long thesis on that one."

It was evident a couple of years ago that when I looked at the cash back product that we had in the marketplace, not a good product, not performing well, frankly, not economical. No amount of kind of reverse engineering of the existing base was going to make a ton of sense. Secondly, 8 out of 10 households in the U.S. had some form of a cash back product. And so in my mind, we weren't even participating. At that point, I'd turn off acquisition of cash back. And then third, to me, any good consumer business has to be maniacal about who the design target is and what you can uncover that's a human truth that somehow you think you can tap in a way that creates something that's unique and valued and perhaps differentiated and tough to replicate. This one was fascinating. You have to listen to prime revolvers. And so no big surprise that you can have a barbell strategy. You can bring in high-wallet transactors that do a lot for that portfolio in terms of its loss and then risk-weighted assets but also prime revolvers that you can build a deep profitable win. And what they said was, ""We don’t have a card that works for us. Those reward products don't work for us because we never build up enough points that we can get an airline ticket."" And that's kind of the mentality of, it's the airline ticket. So no amount of lower-cost redemption really was working their mind emotionally. What they said was, ""What we're doing is we're borrowing temporarily and then paying back, but we get no reward for paying back,"" which when you think about a payments business, that's what we're in the business of doing, getting paid, not just on the spend or the loan volume. And so the whole notion of 1% when you spend and 1% when you pay just resonated unbelievably. The other was that the feedback we have, the products have so much gimme-try [ph] to it, so many asterisks, so many -- feels like trip wires. You have to sign up every quarter. It's a revolving this or -- and so every time you think you got it figured out, it changes on you. Or that resorts to a lot of kind of acquisition bonus scene and certain things, but then after that first year, it dies off. And so our modeling was all built around if you simplify the language, if you make it -- you've probably seen ads that are running right now in terms of double cash what it means, double cash, taking all the junk out and just simplifying that offer. And then the economics are, what's the right balance you've got between transactors and revolvers. The second piece I will point out that is evident in the marketplace, we do absolutely no acquisition bonusing. So everybody we compete against has anywhere from $100 to $200 acquisition bonuses out there. Secondly, a vast majority of these cards are coming in through online channels because we built them for acquisition. That's a far cheaper channel to acquire. That doesn't mean they're not doing direct mail, but it's the channel this thing is built for. And that actually pops unbelievably on a bunch of different sites because of the nature of that proposition. And it's built for online, and I'll leave it at that. And then lastly, it rides on the high tier largely of Mastercard interchange because of the overall spend characteristics. So those are kind of factor inputs that as you guys are putting through models might give you some idea of how things might be a little bit different."

Several years ago, as we were, in fact, at a conference like this not so long ago, talked about, first we had to fix the basics and everything from just risk and fraud models and the like. The next was build -- simplifying it, radically simplifying and build out the right product proposition, starting with proprietary. And then I brought in some industry consultants. Folks may know of -- folks that do these RFPs for co-brand that -- so they do these RFPs for co-brands, but they kind of work from one to another. And I brought them in to evaluate how we were construed as a co-brand player. And they came back, and you could see kind of the averted eyes and shuffled feet, and I said, ""My management team's here. I want you to give an unvarnished view."" And they said, ""Nobody really knows where you are in co-brands."" This is Citi. Citi used to be a powerhouse in co-brands. Secondly, the management team that you built from a bunch of different players that are not Citi but know co-brands really well, and so individuals on your team know them very well by both the consultants and many of the [indiscernible], but you're not even being asked. And it was a little act of kind of shame everybody into, okay, now it's time to play to win. And we put together a list that suits and others know well of here's the different verticals that you can play in, here's how the economics work from a travel, airline different than hotel, retailer different than x, and here are the principles we're going to put in place. One is we've got to play on scale. That seemed to me people trying to do the old MD&As, string of pearls, and what you end up with is something highly customized and way too costly. We work well on scale. The second one, as you pointed out, it had to be brand accretive. So something that we look at that says this is a brand we want to be associated with and they, too, with us. The third was that it's got to have a loyalty program that stands for something and distribution capabilities, because in essence, that's what I'm paying a fee for entry on. So both the distribution capabilities outside of my acquisition channels and an incredible membership base. There's a bunch of other considerations about financial stability and others which you can fully appreciate in a risk model like ours, but those were the basics. And we kept winnowing and winnowing down the list. And the thing that was evident in the portfolio review is we did [indiscernible]. Brian Leach who was the Chief Risk Officer when I first got there, I said, striking -- this is, Brian, like any other investment portfolio, you got to rebalance the assets, and we haven't done that. And so the balance between proprietary and co-brand is not in the right place, and we're heavy on travel portfolios, so airline and hotels. So when you think Expedia, Hilton and American. So Costco became easy to see, hard to even think there was going to be a possible -- another anchor tenant. And now that we add them, if you think about it, high-spending portfolio, low losses and some are specs performs more like an airline co-brand than just about anything else, and a brand -- I mean, #2 retailer, and a brand that is incredibly disciplined, they're incredibly clear about what they stand for, a management team that I know very well, that I've seen them stand behind not just the negotiations but also how they invest in this product with us."

So that any of the kind of guidance on returns, this is what the portfolio should perform at when you have these run through your numbers. What I can also say is that we've been very clear that this is a deal that hit all of our hurdles right from the start. There was no assumption about DTA that was kind of -- we had a set of principles that we can't run P&Ls based on DTA consumption and hit the hurdles, and not the hurdles only for that deal, but what it does to the portfolio short, medium and long term over the course of a long-term contract. The other piece I'll add is that when you have the right kind of partner, so if you think about these offers, 4% back on gas, 3% on travel, entertainment, 2% in Costco, and I can tell you, the CEO, Craig Jelinek, was involved, not -- even down to the plastic design, which I love, there's at some point where you say, ""Look, I know this part of the business pretty well.""

I think folks have been pretty clear at AmEx that they couldn't find a way to make the economics work. I think that's probably one part of the equation, but anytime you've seen a sales organization lose something, it's either the rules weren't fair or the other guys priced it out because more to it than simply price. The second thing is that, as you look, they've been pretty public about holding on to parts of that portfolio, so I think that will play out over the next year, we'll see how that goes. The third is that there's pent-up demand. So Costco and AmEx have not been acquiring new customers all this year. So think about that. Think about the pent-up demand that folks that are looking at. They also may see a 4, 3, 2, 1 with a very different product value that's clearly in a [indiscernible]. You look at just the cycle we set up alone, the hits that we're getting on it, we haven't released any numbers, it's pretty astounding, and the amount of plastic that we've already produced in the hands of Costco customers who are calling us to register because they can't activate yet because it's not an active card until June 20, but once they have registered, it will be. And so there's pent-up demand, and the other phase, it's going to be just an interesting play. And I couldn't give you any guidance on how to model it, but it used to be just AmEx. And for the primary, it was AmEx. If you think about it, now it's Visa. Now is that a good thing or a bad thing for us? If you have a Visa card, you can go into Costco now and shop. You need a Costco membership. And one could say, boy, maybe that's -- how do I figure out the interchange that it's going to be paid on that card in Costco on a Visa card? But how do I think about it since the Costco card member has got a card, they go in and use their Visa card, is that, boy, a damage to our assumptions and our model or actually, is it one of the greatest prospecting tools I've got to have a wave of Visa card members come in. And I encourage anybody to go visit a Costco store -- don't do it June 20 or 21, but in the subsequent weeks and see what that process is for signing up because I can tell you, I have an immense amount of confidence in Costco's operational excellence, and I can't say how much time we spend on what it looks like entering that store, walking through the store, the Wi-Fi that's going to be boosted, the iPads that are going to be in people's hands. So I think it's going to be an interesting one to see. But I certainly am not looking to [indiscernible] the plans of how it just stays static. Understood?

Interesting to have to work both sides of that trade. Also, building middle-market products for American for that other card, and so that it's a highly desired, sought-after portfolio. When I arrived, I was distressed, to be honest, about the nature of the relationship. It felt like almost all of our co-brand relationships were driven by the contract, oftentimes managed by more lawyers than commercially oriented folks. I can tell you that one co-brand, which will remain nameless, was managed by the Intellectual Property division of the General Counsel's office. That's not a way to build a commercial relationship. Like lawyers in the room, but like the business people make in the final calls. I'd tell you right now, if you were to ask the American folks, the commercial relationship has never been better. If you look at -- since we don’t break out the portfolio, you can't look at. But the investments -- probably the easiest way to look at it, is the investments that we've made, so investments, when they were going through bankruptcy, the investments we've made when they were merging with U.S. Air, investments we've made in new products that were quite a lot, investments we've made in their lounges to kind of own those places. So I would -- while we don’t break out the performance, I think the commercial relationship is the strongest it's ever been. And I think the interesting piece over the negotiation period of which I think we've signaled that, in fact, we feel pretty close to getting something done, but nothing is done until it's done. And that for whatever portfolio of statements we've made, we've worked assumptions then to those statements about the portfolio that are consistent with a revised deal with different economics. And I know Jamie and Gordon have been probably the 2 most public in terms of what it means to their re-upping with some of the airlines."

But think that -- think about these as 2 anchor tenants that have some very similar dynamics. And so when I said different asset classes, what in a co-brand you typically pay for is the loyalty program and distribution, so cost per mile as an example, and bounties on acquisition typically structured that way. Similar kind of notion within a Costco and many co-brands. So you have a cost per point that tends to be higher than a proprietary product. You also -- when you have a high-spending portfolio, you tend to have lower losses, but they both have very attractive lending portfolios associated with them. And I think you heard AmEx describe briefly not just the number of cards but also what percent of their loan portfolio that was. So think about these as kind of comparable anchors but have slightly different dynamics based on macroeconomic environment. I'd love to go deeper but obviously there's no time."

Secondly, when you want an acceptance network, you want an acceptance network that is broad. That's one of the reasons, speculate, that Costco went to Visa, just simply more coverage. In that, there's also belief that -- I think Costco would tell you that they believe that the ability to attract customers onto their product in their warehouse is awfully high. The next is to your question thesis, so on an earlier career, I had ended up with a portfolio that had a lot of in-warehouse sales. And we built something that had a very different reward mechanism that drove that 70%. I'd tell you the reason it drove the 70% is because it was Costco loyalists who love that check at the beginning of next year, when they can go in and they can go shopping for free. So much like airline reward junkies, in terms of how they think about their bank, Costco loyalists are the same. And they're getting incented for gas purchases, for travel, for entertainment, not just Costco spend. The more spend they have on the card, the bigger that check is at the beginning of the next year."

So whether it's acquiring new customers, the cost of serve existing, the embedded cost of fraud and the like. So this is on -- and having an earlier life on customer service and operations, I look at these as massive transactio",840,"Yes, it's a great question. So whether it's acquiring new customers, the cost of serve existing, the embedded cost of fraud and the like. So this is on -- and having an earlier life on customer service and operations, I look at these as massive transaction processing businesses. The first and foremost customer service businesses that generate an immense amount of information exhaust. And if you know how to use that information exhaust, which we may get into, the ability to use machine learning in this business is just massive. Banks don't talk about it a lot, a lot of folks down in Silicon Valley don't talk about it anymore, I think there's some more that needs to be done there. But in terms of the [indiscernible], it's -- for an engineer, it's an engineer's delight because the ability to identify scrap and bad input that happens in these big processes is massive. And so to me, my expectation is anywhere from 5% to -- and this is the rate and volume game. And without getting too deep into it, constantly looking at unit cost, and so from operations, I'm confidently looking for at least a 5% to 10% improvement in that unit cost every year. And that's just efficiency. And then whether it's operations or take acquisition, there's the effectiveness measure as well. So part of it is just bad volume, bad input. But the other is that how do I build better targeting models so that, in fact, I'm not making that offer to that person, I think, has a higher probability of either future default but more importantly, even just responding, particularly in digital channels, which is kind of -- it feels like it's the direct response equivalent of the kind of male version 1990s kind of thing, how you build because the signals within digital data are just very different than how direct mail operated 2 decades ago. And that figuring out that signal-to-noise ratio and how other data can be used, so constantly looking for both improvement and rate. And then constantly looking for volumes, which is -- so within our service center, our call volumes have come down dramatically, and so I get a benefit there as well, not just on rate, because [indiscernible] nothing will be gained on, hey, my costs are coming down. I see both rate and volume because as we move to digital servicing, not only it's faster, better, cheaper, it's not just about cost arbitrage, I know, and this is where I think Fintechs have done a great job of challenging the model of how banks serve. I say to the teams, it's kind of like we didn't want to be the clamshell packaging the consumer products companies use, anybody buy like a -- just over the weekend, I bought a razor, I won't name the brand, trying to get it open, I cut myself. By the time I've opened the razor, I'm so angry at the product and the company, and said, look at -- banks can easily become the clamshells or, actually, how do you think about creating that service experience that's so much simpler, so much easier. I think that's where Fintech has kind of disaggregated the parts and raised the game. So that, to me, is kind of the next challenge. So if I think about where I spend my time, it's more around digital acquiring, digital servicing and then digital spend, the e-commerce spend, and not tap and pay, I'm talking e-commerce, where there's $2 trillion of spend this year. And then on fraud, again, it's -- when I first arrived, the story I got from the head of fraud was we got world-class fraud. So what do you measure? He said, fraud losses. So what else do you measure? Fraud losses. I said, ""That's it?"" ""Yes, that's it. I manage fraud."" The scariest answer I had ever been given. I got into what the system was, and it was 1,800 rules that fired off sequentially in a world where no networks are being built for this stuff. So to me, it's about the total cost of ownership, and we quickly replatformed -- not quickly, it took 1.5 years, to a SaaS platform that nobody had, at that point, used and brought in the decision modelers. And our fraud now is not something I talk publicly about because I never want to put a bull's eye on it, but I would say that we're best-in-class. And it's not just at losses, it is also about think at the point-of-sale that false-positive where you decline somebody because they're traveling overseas or they look like a likely suspect. And I'd say that our false-positive declines are now at or better than industry -- certainly better than industry average and close to who I consider to be the leader. So to me, it's not just a cost play, it's about effectiveness and making sure you've got the full set of spectrum of performance metrics around these processes."

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. 
Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015, respectively, and all quarterly year-over-year growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. All annual year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, in addition to adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency translation, includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak."

This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our exp",3460,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.27, growing 18% on a constant currency basis. 
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I'd like to recap fiscal 2016. FY '16 was a transformative year for our organization, our first full year after closing the largest-ever MedTech acquisition. It was a year where, in addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions, totaling $1.5 billion. It was a year where we launched a number of groundbreaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value-based health care. 
We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion, grew at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with strong progress against each of our 3 strategic pillars: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions. 
Our FY '16 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed on the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY '16 EPS leverage.
We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points, including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. We reinvested in R&D, organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any dilutive impact to EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of our long-term growth and market leadership. 
In FY '16, we untrapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increased our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, well above our minimum commitment of 50%. 
Despite our strong operational performance in FY '16, our non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4% after including the $0.47 negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, we do see this as largely outside our control and we feel that, over the long term, FX should balance itself out.
Now moving to our Q4 performance. 6% revenue growth was very strong, especially when considering this was built upon a 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY '15. We continue to outperform the market, and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in Diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG. 
Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid-single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our 3 growth sectors: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions.
In new therapies, we delivered above-goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 8%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF CryoAblation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons. 
In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in High Power from the ongoing launch of the Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI Quad CRT-Ds. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control product. 
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker, 1/10 the size of a traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single-chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricle using proprietary detection algorithms, first developed for our highly successful Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder. 
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES drove sequential share gains in Europe and our Evolut R transcatheter aortic [ph] valve gained sequential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market. 
In APV, our Valiant Captivia Thoracic stent graft and Heli-FX EndoAnchor system drove above-market growth. Our IN.PACT [indiscernible].
Over the past 2 years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry-leading levels of internally driven R&D productivity across its businesses, and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is ahead for CVG at our Investor Day next week.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6%, led by strong above-market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; End Stage Renal Disease; and respiratory compromise. 
Open to MIS grew double digits in Q4, helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio, including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple technology and ValleyLab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double digits, with solid growth in our GI diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe. 
We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam COLON 2 capsule to potentially reach more patients at risk for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the upper single digits, benefiting from our capnography market development efforts. 
We also continue to make progress in bringing our new capital stream 35 [ph] to market in FY '17. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephew's highly profitable and fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We expect this acquisition to close this summer. 
We also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will touch upon later. Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at next week's Investor Day.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market, even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and Pipeline Shield in Europe continued to lead the market. 
In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging, driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy, a business annualizing at over $250 million, our Aquamantys System and PEAK PlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper teens growth. In Core Spine, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in the sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically, we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated OLIF procedures as well as from the recent Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. We're also realizing some early benefits from our Speed to Scale initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the entire market. 
Looking ahead, we're expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc in FY '17. Strong 7-year clinical outcome data on the 2-level PRESTIGE LP were presented earlier this month at AANS. 
As expected, we face challenges in our Neuromodulation division. While we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments, we're still experiencing double-digit revenue declines in our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for 4 quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward. 
In DBS and Pain Stim, we're facing increased competition. But as we look ahead, we're optimistic that drivers such as expanded early-onset DBS indication in the U.S. that we received earlier this year and new strategies that focus our pain strategies in the growing opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance, however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters. 
As we enter FY '17, we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus on the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally, we will report revenue results for 4 divisions comprising RTG: Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses; Brain Therapies, which includes our DBS, which we are now calling Brain Modulation, Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses; and Pain Therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and Intervention business.
[indiscernible] calling Pelvic Health, Advanced Energy and ENT will be reported externally as the Specialty Therapies division. 
As part of these changes, RTG is adopting the General Manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence of meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Geoff Martha will discuss these changes as well as additional details on his turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States, despite having anniversary-ed the launch of MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users' smartphone. 
Regarding our pipeline, we are on track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA before the end of June [ph]. Once launched, this will be the world's first hybrid closed loop system. 
Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider. UnitedHealthcare saw what others, including U.K.'s NICE, have seen, that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of our integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the health care system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidence-based outcomes. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schein and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm, Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our type 2 business. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are on track to launch Guardian Connect in Europe with the current Enhanced Enlite sensor in early FY '17 and in the U.S. with the next-generation sensor in the second half of FY '17. 
Guardian Connect allows us provide both type 1 and type 2 patients multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our stand-alone professional CGM products with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution. While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our Diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth, and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week's Investor Day.
Our new product pipeline is robust across all 4 of our business groups, and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies' growth vector in the upper half of our 150 to 350 basis point goal. 
Next, let's turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. 
Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term.
In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper teens, and India and China grew in the low double digits. Next week at our Investor Day, you will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions. 
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model has expanded across all our business groups. 
In Care Management Services, formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high 20s in Q4, driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans' Administration Health Care System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as postacute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. 
In our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise and operational efficiency, as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth in the high 50s. Since starting this business a little over 2 years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have management contracts with hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa. 
We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world and have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the Hospital Solutions model from cath labs into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We've already signed 10 operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average lifespan of 7 years. 
We're also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management. One example is Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinical research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating 4 centers providing holistic diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. 
Their approach is highly successful, and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK's clinics to more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists in improving patient outcomes. Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK, as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we're uniquely positioning our business to focus on not just devices, but providing services and solutions across the care continuum. 
While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based health care offerings, where business models will be based on measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payers.
Turning now to the Q4 P&L. We grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18%, and EPS leverage was 1,210 basis points, both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies of over $100 million in the quarter were in line with our expectations, helped drive a 180 basis point improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. 
The combination of Covidien's synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 26 -- 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin included -- including the negative impact of currency, was 30.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. 
This was a result of 3 unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations; second, a 20 basis point impact from the onetime purchase accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory; and third, a 20 basis point impact from higher-than-anticipated scrap and obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to the bottom line. 
Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus on M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last June, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near term. 
Regarding share repurchases, in FY '16, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program, completing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY '16. We also continue to use our capital to make strategic and disciplined M&A investments, which must meet our portfolio criteria, namely: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution. 
Before going to Gary, I'd like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of complex moving parts, our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication, teamwork and passion that our 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaken a strategy to transform health care. We don't take lightly the challenges this lofty goal places in our organization, and it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish. 
We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in health care to serve millions of patients around the globe, fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We're building on our track record of delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth. And with every quarter, we're increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. 
While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well on our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We're looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. 
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?"

Fourth quarter revenue of $7,567,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 6% on a constant currency basis, which excludes the $179 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 60 basis points to Q4 revenue growth. 
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8% with all 3 divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid-single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned. 
We have now started U.S. physician training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30s and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with Arctic Front Advance, following the compelling FIRE & ICE trial, which was featured as a late-breaker at ACC and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE & ICE trial on rates of rehospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late-breaking clinical trials at the Cardiostim Congress. 
In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitive launches due to our customers' increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, continuing enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of Resolute Integrity in the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multiline contracts in many geographies around the world. 
In transcatheter valves, we are seeing strong growth and expect this market to grow at $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3, from not having a large-sized Evolut R. We have started our Evolut R XL clinical, which is a 60-patient, 30-day follow-up trial. 
In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment of -- in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval, and we are moving into continued access for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. 
In Q4, we also saw a strong acceptance of CoreValve in Japan, following the first full quarter of launch. In Peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month at Charing Cross, including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions. 
We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement for predilatation and replacing it with simple, appropriate vessel preparation. These labeling changes now position Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales, grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S., and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter, with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus the 1% -- 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year. 
We are seeing stronger mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery market, while inpatient surgeries are growing in the low single digits. In PMR, quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer. 
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 3%, with strong growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies and an improved results in Spine, which offset low single-digit declines in Neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1%, a large improvement over the past 2 quarters. We estimate the U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3%. So while we lost share year-over-year, we did gain over 100 basis points of share sequentially. 
We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe, we continue to be affected by the ship hold on our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue sometime during Q3 FY '17. 
In Neuromodulation, it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the intrathecal baclofen drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. 
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales, grew revenue 10%, with strong broad-based performance across all 3 divisions. It is worth noting that the Diabetes Group double-digit growth came in the face of a competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new businesses. 
Products like MiniMed 640G System with Enhanced Enlite sensor and SmartGuard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S., while our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies and Diabetes Services & Solutions divisions also contributed to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system, we believe there are sufficient drivers to continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our Diabetes Group.
Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78. 
In addition to the $348 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $118 million charge related to the retirement of $2.7 billion of debt, a $97 million net restructuring charge, an $85 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control. 
The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the onetime Bellco acquisition inventory step-up and negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis point constant currency improvement, which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.
Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4%, all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million, primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year. 
Regarding our earnings hedging program. While we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. 
Below the operating profit line, Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. 
In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt, utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was untrapped in a transaction last September. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximate $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our Interventional Spine business. 
In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to the timing on certain items, but we expect it to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. 
In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchased $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorizations to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416,000,000 shares. 
Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal -- initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. 
For FY '17, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis -- constant week basis, which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis point annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY '16. Assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 euro and a JPY 110, our FY '17 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 million to $75 million, with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year. 
In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% to 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency, constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative 6 percentage point impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY '16 as well as a negative $25 million to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately $225 million to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. 
While the expected FX impact on earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by an increased expected FX impact on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY '17 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY '16. For the first quarter of FY '17, we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant currency -- constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range. 
However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share growth to be slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar?"

I think if you take a look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong. It was largely driven by OUS revenues and the 640G product, and I think it just shows you what kind of uptake we can get with a new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive. And here, we have a product that was launched in September of 2013. And so we don't have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe. But I think this underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said, is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse, and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues from emerging market revenues and from, call it, nontype 1 revenues with type 2 and Services & Solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next-generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results. The traction we're seeing in Europe and the feedback that we're seeing on our new pump platform is great. We expect to see that here in the United States once it's launched. So as we get the 670, we think there's going to be really strong uptick there. And as you heard from the commentary, things are on track with respect to that. And then finally, the last point I would make is that between now and when the next-generation pump comes up, Mike, we've got a lot of assets that we can leverage within the Diabetes business in the U.S. But the size of our sales force is the largest. The size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We've the largest scale and service infrastructure for patients. We've got deep and broad payer relationships. And on top of that, we've got a growing type 2 and solutions business here in the United States. So we feel good. Even though the competition continues to intensify in the U.S., we feel good that -- about our overall global performance.

So that expectation, we do expect, as we've indicated previously and we'll talk more about it at the investor meeting, but our free cash flow will continue to grow very nicely, probably close to the double-digit range, similar to the earnings for the -- as we go forward. So we're feeling confident about that. We're not getting specific, obviously, about what we're doing with the share buyback. But as we indicated previously when we announced the incremental buyback and if you watched historically, we tend to do that. We said we're going to be more front-end loaded on that. And so I think you could assume the same thing as you go into FY '17. That it's more front-end loaded than towards the back half of the year. And so -- but we're not getting specific about how much we're going to be including in that piece of it. So -- and as far as tax rate goes, I mean, there's obviously the benefit of the R&D tax credit catch up during the current year. If you take that out of the equation going forward, we haven't provided any specific guidance on tax rate. But we're basically saying that our tax rate's going to be relatively flat with where we're currently at. So I wouldn't expect any significant uptick or reduction."

And that is something that we're feeling, as I said, better and better about. Having said that, then we need sort of operating leverage, like you said. And that, in the short term, comes from the Covidien synergies. But what the Covidien synergies do, is it places a -- builds a platform for us, from which we can continue the same work. As we keep growing, taking advantage of our scale in our functional cost, primarily, we think we've got productivity that has a long tail. A long tail that we can continue to do. And in addition to that, our product cost reduction will also -- has good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number. Because we feel that, that would take longer than an initial 3-year period in the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risks. That's why we didn't jump into that. But what it does is it gives us a continued sustainability beyond the 3-year period. Those are the 2 main things. It's an area of extreme focus for us, and we think it's very important for us to build a plan that's sustainable and that's diversified in a way that is reliable.

But the reality is, we are expecting some of the operating -- excuse me, some of our synergies to start to be coming in the manufacturing line.

And if there's not -- if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line, we would never have given such a tight range.

And with things like the Bellco acquisition and its math, we hadn't really done that accurately because we just closed the acquisition like a week before we -- the earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became obvious and there were pressures. And it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term, and it's an extremely accretive kind of positive deal for us. But on an immediate 3-month basis, you can get surprises. So really, our guidance should have been more thought through, and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company because it's a company with a lot of assets and capabilities, and we think that it can grow mid-single digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders on a consistent basis.

We should not have done that. We -- but we didn't realize the focus everyone was going to have on it. And the reason I think we were trying to address it and get it out there for the modeling was exactly that. It's not that we're not getting the synergies. In fact, if anything, the Covidien synergies and the other operating leverage we're getting across the organization, we feel very good about, and we're tracking that on a very tight basis. It's the other moving parts that you just get from a large organization like this, that gets specific on certain line items, is creating an issue.

So we feel good about the prospect overall and how it may -- it increases the bottom line growth. But you're right, in and of themselves, holds those contracts, the Services & Solutions component has a slightly, obviously, lower margin than the rest of the business."

When you layer in our surgical devices into those contracts in a consistent basis, that drives up our volume on very high margin devices, which gets coupled to this transaction and therefore, increases the overall margin rate significantly in those kinds of accounts from what NOK originally had. And so that's the kind of thing that we think we can scale around the world and get significant benefit."

A much greater growth in the MIS procedures versus open, and this is pretty consistent when I look at other players in the marketplace and I look at their revenue growth in the quarter. So I'm really happy about that. And truthfully, that's probably the bigger opportunity, a small uptick in surgical volumes in the U.S. versus a real change in mix shift to MIS, I'll go with the mix shift to MIS all day long. And that's pretty consistent again with what we've seen, what our reps are telling us and what we're seeing from other companies that are playing in the same space.

That is, I'll call it, one leg of a multipronged strategy around what we call Surgical Synergies. And we feel, as we move out into the future, these Surgical Synergies will be in Spine, our calling card. We have got very strong enabling technology platforms in navigation and imaging. We're excited about the partnership in robotics with Mazor. And then integrating these platforms as we move forward to provide a -- to differentiate spine procedures, both economically and clinically, and the surgeon experience, low radiation, just an easier surgical procedures, et cetera, we think is going to differentiate our Spine business. And so as you move forward, and this is going to -- this is not -- this isn't 5 years from now. This is going to take place quarter-over-quarter as we continue to emphasize this. So this is something we're very excited about. And as we move forward, outside of Surgical Synergies, we do have a number of products. Starting in our FY '14, FY '15, our Spine business put a lot of effort into revamping the product portfolio, and the products that are hitting the market now are Elevate Cage, for example, Voyager's another one. And this quarter, launching our new OLIF procedures. I'm calling them our second-generation OLIF procedures. We're getting a terrific uptick in these things. My only regret is that, 2 quarters ago, when we were planning, we didn't plan aggressively enough. And because I think we're hitting our maximum with sets. And if we had more sets, we'd even see more -- you could see more growth. So that's something we're factoring into our planning going forward as to be a little bit more aggressive. But both from a product standpoint and then from what we call Surgical Synergy standpoint, things are looking very good for our Spine business right now. And as you pointed out, every quarter, we've improved over the last 5 quarters. And it's a big shift, takes a little bit of time to kind of change the direction. And you should continue to see continued improvement quarter-over-quarter."

But -- so there's a couple of changes going on, and we'll get into this next week. But just a summary. One, moving into these different reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease state or condition versus technology. And the example I'll give is neuromodulation. I mean, that was a business largely held together based on technology, an implantable stimulator. And from whether it be Gastro/Uro, which we're now calling public health, or whether it be DBS or pain stim, they're all calling on different physicians, specialties, and we really felt we would get more traction if we organized by disease state versus by technology. So that's going to help us, one, focus on the physicians appropriately; and two, innovate. Because when we're innovating, we're looking across the disease state and across the care continuum, rather. So that's one change. And the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving to this general manager structure. So that gets to more execution, and this is something that the CVG has done over the last 4 years, 5 years, where you're having GMs that are 100% -- general managers are 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that they serve and those products within that therapy segment. And so making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular, so that's another component of that. And then along with this, we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG. And many of the leaders that are now running the group have -- are top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure, this disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and new players -- proven players from other areas in Medtronic, where we feel are very good as we hit FY '17."

We actually built a small Surgical Synergy team, which is a bridge between that business and our Spine business and looking at an integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out, and that also works for DBS as well. So before, we had 2 separate businesses that weren't linked quite close enough, in my humble opinion, to drive the Surgical Synergy benefit. So we put a small team that includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition. So just in Q4 alone, we had 15 new kind of combined capital equipment, spine, core metal deals, which is significantly more than we've had in the prior 3 quarters combined, and this is something that is a result of that. And as we move forward, you'll see the technology roadmap more integrated. So we've actually built a little bit of a bridge between Spine and our capital equipment business."

But suffice it to say that our focus within type 2, first, the type 2 population is 90% of all patients with Diabetes. So it's a huge market opportunity. And when you take a look at those 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the route of insulin delivery because that's also a core competency. But insulin delivery within that type 2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%. The broader opportunity is within monitoring. And what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you're seeing with iPro2 and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions to those type 2 patients. And at the end, our goal isn't just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product. It's really to deliver an integrated solution to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insights and that can give those patients actionable information so that they can better manage their disease and also to do the same thing for physicians who are managing those patients. So we're really excited about the opportunity. As you said, we're just getting started. But we think there's a tremendous amount of runway in this business."

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. 
You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. 
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and all year-over-year growth ranges are given on a constant currency and constant weeks basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in our prior year first quarter. As previously disclosed, we estimate the extra week had an approximate $450 million impact on revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 impact to earnings per share. The extra week impact rich business was estimated by adjusting Q1 FY '16 revenue by the prorated total company impact. The constant-currency adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak."

This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03, representing another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. All our business groups and regions delivered strong growth, resulting in company-wide revenue growth of over 5%. In addition, our continued focus on both operating and financial leverage drove solid double-digit EPS growth and the strong cash flow generation as we continue to strategically deploy our capital against our priorities of reinvesting with discipline in M&A and R&D, returning substantial cash to our shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. 
We feel very good about our momentum to start our fiscal year and we're confident in our ability to sustain this performance over the coming quarters. 
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. We have 3 specific growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: New therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions with quantified growth expectations for each. 
In new therapies, we delivered results at the upper end of our goal in Q1, contributing over 300 basis points to our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew in the mid-single digits, we continue to complement our steady cadence of differentiated products with market-leading breadth, scale and technology innovation. In CRHF, our AF Solutions and Diagnostics businesses again delivered impressive growth. AF Solutions grew in the mid-30s, well above-market growth on the strength of Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon and our recent FIRE AND ICE clinical data. 
In Diagnostics, which grew in the low double digits, market acceptance of our Reveal LINQ inserted balloon quarter had strong momentum resulting in increased pacemaker pullthrough. 
In our core CRHF business, revenues were flat in the global market but in our estimation was down in the low single digits. 
In the U.S., low single digit growth in initial implants as well as our share gains in High Power implants offset mid-single digit declines in device operations. 
We continue to take share in the U.S. with MRI systems and our recently launched [indiscernible] CD. 
In Q1, we started shipments of our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker at 1/10 [ph] the size of traditional device. Concurrently, we initiated physician training in the U.S. and we look forward to obtaining a national coverage decision from CMS for this transformative therapy by the end of the fiscal year. 
We also look forward to a number of new product  launch catalyst over the balance of the fiscal year, including Claria MRI CRT-D system, with effectiveness CRT pacing in the U.S. and Japan, Visia AF in Japan, Reveal LINQ in Japan and our CRT-P quadripolar pacing system in Europe. 
We closed our acquisition of HeartWare earlier this week, a leading innovator of [indiscernible] support technologies for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We are pleased to now significantly broaden our range of therapeutic options for heart failure patients with the addition of HeartWare and we expect it to add meaningful revenue growth to CVG throughout the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. 
Not only do we have complementary technologies and service capabilities, including infection control, physiological sensors and algorithms, remote patient monitoring and patient management and integrated diagnostics, but we also have experience the chargeable battery technologies and implantable controllers that can accelerate the development of reliable, full implantable systems. 
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES and Euphora balloons are driving solid mid-single digit international growth in our Coronary business. But we experienced decline in the U.S. from competitive product launches. We anticipate that the approval and market release of Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of FY '17. 
In the Structural heart, the global TAVR market is robust, growing 40%. We continue to gain share in international markets with our CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut R valves. However, the lack for large sized Evolut R is limiting our share in the U.S. market. We expect approval o four Evolut R XL valve early in the calendar year 2017. Earlier this month, Evolut R was the first system to be granted CE Mark for patients, and we are on track to submit our SURTAVI data for U.S. intermediate risk indication expansion approval in Q4 this fiscal year. 
In APV, we have strong high single digit growth in our Aortic business with Endurant aortic stent graft, Heli-FX EndoAnchor system and Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft technologies all fueling growth. 
In our Peripheral business, growth was driven by IN.PACT Admiral DCB, which continues to outpace and lead the fast drug coated balloon market on the strength of its handling characteristics and differentiated clinical data. 
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew in the mid-single digits with consistent quarterly performance stemming from 5 key growth drivers: minimal invasive surgery or MIS, gastrointestinal diseases, lung cancer and stage renal disease and respiratory compromise. 
Open to MIS grew in the high single digits in Q1 driven by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Energy portfolio, like the Valleylab FT10 energy platform as well as the continued adoption of Endo GIA reload with Tri-Staple technology portfolio, specifically the Endo GIA Reinforced Reloads. 
GI diseases and lung cancer also grew in the high single digits, with solid growth in our GI solutions business, resulting from the continued launch of the Barrx 360 express RF ablation balloon catheter. 
Our focus in end stage renal diseases benefiting from the fiscal Q4 acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions, respiratory compromise grew in the low double digits. We were pleased to return both the Puritan Bennett 918 ventilator and the [indiscernible] patient monitor  to customers and patients following ship holds that were put in place last fiscal year. 
We continue to supplement MITG with tuck-in acquisitions. Earlier this month we closed the acquisition of Smith & Nephew's fast growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We also closed on our agreement to acquire majority ownership position in The Netherlands Obesity Clinic or NOK, which I will cover in more detail later. 
Across MITG, we're developing solutions to expand the entire continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions. 
In our restorative therapies group, we reinvigorating therapy innovation across all 5 disease focused businesses, delivering a consistent cadence to solutions across the patient care continuum, resulting in mid-single digit growth this quarter. 
In Spine, we grew in line with the market with the mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. offsetting an international decline. Outside the U.S., we were mainly affected by the macroeconomic challenges in the Middle East, where we have strong market share and then on continued ship hold on BNT in Europe, which we believe should be resolve by the end of this fiscal year. In the U.S., we continue on an upward trajectory, delivering another quarter of sequential improvement in our growth rate. Our Speed to Scale strategy is producing tangible results as we launch the steady cadence procedural innovation like our procedure and new products, including the Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbodies for TLIF and MIDLF procedures. 
Last month, we obtained 2 level FDA approval for our PRESTIGE LP, which we expect will help drive adoption of cervical disc arthroplasty procedures in the U.S. 
In addition to Speed to Scale, our focus in Surgical Synergy, which combines enabling technology with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedural solutions is starting to show results. In fact, the combined growth of our Spine business and our spine imaging and navigation capital equipment in our neurosurgery business was in the high single digits in the U.S. in Q1. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and the more relevant comparison of our spine results than several of our competitors. 
We're also excited about our partnership with major Robotics, which is generating significant surgeon interest and together we're set to introduce the major acts later this year. 
All our businesses in our Brain Therapies division delivered the strong quarter. In neurovascular, our solid mechanical device is delivering strong results even after the anniversary of the new medicine article last year, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding extended stroke market. 
In Brain Modulation, our DBS products had a solid quarter and we have just received a CE Mark for SureTune2, which provides patient-specific visualization to aid in DBS programming. 
In neurosurgery, we saw robust sales of the recently launch O-arm O2's surgical imaging system as well as the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system. 
While our Pain Therapies division declined in the low single digits due to continued competitive pressure in our spinal stimulation products, our drug pumps grew in the mid-single digits. 
Our Interventional business showed continued strength, growing in the low single digits with our OsteoCool RF spinal tumor ablation system driving solid growth and generating pull through of our balloon products. 
And all of our business in our Specialty Therapies division, ENT, Pelvic Health and Advanced Energy [indiscernible] grew in the low double digits. 
Turning now to our Diabetes Group. We delivered high single digit growth in the quarter, with solid growth in our Intensive Insulin Management division driven by strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System outside the U.S. 
While the U.S. market remains competitive, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 630G earlier this month, and we expect to see strong U.S. growth of this platform, just like we've seen with the 640G outside U.S. The 630G features a new pump hardware platform, including a water case, HD full-color stream and remote boldest capability directly from the meter, along with several enhancements to our analyte sensor. The new platform also integrates continues glucose monitoring with SmartGuard technology, which is the only technology available in the U.S. that not only take specific action against lows but also reduces the frequency of night time low episodes by 1/3. 
In addition to our current offerings, we submitted the PMA for our hybrid closed loop system with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA in June of this year. 
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies division, we saw another quarter of great strong growth as we continue to promote our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians through our partnership with Henry Schein. Our pipeline is centered in the steady cadence of product applications and informatics innovation to enable primary care physicians and patients to make better, more informed choices in the management of type 2 diabetes. 
In our Diabetes Services & Solutions division, we saw solid growth from both our consumables business and from Diabeter, which I will cover in a moment. We are excited about the recent CE Mark approval for our Guardian Connect standalone CGM system with our current Enhanced Enlite sensor and expect initial product availability in fiscal Q3. 
In the U.S. we have submitted our PMA application to the FDA earlier this year and expect to launch Guardian Connect together with next-generation sensor in the second half of this fiscal year. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with multiple daily injections with a standalone realtime glucose monitoring solution. 
We also continue to make strong progress with our partnership with IBM and remain on track to launch our sugar IQ personal diabetes system followed by Watson in the next few months. When you combine our diabetes devices with our applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring to our partnership with IBM, we expect to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor, but a comprehensive diabetes management solution. 
Across all 4 of our groups, CVG, MITG, RTG and diabetes, our new product pipeline is robust. And we are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector within our 200 to 350 basis points goal. 
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which delivered double-digit growth contributing over 150 basis points to our total company growth, in line with our expectations. We continue to execute against our strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. We feel that these initiatives have ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. 
In Q1, our businesses in South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China all grew in the mid-teens or higher. In China, our latest -- our largest emerging market, we continue to outperform the overall market, with our unit growth rates from all 4 of our business groups growing in the mid teens. 
Latin America also had strong broad-based growth across our major markets, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico Chile and Argentina. Brazil was particularly strong from both recent distributor conversions and solid product growth in MITG. 
In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we achieved low-20s growth, with all 5 groups delivering double-digit growth. We won important tenders in several product categories and are engaged in multiple private public partnership opportunities across India. 
The only region with pressure in emerging markets in Q1 was the Middle East and Africa, where we have declines in Saudi Arabia as a result of the macroeconomic environment in that country that is causing government budget controls, product license delays and tender delays. Overall, however, the consistency of our emerging market performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence in any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single-largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term. 
Turning now to our services and solutions growth vector, which contributed approximately 30 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result is below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve strong revenue growth mostly from CVG-related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model is expanded across all our business groups. 
We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business to which we provide expertise and operation efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms. In Q1, our service revenue growth from Hospital Solutions was in the mid-40s. We have now completed a total of 97 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2.1 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of our activity is in Europe, we continue to expand into other regions, including Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. 
Our Care Management Services business, which is primarily focused in remote monitoring of high cost and chronic disease patients with co-morbidities grew in the high single digits in Q1 driven by strong interest and growth from payers as well as providers moving towards value based care models. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions. 
We are now also managing chronic conditions in diabetes and obesity through our acquisition of Diabeter and majority stake in NOK. Diabeter, our holistic diabetes care management organization that is currently operating 4 centers in The Netherlands, delivered revenue growth over 50% in Q1, and we are now treating over 1,700 patients. We are currently developing plans to expand the Diabeter model into other countries. 
NOK, the chain of clinics in The Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, offering an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. We plan to gain critical insights from NOK's methodology and expand into more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists, thereby improving patient outcomes. 
We expect all these new businesses will start to contribute significantly to the services and solutions growth vector, moving it to our expected range over the next few quarters. 
Turning now to our Q1 P&L. We grew revenue more than 5% and non-GAAP diluted EPS approximately 14% to 16%, which resulted in EPS leverage of approximately 1,000 basis points. Our strong revenue growth and high profitability is generating significant accessible free cash flow and we remain committed to returning a minimum 50% of our existing free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. 
Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to note that we continue to refine our thinking on value based health care solutions. As you know, CMS in the U.S. is shifting payments for certain episodes of care for fee-for-service to bundled payments over longer time horizon. Our recently formed orthopedic solutions business continues to refine, together with our surgeon partners, our compelling comprehensive solution for CMS's first episodic bundle in joint replacement. 
Last month, CMS announced their plans to expand bundled payments beyond hips and knees to MI and procedures, where we have significant market presence and clinical expertise. We're analyzing the details of this proposed bundles and intend to submit our comment to CMS as we move towards expected finalization of these payment model. While we're still early in the journey to value-based health care, we remain focused in fully understanding and leading the shift to health care systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. And we continue to develop partnerships and insights into how we can utilize our expertise to play a role in this evolution. We feel appropriate application of medical technology can help address the inefficiencies and improve outcomes in health care delivery, driving new forms of value creation for both our customers and our shareholders. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who I'm pleased to welcome to Medtronic, and she will take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financial results."
31348,344438943,1038863,"Medtronic plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7,166,000,000 decreased 1% as reported, or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and dive",1213,"Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7,166,000,000 decreased 1% as reported, or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately a net 70 basis points to revenue growth. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. Non-GAAP was $1.03. After adjusting for the $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and an $0.08 to $0.10 estimated impact from the extra week last fiscal year, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew approximately 14% to 16%. EPS came in slightly above our expectations due to a $0.01 to $0.02 tax benefit. 
In addition to the $376 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: A $79 million net restructuring charge; and $39 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien; a $52 million litigation charge; and a $31 million net benefit related to the resolution of several tax matters with the IRS, including a benefit from our tax issue and a charge for our proposed agreement resolving matters stemming from several acquisitions. The net tax benefit does not include any impact related to our Puerto Rico royalty rate dispute with the IRS, which has not yet been resolved. 
[indiscernible] 27.4% [ph] on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for the extra week, the operating margin showed an approximate 100 basis points improvement over the prior year. Our operating margin included a gross margin of 68.9%, SG&A of 34% and R&D of 7.8%, all on a constant-currency basis. While our gross margin was down slightly, mainly due to revenue mix, we drove improvement in SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies. We are pleased with the smooth completion of our SAP implementation in Europe in the first quarter, and we'll continue with implementations across other regions over the next several quarters. 
Separately and collectively, these conversions help drive future synergies. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also enabled serving as enablers to catalyze other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion. 
Looking ahead at our operating margin, keep in mind that the recent acquisitions, including HeartWare, while not expected to be dilutive to EPS on a net basis, could impact the operating margin percentage by an estimated 25 basis points in the second quarter and 35 basis points for the full year. However, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margin this fiscal year, as outlined at our Investor Day. 
When we take into account currency, it is also worth noting that net other expense of $39 million, which is included in the operating margin, reflects about $55 million in reduced foreign-exchange gains versus the prior year. However, the elimination of the U.S. Medical Device Tax offset that by an almost equal amount within other expense. While we had the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged especially emerging market currencies. As we have said before, that can create modest volatility in our margins. 
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $179 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had $32.1 billion in debt and $12.8 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. Our debt did increase by just under $1 billion as we issued short-term debt to manage minor timing differences between sources and uses of cash. 
Our non-GAAP nominal [ph] tax rate on a cash basis was 15.7%. This is an improvement to our forecast as it included the benefit from several operational tax adjustments for the quarter. 
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically consistently and with discipline, with a balanced focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and returns to our shareholders. We paid $599 million in dividend and repurchased a net $1.5 billion worth of ordinary shares in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 51 million shares. 
First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a dilutive basis were 1,407,000,000 shares. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. In June, our board approved another double-digit increase to our dividend, which brings our payout ratio to 40%. With regard to reinvestment, our investment, particularly M&A, must not only meet high financial return hurdles with minimal shareholder dilution, but also provide the line of sight to improving outcomes and allow for Medtronic to add value. 
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude by reiterating our outlook. Our revenue outlook and EPS guidance for fiscal year 2017 has not changed. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis, which excludes the estimated negative $450 million impact from the extra selling week we had in the first quarter of last fiscal year. While the impact in currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rate which includes $1.13 euro and JPY 100 remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, our full year revenue will be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $325 million. 
With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 16% after adjusting for the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week last fiscal year as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $0.20 to $0.25. This EPS growth implies non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70. All of this is in line with prior guidance. 
Looking at the second quarter only, we expect our revenue growth to be within our full year growth range of 5% to 6%, and our EPS growth to be in the lower half of our full year growth range of 12% to 16%, both on a constant-currency basis. Again, while currency impact is not something we predict, if exchange rates remain stable, we estimate our second quarter revenue would be positively affected by $25 million to $75 million. Other than as noted, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. 
We feel good about the performance of our operations, the overall state of our market, the diversification of our portfolio and geographies and our ability to execute, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our annual and long-term commitment. As you know, our focus is to consistently deliver revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the double digits on a constant-currency basis. Our guidance for this fiscal year remains consistent with that long-term focus.

So that was -- we felt a good timing for us. And besides, you can't plan acquisitions to the month period, it depends on a variety of circumstances and things just fell into place. We felt we have the management bandwidth to do this. The team was well prepared, had the right capabilities, and we had additional synergies that we could add in many different ways.

But we're now getting to a point where year-over-year comparison from replacements are down in sort of the low double-digit kind of range, which is obviously a function of what happened to initial implants 5 to 8 years ago depending on whether y r talking about CRT to standard ICDs. So that's obviously putting some strain on the overall market growth. We actually took share in the ICD market as we continue to get the benefit of the MRI safe technologies looking at the net just standard ICDs but also into CRT-D. And that's something that we think will continue their much on the front-end of basically mix shift toward use of MRI in standard high power and CRT-D. We also obviously have a very robust set of new products that are just hitting the market and will be added to over the course of the next several quarters, including the and single chamber segment as well as the Claria CRT-D device, which adds the EffectivCRT algorithm to our overall set of offerings. So we think, obviously, the market is going to provide a bit of a headwind because of the replacements, but we think we're in a good position to continue to take share and mitigate some of that. It was particularly encouraging to me that we could get to that mid-single-digit growth when we're seeing that kind of stress not just in the ICD market but obviously bit of an offset in our DES market as well and yet are able to still get into mid single digit growth. So we think it speaks to the importance and value of the breadth of the portfolio."

And that by definition means that there will be areas which are strong one quarter and weak in others, but overall, we're pretty confident, very confident that we can maintain even just organically the mid-single digit range, within the full range of mid single digit. We expect the acquisition to supplement that and give us more confidence in holding that range. But our new product introductions so on as well as our geographic expansion should enable us to do that. Now specifically to your question, look, we were really in a bit of a down product cycle, if you like, in the U.S. were most of our new products I do biggest impact. We think will get a bolus of new products in the coming quarter and then pick it again, but the slight drop in U.S. revenue from our typically we've been doing about 4 to about 3 this quarter is primarily that. We think in many areas, we continue to show strength, particularly in surgical procedures and within MITG portfolio and that really hasn't changed. And like Mike pointed out earlier, were in a down product cycle actually both in cardiac and in diabetes, which we think will come back in the next few quarters. So that's a dynamic in the U.S. market and therapies. And also the other thing that I'd like to point out is RTG, our restorative therapies group, led by spine, which we're watching carefully we're encouraged to see good strength there, early strength -- I mean it got demonstrate sustained capability of mid-single digit growth there, but we're pleased to see the way that RTG's moving now. And offsetting pressures even in that portfolio with strength in other areas. In emerging markets, actually of them are quite pleased. China went through all kinds of gyrations in the last 2 years, if you like, and through that, we've maintained either double-digit growth, plus or minus a little bit, in that geography. And then the other geographies have balanced each other out. I mean, Middle East and Africa has been a very strong contributor of emerging market growth over the last several quarters. This quarter, there were conditions there, but then other geographies, which is Latin America, showed considerable strength and China for that matter to offset that. So we're very confident that the projection that we made of sort of low to mid-teens double-digit growth in the emerging markets is something that is quite sustainable despite macroeconomic challenges that about. I think I cover your points, David."

Right now if you just look at the most mature products we have in that segment or area and there the mix is still in the U.S, which is the most developed market in the sense, [indiscernible] still 70% only 70% of our business is actually MRI. And recognizing that we're just moving over half the pacing business, that means that less than half of the patients we're getting pacemakers in the United States or getting MRI-safe devices. And as you go into the other product lines, ICDs, it's more like a 50% penetration rate for us, we get CRT-D, it's more like a 30% penetration for us or mix for us. The penetration rates are very well, and so we still think there's plenty of upside to go in those spaces. As competitors catch up to this, which still it's not only happening on the brady side right now and is expected to take still several quarters into next year, next calendar year, before we see ICD competition, CRT-D competition in those areas, we're continuing to advance the ball. I mean, obviously, on the pacing side, it's Micra, where we basically have an opportunity to significantly shift to a very much value-added product in the single chamber segment as we get our reimbursement in place for that, which is going to happen before the end of the year -- fiscal year. And the standard ICD segment for single chamber, the addition of is being well received in the marketplace, it's the only single chamber device that can actually do monitoring of atrial ablation without having a lead. So that gives a very significant benefit beyond simply the MRI safe characteristic of the product. And then in the CRT-D side, we're obviously adding significant therapeutic value for things like AdaptivCRT and EffectivCRT, which basically improve response rates in CRT. And because our hardware platforms, Amplia in particular, are basically positioned to be able to do multi-point pacing, we're going to add multipoint pacing capability to that Amplia  product with software downloads before the end of the fiscal year. So we continue to advance the offerings that we have beyond MRI as competitors catch up in MRI."

We launched the 630 not due to anything related to the 670, but because of 2 things. One, it gives our patients the request that they've asked for, and I touched on what some of those were from water proof to color screen. And at the same time, what it does is it refreshes our product line in the U.S. The 530G was launched in September of 2013. That's 3 years ago. And we've held our own with this product even as its long anniversary. But if you take a look at how well the 640 has done outside the United States, we thought that by bringing these patients-centric features and a new hardware platform into the U.S. now, we can could refresh our product line and really drive growth in the U.S. while we wait for the 670."

And then on top of that, where we can have meaningful payback to our shareholders through share repurchase, and that's exactly what we're doing, with our commitment to deliver a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of share repurchase.

If you look at it both from a clinical innovation perspective, the number of problems that have resolved, the patients were valued, that create a real difference in people's lives, driving equity in health care around the world, the opportunities there are again limitless. I mean we're just scratching the surface. And then on top of that, like we've talked about the challenges of addressing wastage in health care, where we're literally wasting across the world hundreds of billions of dollars in total health care spend, which -- of which there's inefficiency and primarily because of payment models and so on around the world. Should you look at all that collectively, the fact that the health care industry's growing is really not a surprise in many ways. It's an entitlement that the health care industry should have. And I think the fact that there was momentum this last quarter and last couple of quarters, I mean, that's -- it's too tough to call on something with that shorter time line. But I have every expectation that all stakeholders in health care, get their heads around these opportunities will drive a steady increase in the growth profile in health care. I think that's our entitlement. I think that's the only real comment I can make. I think all the companies that you listed are good companies with innovation, driving and creating new markets. We expect to be an equal player in many of those areas. But there are lots of people out there with great sense of purpose and inventiveness in driving the solutions.

And we feel that there's a lot of cost -- I mean the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space. And so we think we can make a conservative difference. But let's not just put that in a single bucket, because overall process includes proper risk stratification of the patient. And that risk stratification drives very specific care pathway to which adherence must be made. And then following that, a clear handoff to post-acute care in the most efficient manner possible. And finally, a clear measurement and accountability for the outcome of the patient. Those 4 things that I've just outlined are not things that today I look at holistically. And I think in each one of those areas there's conceivable inefficiency, and we believe that putting technology and using technology will not only create an inflection point in the short term but will actually create long-term sustainability of savings in that process because as you prove outcomes, you improve your cohort selection and risk stratification, your care pathways improve. And then through all of that, implants will play a role, in terms of providing the most effective implant at the appropriate cost. And when there's innovation in those areas, we'd use them to drive up outcomes. So that's the way we look at it. But you have to start with a holistic view, and implant is only a portion of that, and that's our view. Geoff, do you want to add anything on that, anything I missed?"

We look this holistic view. We look at it in several areas like the segmentation of the patients and the risk analytics, the pre-procedure patient engagement education, the inter-operative technology, not just the implants but different surgical tools that can be used that can lower the procedural cost during the hospital stay or downstream. And then the post-acute renal patient monitoring. And then finally, the patient reported outcomes, the data collection reporting on that. And look, we're seeing examples of -- for example, Advanced Energy business yesterday in Hampshire, and they have a technology that actually adds almost $500 to the cost of the procedure. 
And when they've -- over the last year, with the advent of knowing that CJR was coming, they really had to -- they revamped their go-to-market strategy, did that patient segmentation Omar was talking about, was very clear to the -- their surgeon partners and health system they're selling into what patient cohort this technology, what patient cohort did add value to that the stream and what it did not. Okay, so did that patient segmentation, they published some papers on the value of the technology downstream for those school boards patient, both clinically and economically, and they've seen a big boost in their business. So we're seeing the impact when you look at it holistically, you can document, I think it's a matter of time, you'll see certain technology separate themselves that way and both good and bad, up and down. So I think your point on the, I guess, what you call the built-in forces are keeping things stable, but I think over time, as hospitals and health systems and payers become more sophisticated looking at this holistic approach and looking at the clinical and the economic impact across the ninety-day period in this case, I think you're going to see separation.

So it was in fact only about training that this production was done, it was improve sensitivity through those particular aspects when screening patients and making sure that care is taken in terms of the delivery of the device. I would point out that our intravascular injury is actually below what is in the TDD registry. So we have a very low threshold for identifying these issues and when we think we can help improve outcomes, we obviously take action to do it. So there will be no change to the product, there were no issues with manufacturing, it basically was a training issue. On HeartWare, obviously we're very bullish on the HVAD system as is its. We think that device performed very well, we were obviously able to see details of the clinical evidence generating supporting their U.S. approval advance making the decision to acquiring the company. And I think you've seen especially in their most recent quarterly earnings results, that in Europe, they're beginning to see after the initial trial a nice bounce back in terms of overall share, which obviously is consistent with our view that this product with its smaller size, its performance characteristics, should be able to compete very effectively in that space. We continue to look at the device and decide how aggressively we want to pursue that and we're working closely with the leadership team there, very impressed with the people who are doing that work, and we look forward to being a leader in the space where -- for decades to come."

Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2017 first quarter, which ended on July 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.
You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and all year-over-year growth ranges are given on a constant currency and constant weeks basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in our prior year first quarter. As previously disclosed, we estimate the extra week had an approximate $450 million impact on revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 impact to earnings per share. The extra week impact for each business or region was estimated by adjusting Q1 FY '16 revenue by the prorated total company impact. The constant-currency adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak."

This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03, representing another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. All our business groups and regions delivered strong growth, resulting in company-wide revenue growth over 5%. In addition, our continued focus on both operating and financial leverage drove solid double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow generation as we continue to strategically deploy our capital against our priorities of reinvesting with discipline in M&A and R&D, returning substantial cash to our shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet.
We feel very good about our momentum to start our fiscal year, and we are confident in our ability to sustain this performance over the coming quarters.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. We have 3 specific growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions, with quantified growth expectations for each.
In new therapies, we delivered results at the upper end of our goal in Q1, contributing over 300 basis points to our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew in the mid-single digits, we continue to complement our steady cadence of differentiated products with market-leading breadth, scale and technology innovation.
In CRHF, our AF Solutions and Diagnostics businesses again delivered impressive growth. AF Solutions grew in the mid-30s, well above market growth, on the strength of Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon and our recent FIRE AND ICE clinical data. In Diagnostics, which grew in the low double digits, market acceptance of our Reveal LINQ insertable  loop recorder had strong momentum, resulting in increased pacemaker pull-through. 
In our core CRHF and implantables business, revenues were flat in the global market that in our estimation, was down in the low single digits.
In the U.S., low single-digit growth in initial implants as well as our share gains in High Power implants offset mid-single-digit declines in device operations.
We continue to take share in the U.S. with MRI safe systems and our recently launched Visia AF ICD. In Q1, we started shipments for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker at 1/10 the size of traditional device. Concurrently, we initiated physician training in the U.S., and we look forward to obtaining a national coverage decision from CMS for this transformative therapy by the end of the fiscal year.
We also look forward to a number of new product  launch catalysts over the balance of the fiscal year, including Claria MRI CRT-D system, with effective CRT pacing in the U.S. and Japan; Visia AF in Japan; Reveal LINQ in Japan; and our CRT-P quadripolar pacing system in Europe.
We closed our acquisition of HeartWare earlier this week, a leading innovator of miniaturized circulatory support technologies for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We are pleased to now significantly broaden our range of therapeutic options for heart failure patients with the addition of HeartWare, and we expect it to add meaningful revenue growth to CVG throughout the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.
Not only do we have complementary technologies and service capabilities, including infection control, physiological sensors and algorithms, remote patient monitoring and patient management and integrated diagnostics, but we also have experience with rechargeable battery technology and implantable controllers that can accelerate the development of reliable, fully implantable LVAD systems.
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES and Euphora balloons are driving solid mid-single-digit international growth in our Coronary business. But we experienced declines in the U.S. from competitive product launches. We anticipate FDA approval and market release of Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of FY '17.
In Structural Heart, the global TAVR market is robust, growing 40%. We continue to gain share in international markets with our CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut R valves. However, the lack for large -- a large-sized Evolut R is limiting our share in the U.S. market. We expect approval of our Evolut R XL valve early in the calendar year 2017. Earlier this month, Evolut R was the first system to be granted CE Mark for intermediate risk patients, and we are on track to submit our SURTAVI data for U.S. intermediate risk indication expansion approval in Q4 this fiscal year.
In APV, we have strong high single-digit growth in our Aortic business, with Endurant IIs aortic stent graft, Heli-FX EndoAnchor System and Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft technologies all fueling growth.
In our Peripheral business, growth was driven by IN.PACT Admiral DCB, which continues to outpace and lead the fast-growing drug-coated balloon market on the strength of its handling characteristics and differentiated clinical data.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew in the mid-single digits, with consistent quarterly performance stemming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; end-stage renal disease; and respiratory compromise.
Open to MIS grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Energy portfolio like the Valleylab FT10 energy platform as well as the continued adoption of Endo GIA reloads with Tri-Staple technology portfolio, specifically the Endo GIA reinforced reloads.
GI diseases and lung cancer also grew in the high single digits, with solid growth in our GI solutions business, resulting from the continued launch of the Barrx 360 Express RF ablation balloon catheter.
Our focus on end-stage renal disease is benefiting from the fiscal Q4 acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the low double digits. We were pleased to return both the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20-patient monitor to customers and patients following ship holds that were put in place last fiscal year.
We continue to supplement MITG with tuck-in acquisitions. Earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition of Smith & Nephew's fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We also closed on our agreement to acquire majority ownership position in The Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will cover in more detail later.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions to expand the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, we are reinvigorating therapy innovation across all 5 disease-focused businesses, delivering a consistent cadence to solutions across the patient care continuum, resulting in mid-single-digit growth this quarter.
In Spine, we grew in line with the market, with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. offsetting an international decline. Outside the U.S., we were mainly affected by the macroeconomic challenges in the Middle East where we have strong market share and the continued ship hold on BNT in Europe, which we believe should be resolved by the end of this fiscal year.
In the U.S., we continue on an upward trajectory, delivering another quarter of sequential improvement in our growth rate. Our Speed to Scale strategy is producing tangible results as we launch at steady cadence procedural innovation like our OLIF procedure and new products, including the Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbodies for TLIF and MIDLF procedures.
Last month, we obtained 2-level FDA approval for our PRESTIGE LP, which we expect will help drive adoption of cervical disc arthroplasty procedures in the U.S.
In addition to Speed to Scale, our focus in Surgical Synergy, which combines enabling technology with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedural solutions, is starting to show results. In fact, the combined growth of our spine business and our spine imaging and navigation capital equipment in our neurosurgery business was in the high single digits in the U.S. in Q1. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine results against several of our competitors.
We're also excited about our partnership with Mazor Robotics, which is generating significant surgeon interest. And together, we are set to introduce the Mazor X at NASS later this year.
All our businesses in our Brain Therapies division delivered a strong quarter. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results even after the anniversary of the New  England Journal of Medicine articles last year, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market.
In Brain Modulation, our DBS products had a solid quarter. And we just received CE Mark for SureTune2, which provides patient-specific visualization to aid in DBS programming.
In Neurosurgery, we saw robust sales of the recently launched O-arm O2 surgical imaging system as well as the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system.
While our Pain Therapies division declined in the low single digits due to continued competitive pressure in our spinal cord stimulation products, our drug pumps grew in the mid-single digits.
Our Interventional business showed continued strength, growing in the low single digits, with our OsteoCool RF spinal tumor ablation system driving solid growth and generating pull-through of our balloon kyphoplasty products.
And all of our business in our Specialty Therapies division, ENT, Pelvic Health and Advanced Energy, collectively grew in the low double digits.
Turning now to our Diabetes Group. We delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter, with solid growth in our Intensive Insulin Management division, driven by strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system outside the U.S.
While the U.S. market remains competitive, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 630G earlier this month, and we expect to see strong U.S. growth of this platform, just like we've seen with the 640G outside U.S. The 630G features a new contemporary pump hardware platform, including a waterproof case, HD full-color screen and remote bolus capability directly from the meter, along with several enhancements to our Enlite sensor. The new platform also integrates continuous glucose monitoring with SmartGuard technology, which is the only technology available in the U.S. that not only takes specific action against lows but also reduces the frequency of night time low episodes by 1/3.
In addition to our current offerings, we submitted the PMA for our hybrid closed-loop system with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA in June of this year.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies division, we saw another quarter of great strong growth as we continued to promote our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians through our partnership with Henry Schein. Our NDT pipeline is centered on the steady cadence of product applications and informatics innovation to enable primary care physicians and patients to make better, more informed choices in the management of type 2 diabetes.
In our Diabetes Services & Solutions division, we saw solid growth from both our consumables business and from Diabeter, which I will cover in a moment. We are excited about the recent CE Mark approval for our Guardian Connect stand-alone CGM system with our current Enhanced Enlite sensor and expect initial product availability in fiscal Q3. In the U.S., we have submitted our PMA application to the FDA earlier this year and expect to launch Guardian Connect together with a next-generation sensor in the second half of this fiscal year. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients in multiple daily injections with a stand-alone realtime glucose monitoring solution.
We also continue to make strong progress with our partnership with IBM and remain on track to launch our sugar IQ personal diabetes system, followed by Watson in the next few months. When you combine our diabetes devices with our applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring to our partnership with IBM, we expect to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor, but a comprehensive diabetes management solution.
Across all 4 of our groups, CVG, MITG, RTG and Diabetes, our new product pipeline is robust. And we are confident we can drive sustainable growth for our new therapies growth vector within our 200 to 350 basis point goal.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which delivered double-digit growth contributing over 150 basis points to our total company growth, in line with our expectations. We continue to execute against our strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. We feel that these initiatives have ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance.
In Q1, our businesses in South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China all grew in the mid-teens or higher. In China, our latest -- our largest emerging market, we continued to outperform the overall market, with our unit growth rates from all 4 of our business groups growing in the mid-teens.
Latin America also had strong broad-based growth across our major markets: Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Brazil was particularly strong from both recent distributor conversions and solid product growth in MITG.
In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we achieved low-20s growth, with all 5 groups delivering double-digit growth. We won important tenders in several product categories and are engaged in multiple private, public partnership opportunities across India.
The only region with pressure in emerging markets in Q1 was the Middle East and Africa, where we had declines in Saudi Arabia as a result of the macroeconomic environment in that country that is causing government budget controls, product license delays and tender delays. Overall, however, the consistency of our emerging market performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single-largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our Services & Solutions growth vector, which contributed approximately 30 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result is below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve strong revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model is expanded across all our business groups.
We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business through which we provide expertise and operation efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms. In Q1, our service revenue growth from Hospital Solutions was in the mid-40s. We have now completed a total of 97 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2.1 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of our activity is in Europe, we continue to expand into other regions, including Latin America and the Middle East and Africa.
Our Care Management Services business, which is primarily focused on remote monitoring of high-cost and chronic disease patients with co-morbidities, grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven by strong interest and growth from payers as well as providers moving towards value-based care models. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions.
We are now also managing chronic conditions in diabetes and obesity through our acquisition of Diabeter and majority stake in NOK. Diabeter, our holistic diabetes care management organization that is currently operating 4 centers in The Netherlands, delivered revenue growth over 50% in Q1, and we are now treating over 1,700 patients. We are currently developing plans to expand the Diabeter model into other countries.
NOK, the chain of clinics in The Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, offering an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. We plan to gain critical insights from NOK's methodology and expand into more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists, thereby improving patient outcomes.
We expect all these new businesses will start to contribute significantly to the Services & Solutions growth vector, moving it to our expected range over the next few quarters.
Turning now to our Q1 P&L. We grew revenue more than 5% and non-GAAP diluted EPS approximately 14% to 16%, which resulted in EPS leverage of approximately 1,000 basis points. Our strong revenue growth and high profitability is generating significant accessible free cash flow, and we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our existing free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.
Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to note that we continue to refine our thinking on value-based health care solutions. As you know, CMS in the U.S. is shifting payments for certain episodes of care from fee-for-service to bundled payments over longer time horizon. Our recently formed orthopedic solutions business continues to refine, together with our surgeon partners, our compelling comprehensive solution for CMS's first episodic bundle in joint replacement.
Last month, CMS announced their plans to expand bundled payments beyond hips and knees to MI and CABG procedures, where we have significant market presence and clinical expertise. We are analyzing the details of this proposed bundles and intend to submit our comments to CMS as they move toward the expected finalization of these payment models.
While we are still early in the journey to value-based health care, we remain focused in fully understanding and leading the shift to health care systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. And we continue to develop partnerships and insights into how we can utilize our expertise to play a role in this evolution. We feel appropriate application of medical technology can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in health care delivery, driving new forms of value creation for both our customers and our shareholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who I'm pleased to welcome to Medtronic, and she will take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financial results."
31348,344438943,1038994,"Medtronic plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7,166,000,000 decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and dives",1218,"Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7,166,000,000 decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately a net 70 basis points to revenue growth.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. Non-GAAP was $1.03. After adjusting for the $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and an $0.08 to $0.10 estimated impact from the extra week last fiscal year, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew approximately 14% to 16%. EPS came in slightly above our expectations due to a $0.01 to $0.02 tax benefit.
In addition to the $376 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $79 million net restructuring charge and a $39 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien; a $52 million litigation charge; and a $31 million net benefit related to the resolution of several tax matters with the IRS, including a benefit from our tax issue and a charge for our proposed agreement resolving matters stemming from several acquisitions. The net tax benefit does not include any impact related to our Puerto Rico royalty rate dispute with the IRS, which has not yet been resolved.
[Audio Gap] or at least 27.4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the extra week, the operating margin showed an approximate 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operating margin included a gross margin of 68.9%, SG&A of 34% and R&D of 7.8%, all on a constant currency basis. While our gross margin was down slightly, mainly due to revenue mix, we drove improvement in SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies. We are pleased with the smooth completion of our SAP implementation in Europe in the first quarter, and we'll continue with implementations across other regions over the next several quarters.  Separately and collectively, these conversions help drive future synergies.
We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to catalyze other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.
Looking ahead at our operating margin, keep in mind that recent acquisitions, including HeartWare, while not expected to be dilutive to EPS on a net basis, could impact the operating margin percentage by an estimated 25 basis points in the second quarter and 35 basis points for the full year. However, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margin this fiscal year, as outlined at our Investor Day.
When we take into account currency, it is also worth noting that net other expense of $39 million, which is included in the operating margin, reflects about $55 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year. However, the elimination of the U.S. medical device tax offset that by an almost equal amount within net other expense. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies. As we have said before, that can create modest volatility in our margins.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $179 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had $32.1 billion in debt and $12.8 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. Our debt did increase by just under $1 billion as we issued short-term debt to manage minor timing differences between sources and uses of cash.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 15.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast as it included the benefit from several operational tax adjustments for the quarter.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a balanced focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $599 million in dividend and repurchased a net $1.5 billion worth of ordinary shares in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 51 million shares. First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a dilutive basis were 1,407,000,000 shares.
We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth.
In June, our board approved another double-digit increase to our dividend, which brings our payout ratio to 40%. With regard to reinvestment, our investments, particularly M&A, must not only meet high financial return hurdles with minimal shareholder dilution but also provide a line of sight to improving outcomes and allow for Medtronic to add value.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude by reiterating our outlook. Our revenue outlook and EPS guidance for fiscal year 2017 has not changed. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis, which excludes the estimated negative $450 million impact from the extra selling week we had in the first quarter of last fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and, therefore, not something we predict, if current exchange rate, which includes $1.13 euro and JPY 100, remains stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $325 million.
With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 16% after adjusting for the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week last fiscal year as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $0.20 to $0.25. This EPS growth implies non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70. All of this is in line with prior guidance.
Looking at the second quarter only, we expect our revenue growth to be within our full year growth range of 5% to 6% and our EPS growth to be in the lower half of our full year growth range of 12% to 16%, both on a constant currency basis. Again, while currency impact is not something we predict, if exchange rates remain stable, we estimate our second quarter revenue would be positively affected by $25 million to $75 million. Other than as noted, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
We feel good about the performance of our operations, the overall state of our market, the diversification of our portfolio and geographies and our ability to execute, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our annual and long-term commitments. As you know, our focus is to consistently deliver revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the double digits on a constant currency basis. Our guidance for this fiscal year remains consistent with that long-term focus.

So that was we felt a good timing for us. And besides, you can't plan acquisitions to the month period, it depends on a variety of circumstances, and things just fell into place. We felt we have the management bandwidth to do this. The team was well prepared, had the right capabilities, and we had additional synergies that we could add in many different ways.

But we're now getting to a point where year-over-year comparison from replacements are down in sort of the low double-digit kind of range, which is obviously a function of what happened to initial implants 5 to 8 years ago depending on when you're talking about CRT to standard ICDs. So that's obviously putting some strain on the overall market growth. We actually took share in the ICD market as we continue to get the benefit of the MRI safe technologies, growing into not just standard ICDs but now also into CRT-D. And that's something that we think will continue. We think we're very much on the front end of, basically, mix shift toward use of MRI in standard High Power and in CRT-D. And we also obviously have a very robust set of new products that are just hitting the market and will be added too over the course of the next several quarters, including the Visia AF in the single-chamber segment as well as the Claria, the CRT-D device, which adds the EffectivCRT algorithm to our overall set of offerings. So we think, obviously, the market is going to provide a bit of a headwind because of the replacements, but we think we're in a good position to continue to take share and mitigate some of that. It was particularly encouraging to me that we could get to that mid-single-digit growth when we're seeing that kind of stress, not just in the ICD market but, obviously, a little bit of an offset in our DES market as well and yet are able to still get into mid-single-digit growth. So we think it speaks to the importance and value of the breadth of the portfolio."

And that, by definition, means that there will be areas which are strong one quarter and weak in others. But overall, we're pretty confident, very confident, that we can maintain, even just organically, the mid-single digit range, within the full range of mid-single digit. We expect acquisition to supplement that and give us more confidence in holding that range, but our new product introductions and so on as well as our geographic expansion should enable us to do that. Now specifically to your question, look, we were really in a bit of a down product cycle, if you like, in the U.S. where we -- most of our new products have the biggest impact. We think we'll get a bolus of new products in the coming quarters and that'll pick it again. But the slight drop in U.S. revenue from our -- typically, we've been doing about 4 to about 3 this quarter is primarily that. We think, in many areas, we continue to show strength particularly in surgical procedures and within the MITG portfolio, and that really hasn't changed. And like Mike pointed a little earlier, we're in a down product cycle, actually both in cardiac and in diabetes, which we think will come back in the next few quarters. So that's the dynamics in the U.S. market and new therapies. And also the other thing that I'd like to point out is RTG, our Restorative Therapies Group, led by Spine, which we're watching carefully. We're encouraged to see good strength there or early strength -- I mean, it's -- we've got to demonstrate sustained capability of mid-single digit growth there. But we're pleased to see the way that RTG is moving now and offsetting pressures even in that portfolio with strength in other areas. And in emerging markets, actually, again, we're quite pleased. China went through all kinds of gyrations in the last 2 years, if you like. And through that, we've maintained either double-digit growth, plus or minus a little bit, in that geography. And then the other geographies have balanced each other out. I mean, Middle East and Africa has been a very strong contributor of emerging market growth over the last several quarters. This quarter, there were conditions there, but then other geographies, which is Latin America, showed considerable strength and China, for that matter, to offset that. So we're very confident that the projection that we made of sort of low to mid-teens double-digit growth in the emerging markets is something that is quite sustainable despite macroeconomic challenges that may come about. I think I cover your points, David."

And right now, we would -- if you just look at the most mature products we have in that segment or in the dual-chamber pacing area, and there, the mix is still in the U.S, which is the most developed market, in this sense. There are still 70% -- only 70% of our business is actually MRI-safe. And recognizing that we're just moving over half the pacing business, that means that less than half of the patients who are getting pacemakers in the United States are getting MRI-safe devices. And as you go into the other product lines, ICDs, it's more like a 50% penetration rate for us. And when you get to CRT-D, it's more like a 30% penetration rate for us. So -- or a mix for us. So these penetration rates are very low, and so we still think there's plenty of upside to go in those spaces. But as competitors catch up to this, which, still, it's not -- it's only happening on the Brady side right now and is expected to take, still, several quarters into next year, next calendar year, before we see ICD competition, CRT-D competition in those areas. We're continuing to advance the ball. I mean, obviously, on the pacing side, it's Micra, right, where we basically have an opportunity to significantly shift to a very much value-added product in the single-chamber segment as we get our reimbursement in place for that, which is going to happen before the end of the year -- fiscal year. And the standard ICD segment for single chamber, the addition of Visia AF is being very well received in the marketplace. It is the only single-chamber device that could actually do monitoring of atrial fibrillation in the -- without having a lead. So it gives a very significant benefit beyond simply the MRI-safe characteristics of the product. And then in the CRT-D side, we're obviously adding significant therapeutic value with things like AdaptivCRT and EffectivCRT, which basically improve response rates in CRT. And because our hardware platforms, Amplia, in particular, are basically positioned to be able to do multi-point pacing, we're going to add multi-point pacing capability to that Amplia  product with software downloads before the end of the fiscal year. So we continue to advance the offerings that we have beyond MRI as competitors catch up in MRI."

Medtronic is an amazing company with a very strong mission that clearly spoke to me personally. I think we are a leader in the industry from a vision perspective, and I'm excited to be at a company that is leading not just the medical device industry, but the health care industry, in general. And I'm thrilled to be at a team where we're focused on growth and efficiency. In terms, specifically, of the operating margin, as you know, our focus is to drive a stronger growth in our bottom line than we have in our top line, and the only way you do that is through efficiency in our margins. We are very focused on that. We talked about driving the Covidien synergies through the completion and ultimately achieving the $850 million commitment that we have put out there. And then on top of that, as we said, we are focused on driving efficiencies throughout the company, looking at all of our processing, bringing in Lean Six Sigma to make us better and more efficient, centralizing resources where we can, and ultimately driving double-digit bottom line growth, which is much stronger than a very impressive mid single-digit top line growth."

I'm excited to step into the very big shoes of Gary, and I intend to steer the ship very much in the same direction that he has. I do come from a financial industry background.

Obviously, one of the key things that we had been doing in a ultra-low rate environment was focus on efficiency and driving strong bottom line, and so that's exactly what we'll be doing here. And in terms of capital deployment, I think the highest, best use of our capital is to grow the intrinsic value of the company through reinvestment, first and foremost. But beyond that, I think it's very important to have a dividend that is strong and that does steadily grow with earnings. And then on top of that, where we can, have meaningful payback to our shareholders through share repurchase, and that's exactly what we're doing with our commitment to deliver a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of share repurchase. In addition to the ability of us untrapping more cash, we have an additional $5 billion commitment over a 3-year period from fiscal '16 to '18.

If you look at it both from a clinical innovation perspective, the number of problems that have resolved that patients will value, that create a real difference in people's lives, driving equity in health care around the world, the opportunities there are, again, limitless, and we're just scratching the surface. And then on top of that, like we've talked about, the challenge of addressing wastage in health care, where we're literally wasting, across the world, hundreds of billions of dollars in total health care spend, which -- of which there's inefficiency in delivery, primarily because of payment models and so on around the world. Should we look at all that collectively, the fact that the health care industry is growing is really not a surprise in many ways. It's an entitlement that the health care industry should have. And I think the fact that there was momentum this last quarter and last couple of quarters, I mean, that's -- it's too tough to call on something with that short a time line. But I have every expectation that all stakeholders in health care, if they get their heads around these opportunities will drive a steady increase in the growth profile in health care. I think that's our entitlement. I think that's the only real comment I can make. I think all the companies that you listed are good companies with innovation, driving and creating new markets. We expect to be an equal player in many of those areas. But there are lots of people out there with great sense of purpose and inventiveness in driving the solutions.

It is the broad solution that is necessary, and we feel that there's a lot of cost. I mean, the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space, and so we think we can make a conservative difference. But let's not just put that in a single bucket, because an overall process includes proper risk stratification of the patients, and that risk stratification drives a very specific care pathway to which adherence must be made and then following that, a clear handoff to post-acute care in the most efficient manner possible and, finally, a clear measurement and accountability for the outcome of the patient. Those 4 things that I've just outlined are not things that, today, I look at holistically, and I think in each one of those areas, there's considerable inefficiency. And we believe that putting technology and using technology will not only create an inflection point in the short term but will actually create long-term sustainability of savings in that process. Because as you improve outcomes, you improve your cohort selection and risk stratification, your care pathways improve. And then through all of that, implants will play a role in terms of providing the most effective implant at the appropriate cost. And when there's innovation in those areas, we'd use them to drive up outcomes. So that's the way we look at it, but you have to start with a holistic view, and implant is only a portion of that. And that's our view. Geoff, do you want to add anything to that? Is there anything I missed?"

We look at it in several areas, like the segmentation of the patients and the risk analytics, the pre-procedure patient engagement, education, the interoperative technologies, not just the implants but different surgical tools that can be used that can lower the procedure cost during the hospital stay or downstream and then the post-acute patient monitoring and then, finally, the patient reported outcomes, the data collection reporting on that. And look, we're seeing examples of -- for example, I was just with our Advanced Energy business yesterday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and they have a technology that actually adds almost $500 to the cost of the procedure. 
And when they've -- over the last year, with the advent of -- knowing that CJR was coming, they really had to -- they revamped their go-to-market strategy, did that patient segmentation Omar is talking about. It was very clear to the -- their surgeon partners and the health systems they're selling into what patient cohorts this -- sorry, the hemostasis technology, what patient cohorts that added value to downstream and what it did not. Okay, so they did that patient segmentation. They published some papers on the value of the technology downstream for those cohorts of patients, both clinically and economically, and they've seen a big boost in their business. So we're seeing the impact. When you look at it holistically, you can document it. I think it's a matter of time. You'll see certain technology separate themselves for that way and -- both good and bad, up and down. And so I think your point on the -- I guess the, -- what you call it, the built-in forces are keeping things stable. But I think over time, as hospitals and health systems and payers become more sophisticated and looking at this holistic approach and looking at the clinical and economic impact across the 90-day period in this case, I think you're going to see separation. I just don't think people fully grasp it yet."

So on the field action we took, obviously, we monitor all the patients that are being treated with our products, and in that particular case, we saw some overlap between specific anatomic issues and an increase in vascular trauma. So it was, in fact only about training that this field action was done. It was to improve sensitivity to those particular aspects when screening patients and making sure that care is taken in terms of the delivery of the device. I would point out that our instance of vascular injury is actually below what is in the TVT Registry. So we have a very low threshold for identifying these issues. And where we think we can help improve outcomes, we obviously take action to do it. So there was no change to the product. There were no issues with manufacturing. It basically was a training issue. On HeartWare, obviously, we're very bullish on the HVAD system as it is. We think that device performed very well. We were obviously able to see details of the clinical evidence that they've generated in support of their U.S. approval in advance of making the decision to acquire the company. And I think you've seen, especially in their most recent quarterly earnings results, that in Europe, they're beginning to see, after the initial trialing, a nice bounce back in terms of overall share, which obviously is consistent with our view that this product, with its smaller size and its performance characteristics, should be able to compete very effectively in that space.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.
You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and all year-over-year growth ranges are given on a constant currency and constant weeks basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in our prior year first quarter. As previously disclosed, we estimate the extra week had an approximate $450 million impact on revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 impact to earnings per share. The extra week impact for each business or region was estimated by adjusting Q1 FY '16 revenue by the prorated total company impact.

31348,344438943,1039186,"Medtronic plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03, representing another quarter of strong top and bottom line growt",2996,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03, representing another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. All our business groups and regions delivered strong growth, resulting in company-wide revenue growth over 5%. In addition, our continued focus on both operating and financial leverage drove solid double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow generation as we continue to strategically deploy our capital against our priorities of reinvesting with discipline in M&A and R&D, returning substantial cash to our shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet.
We feel very good about our momentum to start our fiscal year, and we are confident in our ability to sustain this performance over the coming quarters.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. We have 3 specific growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions, with quantified growth expectations for each.
In new therapies, we delivered results at the upper end of our goal in Q1, contributing over 300 basis points to our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew in the mid-single digits, we continue to complement our steady cadence of differentiated products with market-leading breadth, scale and technology innovation.
In CRHF, our AF Solutions and Diagnostics businesses again delivered impressive growth. AF Solutions grew in the mid-30s, well above market growth, on the strength of Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon and our recent FIRE AND ICE clinical data. In Diagnostics, which grew in the low double digits, market acceptance of our Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder had strong momentum, resulting in increased pacemaker pull-through. 
In our core CRHF implantables business, revenues were flat in a global market that in our estimation, was down in the low single digits.
In the U.S., low single-digit growth in initial implants as well as our share gains in High Power implants offset mid-single-digit declines in device replacements.
We continue to take share in the U.S. with MRI-safe systems and our recently launched Visia AF ICD. In Q1, we started shipments for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker at 1/10 the size of a traditional device. Concurrently, we initiated physician training in the U.S., and we look forward to obtaining a national coverage decision from CMS for this transformative therapy by the end of the fiscal year.
We also look forward to a number of new product  launch catalysts over the balance of the fiscal year, including Claria MRI CRT-D system, with effective CRT pacing in the U.S. and Japan; Visia AF in Japan; Reveal LINQ in Japan; and our CRT-P quadripolar pacing system in Europe.
We closed our acquisition of HeartWare earlier this week, a leading innovator of miniaturized circulatory support technologies for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We are pleased to now significantly broaden our range of therapeutic options for heart failure patients with the addition of HeartWare, and we expect it to add meaningful revenue growth to CVG throughout the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.
Not only do we have complementary technologies and service capabilities, including infection control, physiological sensors and algorithms, remote patient monitoring and patient management and integrated diagnostics, but we also have experience with rechargeable battery technology and implantable controllers that can accelerate the development of reliable, fully implantable LVAD systems.
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES and Euphora balloons are driving solid mid-single-digit international growth in our Coronary business. But we experienced declines in the U.S. from competitive product launches. We anticipate FDA approval and market release of Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of FY '17.
In Structural Heart, the global TAVR market is robust, growing 40%. We continue to gain share in international markets with our CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut R valves. However, the lack of a large-sized Evolut R is limiting our share in the U.S. market. We expect approval of our Evolut R XL valve early in the calendar year 2017. Earlier this month, Evolut R was the first system to be granted CE Mark for intermediate risk patients, and we are on track to submit our SURTAVI data for U.S. intermediate risk indication expansion approval in Q4 this fiscal year.
In APV, we had strong high single-digit growth in our Aortic business, with Endurant IIs aortic stent graft, Heli-FX EndoAnchor System and Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft technologies all fueling growth.
In our Peripheral business, growth was driven by IN.PACT Admiral DCB, which continues to outpace and lead the fast-growing drug-coated balloon market on the strength of its handling characteristics and differentiated clinical data.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew in the mid-single digits, with consistent quarterly performance stemming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; end-stage renal disease; and respiratory compromise.
Open to MIS grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Energy portfolio like the Valleylab FT10 energy platform as well as the continued adoption of Endo GIA reloads with Tri-Staple technology portfolio, specifically the Endo GIA reinforced reloads.
GI diseases and lung cancer also grew in the high single digits, with solid growth in our GI solutions business, resulting from the continued launch of the Barrx 360 Express RF ablation balloon catheter.
Our focus on end-stage renal disease is benefiting from the fiscal Q4 acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the low double digits. We were pleased to return both the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20-patient monitor to customers and patients following ship holds that were put in place last fiscal year.
We continue to supplement MITG with tuck-in acquisitions. Earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition of Smith & Nephew's fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We also closed on our agreement to acquire a majority ownership position in The Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will cover in more detail later.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions to expand the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, we are reinvigorating therapy innovation across all 5 disease-focused businesses, delivering a consistent cadence of solutions across the patient care continuum, resulting in mid-single-digit growth this quarter.
In Spine, we grew in line with the market, with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. offsetting an international decline. Outside the U.S., we were mainly affected by the macroeconomic challenges in the Middle East where we have strong market share, and we have the continued ship hold on BMP in Europe, which we believe should be resolved by the end of the fiscal year.
In the U.S., we continue on an upward trajectory, delivering another quarter of sequential improvement in our growth rate. Our Speed to Scale strategy is producing tangible results as we launch a steady cadence of procedural innovation like our OLIF procedure and new products, including the Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbodies for TLIF and MIDLF procedures.
Last month, we obtained 2-level FDA approval for our PRESTIGE LP, which we expect will help drive adoption of cervical disc arthroplasty procedures in the U.S.
In addition to Speed to Scale, our focus in Surgical Synergy, which combines enabling technology with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedural solutions, is starting to show results. In fact, the combined growth of our spine business and our spine imaging and navigation capital equipment in our neurosurgery business was in the high single digits in the U.S. in Q1. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine results against several of our competitors.
We're also excited about our partnership with Mazor Robotics, which is generating significant surgeon interest. And together, we are set to introduce the Mazor X at NASS later this year.
All our businesses in our Brain Therapies division delivered a strong quarter. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine articles last year, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market.
In Brain Modulation, our DBS products had a solid quarter. And we just received CE Mark for SureTune2, which provides patient-specific visualization to aid in DBS programming.
In Neurosurgery, we saw robust sales of the recently launched O-arm O2 surgical imaging system as well as the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system.
While our Pain Therapies division declined in the low single digits due to continued competitive pressure in our spinal cord stimulation products, our drug pumps grew in the mid-single digits.
Our Interventional business showed continued strength, growing in the low single digits, with our OsteoCool RF spinal tumor ablation system driving solid growth and generating pull-through of our balloon kyphoplasty products.
And all of our business in our Specialty Therapies division, ENT, Pelvic Health and Advanced Energy, collectively grew in the low double digits.
Turning now to our Diabetes Group. We delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter, with solid growth in our Intensive Insulin Management division, driven by strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system outside the U.S.
While the U.S. market remains competitive, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 630G earlier this month, and we expect to see strong U.S. growth of this platform, just like we've seen with the 640G outside U.S. The 630G features a new contemporary pump hardware platform, including a waterproof case, HD full-color screen and remote bolus capability directly from the meter, along with several enhancements to our Enlite sensor. The new platform also integrates continuous glucose monitoring with SmartGuard technology, which is the only technology available in the U.S. that not only takes specific action against lows but also reduces the frequency of night time low episodes by 1/3.
In addition to our current offerings, we submitted the PMA for our hybrid closed-loop system with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA in June of this year.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies division, we saw another quarter of very strong growth as we continued to promote our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians through our partnership with Henry Schein. Our NDT pipeline is centered on a steady cadence of product applications and informatics innovation to enable primary care physicians and patients to make better, more informed choices in the management of type 2 diabetes.
In our Diabetes Services & Solutions division, we saw solid growth from both our consumables business and from Diabeter, which I will cover in a moment. We are excited about the recent CE Mark approval for our Guardian Connect stand-alone CGM system with our current Enhanced Enlite sensor and expect initial product availability in fiscal Q3. In the U.S., we have submitted our PMA application to the FDA earlier this year and expect to launch Guardian Connect together with a next-generation sensor in the second half of this fiscal year. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients in multiple daily injections with a stand-alone real-time glucose monitoring solution.
We also continue to make strong progress with our partnership with IBM and remain on track to launch our sugar IQ personal diabetes assistant powered by Watson, in the next few months. When you combine our diabetes devices with our applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we expect to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor, but a comprehensive diabetes management solution.
Across all 4 of our groups, CVG, MITG, RTG and Diabetes, our new product pipeline is robust. And we are confident we can drive sustainable growth for our new therapies growth vector within our 200 to 350 basis point goal.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which delivered double-digit growth contributing over 150 basis points to our total company growth, in line with our expectations. We continued to execute against our strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. We feel that these initiatives have ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance.
In Q1, our businesses in South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China all grew in the mid-teens or higher. In China, our latest -- our largest emerging market, we continued to outperform the overall market, with our unit growth rates from all 4 of our business groups growing in the mid-teens.
Latin America also had strong broad-based growth across our major markets: Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Brazil was particularly strong from both recent distributor conversions and solid product growth in MITG.
In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we achieved low-20s growth, with all 5 groups delivering double-digit growth. We won important tenders in several product categories and are engaged in multiple private, public partnership opportunities across India.
The only region with pressure in emerging markets in Q1 was the Middle East and Africa, where we had declines in Saudi Arabia as a result of the macroeconomic environment in that country that is causing government budget controls, product license delays and tender delays. Overall, however, the consistency of our emerging market performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represent the single-largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our Services & Solutions growth vector, which contributed approximately 30 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve strong revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model is expanded across all our business groups.
We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms. In Q1, our service revenue growth from Hospital Solutions was in the mid-40s. We have now completed a total of 97 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2.1 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of our activity is in Europe, we continue to expand into other regions, including Latin America and the Middle East and Africa.
Our Care Management Services business, which is primarily focused on remote monitoring of high-cost and chronic disease patients with co-morbidities, grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven by strong interest and growth from payers as well as providers moving towards value-based care models. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions.
We are now also managing chronic conditions in diabetes and obesity through our acquisition of Diabeter and majority stake in NOK. Diabeter, our holistic diabetes care management organization that is currently operating 4 centers in The Netherlands, delivered revenue growth over 50% in Q1, and we are now treating over 1,700 patients. We are currently developing plans to expand the Diabeter model into other countries.
NOK is a chain of clinics in The Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, offering an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. We plan to gain critical insights from NOK's methodology and expand into more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists, thereby improving patient outcomes.
We expect all these new businesses will start to contribute significantly to the Services & Solutions growth vector, moving it to our expected range over the next few quarters.
Turning now to our Q1 P&L. We grew revenue more than 5% and non-GAAP diluted EPS approximately 14% to 16%, which resulted in EPS leverage of approximately 1,000 basis points. Our strong revenue growth and high profitability is generating significant accessible free cash flow, and we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.
Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to note that we continue to refine our thinking on value-based health care solutions. As you know, CMS in the U.S. is shifting payments for certain episodes of care from fee-for-service to bundled payments over a longer time horizon. Our recently formed orthopedic solutions business continues to refine, together with our surgeon partners, our compelling comprehensive solution for CMS's first episodic bundle in joint replacement.
Last month, CMS announced their plans to expand bundled payments beyond hips and knees to AMI and CABG procedures, where we have significant market presence and clinical expertise. We are analyzing the details of these proposed bundles and intend to submit our comments to CMS as they move toward the expected finalization of these payment models.
While we are still early in the journey to value-based health care, we remain focused in fully understanding and leading the shift to health care systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. And we continue to develop partnerships and insights into how we can utilize our expertise to play a role in this evolution. We feel appropriate application of medical technology can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in health care delivery, driving new forms of value creation for both our customers and our shareholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who I'm pleased to welcome to Medtronic, and she will take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financial results. Karen?"
31348,344438943,1039186,"Medtronic plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7,166,000,000 decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and dives",1218,"Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7,166,000,000 decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately a net 70 basis points to revenue growth.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. Non-GAAP was $1.03. After adjusting for the $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and the $0.08 to $0.10 estimated impact from the extra week last fiscal year, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew approximately 14% to 16%. EPS came in slightly above our expectations due to a $0.01 to $0.02 tax benefit.
In addition to the $376 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $79 million net restructuring charge and a $39 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien; a $52 million litigation charge; and a $31 million net benefit related to the resolution of several tax matters with the IRS, including a benefit from our Tyco tax issue and a charge for our proposed agreement resolving matters stemming from several acquisitions. The net tax benefit does not include any impact related to our Puerto Rico royalty rate dispute with the IRS, which has not yet been resolved.
[Audio Gap] 
quarter was 27.4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the extra week, the operating margin showed an approximate 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operating margin included a gross margin of 68.9%, SG&A of 34% and R&D of 7.8%, all on a constant currency basis. While our gross margin was down slightly, mainly due to revenue mix, we drove improvement in SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies. We are pleased with the smooth completion of our SAP implementation in Europe in the first quarter, and we'll continue with implementations across other regions over the next several quarters. Separately and collectively, these conversions help drive future synergies.
We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to catalyze other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.
Looking ahead at our operating margin, keep in mind that recent acquisitions, including HeartWare, while not expected to be dilutive to EPS on a net basis, could impact the operating margin percentage by an estimated 25 basis points in the second quarter and 35 basis points for the full year. However, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margin this fiscal year, as outlined at our Investor Day.
When we take into account currency, it is also worth noting that net other expense of $39 million, which is included in the operating margin, reflects about $55 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year. However, the elimination of the U.S. medical device tax offset that by an almost equal amount within net other expense. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies. As we have said before, that can create modest volatility in our margins.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $179 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had $32.1 billion in debt and $12.8 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. Our debt did increase by just under $1 billion as we issued short-term debt to manage minor timing differences between sources and uses of cash.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 15.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast as it included the benefit from several operational tax adjustments for the quarter.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a balanced focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $599 million in dividends and repurchased a net $1.5 billion worth of ordinary shares in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 51 million shares. First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,407,000,000 shares.
We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth.
In June, our board approved another double-digit increase to our dividend, which brings our payout ratio to 40%. With regard to reinvestment, our investments, particularly M&A, must not only meet high financial return hurdles with minimal shareholder dilution but also provide a line of sight to improving outcomes and allow for Medtronic to add value.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude by reiterating our outlook. Our revenue outlook and EPS guidance for fiscal year 2017 has not changed. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis, which excludes the estimated negative $450 million impact from the extra selling week we had in the first quarter of last fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and, therefore, not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which includes $1.13 euro and JPY 100, remains stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $325 million.
With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 16% after adjusting for the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week last fiscal year as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $0.20 to $0.25. This EPS growth implies non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70. All of this is in line with prior guidance.
Looking at the second quarter only, we expect our revenue growth to be within our full year growth range of 5% to 6% and our EPS growth to be in the lower half of our full year growth range of 12% to 16%, both on a constant currency basis. Again, while currency impact is not something we predict, if exchange rates remain stable, we estimate our second quarter revenue would be positively affected by $25 million to $75 million. Other than as noted, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
We feel good about the performance of our operations, the overall state of our markets, the diversification of our portfolio and geographies and our ability to execute, all of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our annual and long-term commitments. As you know, our focus is to consistently deliver revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the double digits on a constant currency basis. Our guidance for this fiscal year remains consistent with that long-term focus.

So that was we felt a good timing for us. And besides, you can't plan acquisitions to the month, here. It depends on a variety of circumstances, and things just fell into place. We felt we had the management bandwidth to do this. The team was well prepared, had the right capabilities, and we had additional synergies that we could add in many different ways.

As it relates to ICDs, I think probably the thing that is impacting the overall market is U.S. replacements in that we saw a pretty stable low single-digit growth in initial implants for ICDs. But we're now getting to a point where year-over-year comparisons on replacements are down in sort of the low double-digit kind of range, which is obviously a function of what happened to initial implants 5 to 8 years ago, depending on whether you're talking about CRT to standard ICDs. So that's obviously putting some strain on the overall market growth. We actually took share in the ICD market as we continue to get the benefit of the MRI-safe technologies rolling into not just the standard ICDs but now also into CRT-D. And that's something that we think will continue. We think we're very much on the front end of, basically, the mix shift toward use of MRI in standard High Power and in CRT-D. And we also, obviously, have a very robust set of new products that are just hitting the market and will be added to over the course of the next several quarters, including the Visia AF in the single-chamber segment as well as the Claria CRT-D device, which adds the EffectivCRT algorithm to our overall set of offerings. So we think, obviously, the market is going to provide a bit of a headwind because of the replacements, but we think we're in a good position to continue to take share and mitigate some of that. And it was particularly encouraging to me that we could get to that mid-single-digit growth when we're seeing that kind of stress, not just in the ICD market but, obviously, we're in a little bit of an off segment on our DES market as well and yet are able to still get into mid-single-digit growth.

And that, by definition, means that there will be areas which are strong one quarter and weak in others. But overall, we're pretty confident, very confident, that we can maintain, even just organically, the mid-single digit range, within the full range of mid-single digit. We expect acquisitions to supplement that and give us more confidence in holding that range, but our new product introductions and so on as well as our geographic expansion should enable us to do that. Now specifically to your question, look, we were really in a bit of a down product cycle, if you like, in the U.S. where we -- most of our new products have the biggest impact. We think we'll get a bolus of new products in the coming quarters and that'll pick it up again. But the slight drop in U.S. revenue from our -- typically, we've been doing about 4 to about 3, this quarter is primarily that. We think in many areas we continue to show strength, particularly in surgical procedures and within the MITG portfolio. And that really hasn't changed. And like Mike pointed out a little earlier, we're in a down product cycle, actually both in cardiac and in diabetes, which we think will come back in the next few quarters. So that's the dynamics in the U.S. market and new therapies. And also the other thing that I'd like to point out is RTG, our Restorative Therapies Group, led by Spine, which we're watching carefully. We're encouraged to see good strength there or early strength, I mean, it's -- we've got to demonstrate sustained capability of mid-single digit growth there. But we're pleased to see the way that RTG is moving now and offsetting pressures even in that portfolio with strength in other areas. And in emerging markets, actually, again, we're quite pleased. China went through all kinds of gyrations in the last 2 years, if you like. And through that, we've maintained either double-digit growth, plus and minuses a little bit, in that geography. And then the other geographies have balanced each other out. I mean, Middle East and Africa has been a very strong contributor of emerging market growth over the last several quarters. This quarter there were conditions there, but then other geographies such as Latin America showed considerable strength, and China for that matter, to offset that. So we're very confident that the projection that we made of sort of low to mid-teens double-digit growth in the emerging markets is something that is quite sustainable despite macroeconomic challenges that may come about. I think I cover your points, David."

I mean, certainly this year, with HeartWare, we've got increased confidence for that. But that's the way in which we're looking at this. It's probably -- if you want a direct answer to your questions, it's probably slightly under a point that the acquisitions are adding. But that's -- things roll off, other things come in.

And right now, we would -- if you just look at the most mature products we have in that segment are in the dual-chamber pacing area. And there the mix is still in the U.S, which is the most developed market in this sense, there are still 70% -- only 70% of our business is actually MRI-safe. And recognizing that we're just a little bit over half the pacing business, that means that less than half of the patients who are getting pacemakers in the United States are getting MRI-safe devices. And as you go into the other product lines, in ICDs it's more like a 50% penetration rate for us. And when you get to CRT-D, it's more like a 30% penetration rate for us. So -- or a mix for us. So these penetration rates are very low, and so we still think there's plenty of upside to go in those spaces. But as competitors catch up to this, which, still, it's only happening on the Brady side right now and is expected to take, still, several quarters into next year, next calendar year, before we see ICD competition, CRT-D competition in those areas. We are continuing to advance the ball. I mean, obviously, on the pacing side, it's Micra, right, where we basically have an opportunity to significantly shift to a very much value-added product in the single-chamber segment as we get our reimbursement in place for that, which is going to happen before the end of the fiscal year. And the standard ICD segment for single chamber, the addition of Visia AF is being very well received in the marketplace. It is the only single-chamber device that could actually do monitoring of atrial fibrillation in the -- without having a lead. So it gives a very significant benefit beyond simply the MRI-safe characteristics of the products. And then in the CRT-D side, we're obviously adding significant therapeutic value with things like AdaptivCRT and EffectivCRT, which basically improve response rates in CRT. And because our hardware platforms, Amplia, in particular, are basically positioned to be able to do multi-point pacing, we're going to add multi-point pacing capability to that Amplia product with software downloads before the end of the fiscal year. So we continue to advance the offerings that we have beyond MRI as competitors catch up in MRI."

One, it gives our patients the requests that they've asked for, and I touched on what some of those were, from waterproof to color screen. And at the same time, what it does is it refreshes our product line in the U.S. The 530G was launched in September of 2013. That's 3 years ago. And we've held our own with this product even as its long anniversary-ed.

I mean, we're just scratching the surface. And then on top of that, like we've talked about, the challenge of addressing wastage in health care, where we're literally wasting, across the world, hundreds of billions of dollars in total health care spend, which -- of which there's inefficiency in delivery, primarily because of payment models and so on around the world. So if you look at all that collectively, the fact that the health care industry is growing is really not a surprise in many ways. It's an entitlement that the health care industry should have.

And so we look forward to, obviously, finishing the SURTAVI study, working with the FDA to get label indications for that in the United States. And we think the growth profile of the overall TAVI market, which was very robust in Q1, is going to continue to be a very impressive driver of growth for us and for med tech, in general."

[Audio Gap] 
for the status quo, and some of the intricacies of gain sharing, in terms of rebasing of internal savings, pose another impediment to change. Should we be thinking about Medtronic's orthopedic initiative principally on the basis of broad solutions, including management of patients in post-acute care? Or is really the implant side of the business really seminal to your thinking?"

It is a broad solution that is necessary, and we feel that there's a lot of cost. I mean, the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space, and so we think we can make a considerable difference.",270,"No. I think it's the former. It is a broad solution that is necessary, and we feel that there's a lot of cost. I mean, the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space, and so we think we can make a considerable difference. But let's not just put that in a single bucket, because an overall process includes proper risk stratification of the patients, and that risk stratification drives a very specific care pathway to which adherence must be made and then following that, a clear handoff to post-acute care in the most efficient manner possible and, finally, a clear measurement and accountability for the outcome of the patient. Those 4 things that I've just outlined are not things that, today, are looked at holistically. And I think in each one of those areas, there's considerable inefficiency. And we believe that putting technology and using technology will not only create an inflection point in the short term but will actually create long-term sustainability of savings in that process. Because as you improve outcomes, you improve your cohort selection and risk stratification. Your care pathways improve. And then through all of that, implants will play a role in terms of providing the most effective implant at the appropriate cost. And when there's innovation in those areas, we'd use them to drive up outcomes. So that's the way we look at it. But you have to start with a holistic view, and implant is only a portion of that. And that's our view. Geoff, do you want to add anything to that? Anything that I missed?"

We look at it in several areas: like the segmentation of the patients and the risk analytics; the pre-procedure patient engagement, education; the interoperative technologies, not just the implants but different surgical tools that can be used that can lower the procedure cost during the hospital stay or downstream; and then the post-acute remote patient monitoring; and then, finally, the patient reported outcomes, the data collection reporting on that. And look, we're seeing examples of -- for example, I was just with our Advanced Energy business yesterday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and they have a technology that actually adds almost $500 to the cost of the procedure. 
And when they've -- over the last year, with the advent of -- knowing that CJR was coming, they really had to -- they revamped their go-to-market strategy, did that patient segmentation Omar is talking about. It was very clear to the -- their surgeon partners and the health systems they're selling into what patient cohorts this -- sorry, this is the hemostasis technology, what patient cohorts it added value to downstream and what it did not. Okay, so they did that patient segmentation. They published some papers on the value of the technology downstream for those cohorts of patients, both clinically and economically, and they've seen a big boost in their business. So we're seeing the impact when you look at it holistically and you can document it. And I think it's a matter of time. You'll see certain technologies separate themselves that way and both good and bad, up and down. And so I take your point on the, I guess the, what would you call it, the built-in forces that are keeping things stable. But I think over time, as hospitals and health systems and payers become more sophisticated in looking at this holistic approach and looking at the clinical and economic impact across the 90-day period in this case, I think you're going to see separation. I just don't think people have fully grasped it yet."

So on the field action we took, obviously, we monitor all the patients that are being treated with our products, and in that particular case, we saw some overlap between specific anatomic issues and an increase in vascular trauma. So it was, in fact only about training that this field action was done. It was to improve sensitivity to those particular aspects when screening patients and making sure that care is taken in terms of the delivery of the device. I would point out that our incidence of vascular injury is actually below what is in the TVT Registry. So we have a very low threshold for identifying these issues. And when we think we can help improve outcomes, we obviously take action to do it. So there was no change to the product. There were no issues with manufacturing. It basically was a training issue. On HeartWare, obviously, we're very bullish on the HVAD system as it is. We think that device performed very well. We were obviously able to see details of the clinical evidence that they've generated in support of their U.S. approval in advance of making the decision to acquire the company. And I think you've seen, especially in their most recent quarterly earnings results, that in Europe they're beginning to see, after the initial trialing, a nice bounce back in terms of overall share, which obviously is consistent with our view that this product, with its smaller size and its performance characteristics, should be able to compete very effectively in that space. We continue to look at the MVAD [ph] device and decide how aggressively we want to pursue that, and we're working closely with the leadership team there, very impressed with the people who are doing that work.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.
You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com.
Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and all year-over-year growth ranges are given on a constant currency and constant weeks basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in our prior year first quarter. As previously disclosed, we estimate the extra week had an approximate $450 million impact on revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 impact to earnings per share. The extra week impact for each business or region was estimated by adjusting Q1 FY '16 revenue by the prorated total company impact. The constant-currency adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak."

This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03, representing another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. All our business groups and regions delivered strong growth, resulting in company-wide revenue growth over 5%. In addition, our continued focus on both operating and financial leverage drove solid double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow generation as we continue to strategically deploy our capital against our priorities of reinvesting with discipline in M&A and R&D, returning substantial cash to our shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet.
We feel very good about our momentum to start our fiscal year, and we are confident in our ability to sustain this performance over the coming quarters.
Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. We have 3 specific growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions, with quantified growth expectations for each.
In new therapies, we delivered results at the upper end of our goal in Q1, contributing over 300 basis points to our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew in the mid-single digits, we continue to complement our steady cadence of differentiated products with market-leading breadth, scale and technology innovation.
In CRHF, our AF Solutions and Diagnostics businesses again delivered impressive growth. AF Solutions grew in the mid-30s, well above market growth, on the strength of Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon and our recent FIRE AND ICE clinical data. In Diagnostics, which grew in the low double digits, market acceptance of our Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder had strong momentum, resulting in increased pacemaker pull-through. 
In our core CRHF implantables business, revenues were flat in a global market that in our estimation, was down in the low single digits.
In the U.S., low single-digit growth in initial implants as well as our share gains in High Power implants offset mid-single-digit declines in device replacements.
We continue to take share in the U.S. with MRI-safe systems and our recently launched Visia AF ICD. In Q1, we started shipments for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker at 1/10 the size of a traditional device. Concurrently, we initiated physician training in the U.S., and we look forward to obtaining a national coverage decision from CMS for this transformative therapy by the end of the fiscal year.
We also look forward to a number of new product  launch catalysts over the balance of the fiscal year, including Claria MRI CRT-D system, with effective CRT pacing in the U.S. and Japan; Visia AF in Japan; Reveal LINQ in Japan; and our CRT-P quadripolar pacing system in Europe.
We closed our acquisition of HeartWare earlier this week, a leading innovator of miniaturized circulatory support technologies for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We are pleased to now significantly broaden our range of therapeutic options for heart failure patients with the addition of HeartWare, and we expect it to add meaningful revenue growth to CVG throughout the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.
Not only do we have complementary technologies and service capabilities, including infection control, physiological sensors and algorithms, remote patient monitoring and patient management and integrated diagnostics, but we also have experience with rechargeable battery technology and implantable controllers that can accelerate the development of reliable, fully implantable LVAD systems.
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES and Euphora balloons are driving solid mid-single-digit international growth in our Coronary business. But we experienced declines in the U.S. from competitive product launches. We anticipate FDA approval and market release of Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of FY '17.
In Structural Heart, the global TAVR market is robust, growing 40%. We continue to gain share in international markets with our CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut R valves. However, the lack of a large-sized Evolut R is limiting our share in the U.S. market. We expect approval of our Evolut R XL valve early in the calendar year 2017. Earlier this month, Evolut R was the first system to be granted CE Mark for intermediate risk patients, and we are on track to submit our SURTAVI data for U.S. intermediate risk indication expansion approval in Q4 this fiscal year.
In APV, we had strong high single-digit growth in our Aortic business, with Endurant IIs aortic stent graft, Heli-FX EndoAnchor System and Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft technologies all fueling growth.
In our Peripheral business, growth was driven by IN.PACT Admiral DCB, which continues to outpace and lead the fast-growing drug-coated balloon market on the strength of its handling characteristics and differentiated clinical data.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew in the mid-single digits, with consistent quarterly performance stemming from 5 key growth drivers: open to minimally invasive surgery, or MIS; gastrointestinal diseases; lung cancer; end-stage renal disease; and respiratory compromise.
Open to MIS grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Energy portfolio like the Valleylab FT10 energy platform as well as the continued adoption of Endo GIA reloads with Tri-Staple technology portfolio, specifically the Endo GIA reinforced reloads.
GI diseases and lung cancer also grew in the high single digits, with solid growth in our GI solutions business, resulting from the continued launch of the Barrx 360 Express RF ablation balloon catheter.
Our focus on end-stage renal disease is benefiting from the fiscal Q4 acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the low double digits. We were pleased to return both the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20-patient monitor to customers and patients following ship holds that were put in place last fiscal year.
We continue to supplement MITG with tuck-in acquisitions. Earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition of Smith & Nephew's fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We also closed on our agreement to acquire a majority ownership position in The Netherlands Obesity Clinic, or NOK, which I will cover in more detail later.
Across MITG, we're developing solutions to expand the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less-invasive solutions.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, we are reinvigorating therapy innovation across all 5 disease-focused businesses, delivering a consistent cadence of solutions across the patient care continuum, resulting in mid-single-digit growth this quarter.
In Spine, we grew in line with the market, with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. offsetting an international decline. Outside the U.S., we were mainly affected by the macroeconomic challenges in the Middle East where we have strong market share, and we have the continued ship hold on BMP in Europe, which we believe should be resolved by the end of the fiscal year.
In the U.S., we continue on an upward trajectory, delivering another quarter of sequential improvement in our growth rate. Our Speed to Scale strategy is producing tangible results as we launch a steady cadence of procedural innovation like our OLIF procedure and new products, including the Solera Voyager, Elevate and PTC interbodies for TLIF and MIDLF procedures.
Last month, we obtained 2-level FDA approval for our PRESTIGE LP, which we expect will help drive adoption of cervical disc arthroplasty procedures in the U.S.
In addition to Speed to Scale, our focus in Surgical Synergy, which combines enabling technology with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedural solutions, is starting to show results. In fact, the combined growth of our spine business and our spine imaging and navigation capital equipment in our neurosurgery business was in the high single digits in the U.S. in Q1. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine results against several of our competitors.
We're also excited about our partnership with Mazor Robotics, which is generating significant surgeon interest. And together, we are set to introduce the Mazor X at NASS later this year.
All our businesses in our Brain Therapies division delivered a strong quarter. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine articles last year, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market.
In Brain Modulation, our DBS products had a solid quarter. And we just received CE Mark for SureTune2, which provides patient-specific visualization to aid in DBS programming.
In Neurosurgery, we saw robust sales of the recently launched O-arm O2 surgical imaging system as well as the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system.
While our Pain Therapies division declined in the low single digits due to continued competitive pressure in our spinal cord stimulation products, our drug pumps grew in the mid-single digits.
Our Interventional business showed continued strength, growing in the low single digits, with our OsteoCool RF spinal tumor ablation system driving solid growth and generating pull-through of our balloon kyphoplasty products.
And all of our business in our Specialty Therapies division, ENT, Pelvic Health and Advanced Energy, collectively grew in the low double digits.
Turning now to our Diabetes Group. We delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter, with solid growth in our Intensive Insulin Management division, driven by strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system outside the U.S.
While the U.S. market remains competitive, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 630G earlier this month, and we expect to see strong U.S. growth of this platform, just like we've seen with the 640G outside U.S. The 630G features a new contemporary pump hardware platform, including a waterproof case, HD full-color screen and remote bolus capability directly from the meter, along with several enhancements to our Enlite sensor. The new platform also integrates continuous glucose monitoring with SmartGuard technology, which is the only technology available in the U.S. that not only takes specific action against lows but also reduces the frequency of night time low episodes by 1/3.
In addition to our current offerings, we submitted the PMA for our hybrid closed-loop system with the Enlite 3 CGM Sensor to the FDA in June of this year.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies division, we saw another quarter of very strong growth as we continued to promote our iPro2 Professional CGM system to type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians through our partnership with Henry Schein. Our NDT pipeline is centered on a steady cadence of product applications and informatics innovation to enable primary care physicians and patients to make better, more informed choices in the management of type 2 diabetes.
In our Diabetes Services & Solutions division, we saw solid growth from both our consumables business and from Diabeter, which I will cover in a moment. We are excited about the recent CE Mark approval for our Guardian Connect stand-alone CGM system with our current Enhanced Enlite sensor and expect initial product availability in fiscal Q3. In the U.S., we have submitted our PMA application to the FDA earlier this year and expect to launch Guardian Connect together with a next-generation sensor in the second half of this fiscal year. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients in multiple daily injections with a stand-alone real-time glucose monitoring solution.
We also continue to make strong progress with our partnership with IBM and remain on track to launch our sugar IQ personal diabetes assistant powered by Watson, in the next few months. When you combine our diabetes devices with our applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we expect to provide both type 1 and type 2 patients with not just a sensor, but a comprehensive diabetes management solution.
Across all 4 of our groups, CVG, MITG, RTG and Diabetes, our new product pipeline is robust. And we are confident we can drive sustainable growth for our new therapies growth vector within our 200 to 350 basis point goal.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which delivered double-digit growth contributing over 150 basis points to our total company growth, in line with our expectations. We continued to execute against our strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. We feel that these initiatives have ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance.
In Q1, our businesses in South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China all grew in the mid-teens or higher. In China, our latest -- our largest emerging market, we continued to outperform the overall market, with our unit growth rates from all 4 of our business groups growing in the mid-teens.
Latin America also had strong broad-based growth across our major markets: Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Brazil was particularly strong from both recent distributor conversions and solid product growth in MITG.
In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we achieved low-20s growth, with all 5 groups delivering double-digit growth. We won important tenders in several product categories and are engaged in multiple private, public partnership opportunities across India.
The only region with pressure in emerging markets in Q1 was the Middle East and Africa, where we had declines in Saudi Arabia as a result of the macroeconomic environment in that country that is causing government budget controls, product license delays and tender delays. Overall, however, the consistency of our emerging market performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represent the single-largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our Services & Solutions growth vector, which contributed approximately 30 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve strong revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model is expanded across all our business groups.
We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms. In Q1, our service revenue growth from Hospital Solutions was in the mid-40s. We have now completed a total of 97 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2.1 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of 6 years. While the majority of our activity is in Europe, we continue to expand into other regions, including Latin America and the Middle East and Africa.
Our Care Management Services business, which is primarily focused on remote monitoring of high-cost and chronic disease patients with co-morbidities, grew in the high single digits in Q1, driven by strong interest and growth from payers as well as providers moving towards value-based care models. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions.
We are now also managing chronic conditions in diabetes and obesity through our acquisition of Diabeter and majority stake in NOK. Diabeter, our holistic diabetes care management organization that is currently operating 4 centers in The Netherlands, delivered revenue growth over 50% in Q1, and we are now treating over 1,700 patients. We are currently developing plans to expand the Diabeter model into other countries.
NOK is a chain of clinics in The Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, offering an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. We plan to gain critical insights from NOK's methodology and expand into more countries, providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists, thereby improving patient outcomes.
We expect all these new businesses will start to contribute significantly to the Services & Solutions growth vector, moving it to our expected range over the next few quarters.
Turning now to our Q1 P&L. We grew revenue more than 5% and non-GAAP diluted EPS approximately 14% to 16%, which resulted in EPS leverage of approximately 1,000 basis points. Our strong revenue growth and high profitability is generating significant accessible free cash flow, and we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.
Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to note that we continue to refine our thinking on value-based health care solutions. As you know, CMS in the U.S. is shifting payments for certain episodes of care from fee-for-service to bundled payments over a longer time horizon. Our recently formed orthopedic solutions business continues to refine, together with our surgeon partners, our compelling comprehensive solution for CMS's first episodic bundle in joint replacement.
Last month, CMS announced their plans to expand bundled payments beyond hips and knees to AMI and CABG procedures, where we have significant market presence and clinical expertise. We are analyzing the details of these proposed bundles and intend to submit our comments to CMS as they move toward the expected finalization of these payment models.
While we are still early in the journey to value-based health care, we remain focused in fully understanding and leading the shift to health care systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. And we continue to develop partnerships and insights into how we can utilize our expertise to play a role in this evolution. We feel appropriate application of medical technology can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in health care delivery, driving new forms of value creation for both our customers and our shareholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who I'm pleased to welcome to Medtronic, and she will take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financial results. Karen?"

Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and dives",1218,"Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7,166,000,000 decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately a net 70 basis points to revenue growth.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. Non-GAAP was $1.03. After adjusting for the $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and the $0.08 to $0.10 estimated impact from the extra week last fiscal year, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew approximately 14% to 16%. EPS came in slightly above our expectations due to a $0.01 to $0.02 tax benefit.
In addition to the $376 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $79 million net restructuring charge and a $39 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien; a $52 million litigation charge; and a $31 million net benefit related to the resolution of several tax matters with the IRS, including a benefit from our Tyco tax issue and a charge for our proposed agreement resolving matters stemming from several acquisitions. The net tax benefit does not include any impact related to our Puerto Rico royalty rate dispute with the IRS, which has not yet been resolved.
[Audio Gap] 
quarter was 27.4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the extra week, the operating margin showed an approximate 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operating margin included a gross margin of 68.9%, SG&A of 34% and R&D of 7.8%, all on a constant currency basis. While our gross margin was down slightly, mainly due to revenue mix, we drove improvement in SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies. We are pleased with the smooth completion of our SAP implementation in Europe in the first quarter, and we'll continue with implementations across other regions over the next several quarters. Separately and collectively, these conversions help drive future synergies.
We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to catalyze other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.
Looking ahead at our operating margin, keep in mind that recent acquisitions, including HeartWare, while not expected to be dilutive to EPS on a net basis, could impact the operating margin percentage by an estimated 25 basis points in the second quarter and 35 basis points for the full year. However, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margin this fiscal year, as outlined at our Investor Day.
When we take into account currency, it is also worth noting that net other expense of $39 million, which is included in the operating margin, reflects about $55 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year. However, the elimination of the U.S. medical device tax offset that by an almost equal amount within net other expense. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies. As we have said before, that can create modest volatility in our margins.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $179 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had $32.1 billion in debt and $12.8 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. Our debt did increase by just under $1 billion as we issued short-term debt to manage minor timing differences between sources and uses of cash.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 15.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast as it included the benefit from several operational tax adjustments for the quarter.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a balanced focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $599 million in dividends and repurchased a net $1.5 billion worth of ordinary shares in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 51 million shares. First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,407,000,000 shares.
We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth.
In June, our board approved another double-digit increase to our dividend, which brings our payout ratio to 40%. With regard to reinvestment, our investments, particularly M&A, must not only meet high financial return hurdles with minimal shareholder dilution but also provide a line of sight to improving outcomes and allow for Medtronic to add value.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude by reiterating our outlook. Our revenue outlook and EPS guidance for fiscal year 2017 has not changed. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis, which excludes the estimated negative $450 million impact from the extra selling week we had in the first quarter of last fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and, therefore, not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which includes $1.13 euro and JPY 100, remains stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $325 million.
With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 16% after adjusting for the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week last fiscal year as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $0.20 to $0.25. This EPS growth implies non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70. All of this is in line with prior guidance.
Looking at the second quarter only, we expect our revenue growth to be within our full year growth range of 5% to 6% and our EPS growth to be in the lower half of our full year growth range of 12% to 16%, both on a constant currency basis. Again, while currency impact is not something we predict, if exchange rates remain stable, we estimate our second quarter revenue would be positively affected by $25 million to $75 million. Other than as noted, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
We feel good about the performance of our operations, the overall state of our markets, the diversification of our portfolio and geographies and our ability to execute, all of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our annual and long-term commitments. As you know, our focus is to consistently deliver revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the double digits on a constant currency basis. Our guidance for this fiscal year remains consistent with that long-term focus.

And through that combination, drive up significant revenue, not only in the first year but in the next couple of years through real sort of milestones that the company can meet such as -- reaching approval for destination therapy and then other new products. So that was we felt a good timing for us. And besides, you can't plan acquisitions to the month, here. It depends on a variety of circumstances, and things just fell into place. We felt we had the management bandwidth to do this. The team was well prepared, had the right capabilities, and we had additional synergies that we could add in many different ways.

As it relates to ICDs, I think probably the thing that is impacting the overall market is U.S. replacements in that we saw a pretty stable low single-digit growth in initial implants for ICDs. But we're now getting to a point where year-over-year comparisons on replacements are down in sort of the low double-digit kind of range, which is obviously a function of what happened to initial implants 5 to 8 years ago, depending on whether you're talking about CRT to standard ICDs. So that's obviously putting some strain on the overall market growth. We actually took share in the ICD market as we continue to get the benefit of the MRI-safe technologies rolling into not just the standard ICDs but now also into CRT-D. And that's something that we think will continue. We think we're very much on the front end of, basically, the mix shift toward use of MRI in standard High Power and in CRT-D. And we also, obviously, have a very robust set of new products that are just hitting the market and will be added to over the course of the next several quarters, including the Visia AF in the single-chamber segment as well as the Claria CRT-D device, which adds the EffectivCRT algorithm to our overall set of offerings. So we think, obviously, the market is going to provide a bit of a headwind because of the replacements, but we think we're in a good position to continue to take share and mitigate some of that. And it was particularly encouraging to me that we could get to that mid-single-digit growth when we're seeing that kind of stress, not just in the ICD market but, obviously, we're in a little bit of an off segment on our DES market as well and yet are able to still get into mid-single-digit growth. So we think it speaks to the importance and value of the breadth of the portfolio."

And that, by definition, means that there will be areas which are strong one quarter and weak in others. But overall, we're pretty confident, very confident, that we can maintain, even just organically, the mid-single digit range, within the full range of mid-single digit. We expect acquisitions to supplement that and give us more confidence in holding that range, but our new product introductions and so on as well as our geographic expansion should enable us to do that. Now specifically to your question, look, we were really in a bit of a down product cycle, if you like, in the U.S. where we -- most of our new products have the biggest impact. We think we'll get a bolus of new products in the coming quarters and that'll pick it up again. But the slight drop in U.S. revenue from our -- typically, we've been doing about 4 to about 3, this quarter is primarily that. We think in many areas we continue to show strength, particularly in surgical procedures and within the MITG portfolio. And that really hasn't changed. And like Mike pointed out a little earlier, we're in a down product cycle, actually both in cardiac and in diabetes, which we think will come back in the next few quarters. So that's the dynamics in the U.S. market and new therapies. And also the other thing that I'd like to point out is RTG, our Restorative Therapies Group, led by Spine, which we're watching carefully. We're encouraged to see good strength there or early strength, I mean, it's -- we've got to demonstrate sustained capability of mid-single digit growth there. But we're pleased to see the way that RTG is moving now and offsetting pressures even in that portfolio with strength in other areas. And in emerging markets, actually, again, we're quite pleased. China went through all kinds of gyrations in the last 2 years, if you like. And through that, we've maintained either double-digit growth, plus and minuses a little bit, in that geography. And then the other geographies have balanced each other out. I mean, Middle East and Africa has been a very strong contributor of emerging market growth over the last several quarters. This quarter there were conditions there, but then other geographies such as Latin America showed considerable strength, and China for that matter, to offset that. So we're very confident that the projection that we made of sort of low to mid-teens double-digit growth in the emerging markets is something that is quite sustainable despite macroeconomic challenges that may come about. I think I cover your points, David."

I mean, if you add the deals up, it's something like that, probably a little less than that. But the main point though here is that the range that we projected really balances out issues that may arise, market issues and other issues that arise in our business. We feel confident that even organically, that we will be in the mid-single digit range and then the whole range, and we feel that acquisitions give us increased confidence that we will hit that and probably in the higher end of that range. I mean, certainly this year, with HeartWare, we've got increased confidence for that. But that's the way in which we're looking at this. It's probably -- if you want a direct answer to your questions, it's probably slightly under a point that the acquisitions are adding. But that's -- things roll off, other things come in. It's just a pretty dynamic picture. And believe it or not, there are some divestitures as well, like the drug business and other things that go on with our portfolio. So net-net, it's probably a little less than a full point."

And right now, we would -- if you just look at the most mature products we have in that segment are in the dual-chamber pacing area. And there the mix is still in the U.S, which is the most developed market in this sense, there are still 70% -- only 70% of our business is actually MRI-safe. And recognizing that we're just a little bit over half the pacing business, that means that less than half of the patients who are getting pacemakers in the United States are getting MRI-safe devices. And as you go into the other product lines, in ICDs it's more like a 50% penetration rate for us. And when you get to CRT-D, it's more like a 30% penetration rate for us. So -- or a mix for us. So these penetration rates are very low, and so we still think there's plenty of upside to go in those spaces. But as competitors catch up to this, which, still, it's only happening on the Brady side right now and is expected to take, still, several quarters into next year, next calendar year, before we see ICD competition, CRT-D competition in those areas. We are continuing to advance the ball. I mean, obviously, on the pacing side, it's Micra, right, where we basically have an opportunity to significantly shift to a very much value-added product in the single-chamber segment as we get our reimbursement in place for that, which is going to happen before the end of the fiscal year. And the standard ICD segment for single chamber, the addition of Visia AF is being very well received in the marketplace. It is the only single-chamber device that could actually do monitoring of atrial fibrillation in the -- without having a lead. So it gives a very significant benefit beyond simply the MRI-safe characteristics of the products. And then in the CRT-D side, we're obviously adding significant therapeutic value with things like AdaptivCRT and EffectivCRT, which basically improve response rates in CRT. And because our hardware platforms, Amplia, in particular, are basically positioned to be able to do multi-point pacing, we're going to add multi-point pacing capability to that Amplia product with software downloads before the end of the fiscal year. So we continue to advance the offerings that we have beyond MRI as competitors catch up in MRI."

One, it gives our patients the requests that they've asked for, and I touched on what some of those were, from waterproof to color screen. And at the same time, what it does is it refreshes our product line in the U.S. The 530G was launched in September of 2013. That's 3 years ago. And we've held our own with this product even as its long anniversary-ed. But if you take a look at how well the 640 has done outside the United States, we felt that by bringing these patient-centric features and a new hardware platform into the U.S. now, we could really refresh our product line and really drive growth in the U.S. while we wait for the 670."

I mean, we're just scratching the surface. And then on top of that, like we've talked about, the challenge of addressing wastage in health care, where we're literally wasting, across the world, hundreds of billions of dollars in total health care spend, which -- of which there's inefficiency in delivery, primarily because of payment models and so on around the world. So if you look at all that collectively, the fact that the health care industry is growing is really not a surprise in many ways. It's an entitlement that the health care industry should have. And I think the fact that there was momentum this last quarter and last couple of quarters, I mean, that's -- it's too tough to call on something with that short a time line. But I have every expectation that all stakeholders in health care, if they get their heads around these opportunities will drive a steady increase in the growth profile in health care. I think that's our entitlement. I think that's the only real comment I can make. I think all the companies that you listed are good companies with innovation, driving and creating new markets. We expect to be an equal player in many of those areas. But there are lots of people out there with great sense of purpose and inventiveness in driving the solutions.

It is a broad solution that is necessary, and we feel that there's a lot of cost. I mean, the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space, and so we think we can make a considerable difference. But let's not just put that in a single bucket, because an overall process includes proper risk stratification of the patients, and that risk stratification drives a very specific care pathway to which adherence must be made and then following that, a clear handoff to post-acute care in the most efficient manner possible and, finally, a clear measurement and accountability for the outcome of the patient. Those 4 things that I've just outlined are not things that, today, are looked at holistically. And I think in each one of those areas, there's considerable inefficiency. And we believe that putting technology and using technology will not only create an inflection point in the short term but will actually create long-term sustainability of savings in that process. Because as you improve outcomes, you improve your cohort selection and risk stratification. Your care pathways improve. And then through all of that, implants will play a role in terms of providing the most effective implant at the appropriate cost. And when there's innovation in those areas, we'd use them to drive up outcomes. So that's the way we look at it. But you have to start with a holistic view, and implant is only a portion of that. And that's our view. Geoff, do you want to add anything to that? Anything that I missed?"

We look at it in several areas: like the segmentation of the patients and the risk analytics; the pre-procedure patient engagement, education; the interoperative technologies, not just the implants but different surgical tools that can be used that can lower the procedure cost during the hospital stay or downstream; and then the post-acute remote patient monitoring; and then, finally, the patient reported outcomes, the data collection reporting on that. And look, we're seeing examples of -- for example, I was just with our Advanced Energy business yesterday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and they have a technology that actually adds almost $500 to the cost of the procedure. 
And when they've -- over the last year, with the advent of -- knowing that CJR was coming, they really had to -- they revamped their go-to-market strategy, did that patient segmentation Omar is talking about. It was very clear to the -- their surgeon partners and the health systems they're selling into what patient cohorts this -- sorry, this is the hemostasis technology, what patient cohorts it added value to downstream and what it did not. Okay, so they did that patient segmentation. They published some papers on the value of the technology downstream for those cohorts of patients, both clinically and economically, and they've seen a big boost in their business. So we're seeing the impact when you look at it holistically and you can document it. And I think it's a matter of time. You'll see certain technologies separate themselves that way and both good and bad, up and down. And so I take your point on the, I guess the, what would you call it, the built-in forces that are keeping things stable. But I think over time, as hospitals and health systems and payers become more sophisticated in looking at this holistic approach and looking at the clinical and economic impact across the 90-day period in this case, I think you're going to see separation. I just don't think people have fully grasped it yet."

Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Second Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results for our fiscal year 2017 second quarter, which ended on October 28, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause the actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a constant-currency basis, which adjusts for the effect of foreign currency. Other than is noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?"
31348,367843950,1090375,"Medtronic plc, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1",1606,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12, growing at 15% and representing EPS leverage of 1,120 basis points.
Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower-than-expected revenue as we await new product introductions. Despite this revenue shortfall, we produced strong improvement in operating margins and double-digit earnings per share growth. While some of the challenges that had an impact on revenue in Q2 could persist over the coming quarters, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth not only in our current fiscal year but on a sustained basis into the future.
Now normally, the diversity of our revenue base overcomes any quarterly challenges. However, there were enough unexpected and unrelated issues in Q2 to collectively affect our revenue and each of our growth vectors. Our new therapies growth vector, which contributed approximately 195 basis points to our total company growth, not only just fell below our goal of 200 to 350 basis points but was well below our trend and expectations, with the largest impacts from CVG and Diabetes. In CVG, revenue growth was 3%, below our targeted high end of the mid-single-digit range and meaningfully below what we believe this business should be able to sustain. 
In our CRHF division, strong growth contributions from diagnostics, atrial fibrillation and our recently acquired Heartware LVAD business were offset by weakness in our core cardiac rhythm implantables business, which declined in the low single digits. While we continued to take share in the U.S. ICD market, the market itself declined in the mid-single digits, driven by high single-digit market declines in high-power device replacements. In the U.K., our implantables revenue declined in the mid-teens as the National Health Service is changing its procurement model to limit bulk purchases, causing a temporary disruption to normal buying patterns of the local trusts. We expect these pressures in CRHF to continue through the fiscal year.
Our CSH division was affected by transient market share losses due to the timing of new product cycles. For example, in the fast-growing TAVR market, we lagged, until recently, a large-sized version of our Evolut R platform. And in drug-eluting stents, our new Resolute Onyx DES is not yet available in the U.S. and Japan, driving declines in both markets to competitive DES products. However, at the end of this quarter, we did receive FDA approval for Evolut R XL, which we expect to drive U.S. growth in the back half of our fiscal year. In addition, we expect the introduction of Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around fiscal year-end and Resolute Onyx in Japan in FY '18.
In our APV division, solid mid-single-digit growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, which continues to lead the market and drive mid-20s growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of our fiscal year.
Within our Diabetes Group, we were pleased with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of the MiniMED 670G, which not only represents revolutionary technology toward a long-awaited closed-loop insulin pump system but also has been received with strong enthusiasm amongst the diabetes community. However, the earlier-than-expected approval has created a bigger-than-expected gap between product approval and shipment. As a result, we created a priority access program for the 630G, which offers upgrade priority to the success 670G when launched. We are seeing strong demand for this program, primarily from early adopters. 
We do expect the majority of customers to wait to purchase the 670G once it launches in the spring of 2017. In addition to this dynamic, which is driving lower-than-expected pump and consumable sales, a portion of our 630G revenue is now deferred until receipt of the upgrade. Going forward, we expect some improved revenue growth for the remainder of this fiscal year, and we expect diabetes to ultimately return to double-digit growth once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 4% in Q2, consistent with our goal of mid-single-digit revenue growth, primarily driven by our Open-to-MIS growth driver, including strong product sales of our recently launched Valleylab F10 -- FT10 energy platform and continued performance of our endostapling specialty reloads. Surgical solutions came in slightly below our expectations, primarily driven by the impact of competitive reprocessing of our Advanced Energy vessels healing disposals -- disposables in the U.S. We are confident in our ongoing strategies and new product launches that are designed to address this headwind. 
Looking ahead, MITG expects to launch more than 15 new products in the second half of the fiscal year to drive growth, including a new powered stapling platform called Signia and new vessel-sealing enhancements. This pipeline gives us confidence that MITG can continue to grow in the mid-single digits in the back half of the fiscal year.
Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 3% this quarter, and our Spine division continued to show improvement. Overall, Spine growth was 1%, our strongest growth in 7 quarters as we gained global spine share. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3%, driven by continued adoption of INFUSE and strong adoption of our Speed to Scale launches and Surgical Synergy strategy, resulting in share gains, along with sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in neurosurgery. RTG did suffer from a voluntary recall of certain neurovascular products, which affected revenue. Some of these products will remain off the market in certain geographies for a period of time, but the most substantial impact of the recall is behind us as we bought back existing distributor inventory in Q2.
Across all of our groups, our product pipeline remains robust. We have important new growth catalysts that we expect to lead to improved second half growth. Some of these products have already been launched, and others are coming to the market in the coming months. We are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector and expect to be well within our 200 to 350 basis point goal in the back half of the year and over the longer term.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which grew 10% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our total company growth, slightly below our goal of 150 to 200 basis points. The primary driver was a shortfall in the Middle East, where our revenue declined in the mid-single digits as governments are dealing with an increased deficit, affected by declining oil prices. In Saudi Arabia, the largest market in the region and where we have a strong market leadership position, our overall business declined by approximately 40%, mostly impacting our CRHF, surgical solutions and Spine divisions. We expect continued pressure in the Middle East for the remainder of the year, but we also believe that the basic demand for our critical life-saving therapies will eventually rebound strongly.
On the positive side, our businesses in South Asia, ASEAN, Eastern Europe and Latin America all grew in the mid-teens or higher. China, our largest emerging market, grew 11%, with a double-digit growth in MITG and Diabetes and high single-digit growth in CVG and RTG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we grew again in the low-20s, with strong growth coming from key tender wins in MITG. In ASEAN, growth was broad-based, with double-digit growth in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Eastern Europe, we grew over 20% in Russia as a result of strong momentum in CVG and MITG. Latin America also had strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, driven in part by new tender wins and continued channel optimization efforts. We expect current emerging market performance levels to be sustained in the back half of the year and continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our third growth vector, Services & Solutions, which contributed 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve solid revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings.
We expect to further improve our growth contribution as new models are created and expanded across all our regions. We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise in creating operational efficiency in both cath labs and operating rooms. We're also continuing to grow our chronic care models, including Diabeter for type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid obesity, by pursuing global expansion opportunities. And finally, we formally launched our orthopedic solutions business earlier this month, a comprehensive program to help providers meet their CJR requirements in the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me reiterate that we are disappointed with our Q2 performance. That said, we also believe that these headwind events will largely temper in nature, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for the full year. What should not be lost in this discussion is that, despite revenue challenges this quarter, our organization delivered strong improvements in operating margins, including improvements in our gross margin and SG&A, and met our goal of delivering double-digit EPS growth. 
Karen will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results. Karen?"

Our second quarter revenue of $7,345,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant-currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately 120 basis points net to revenue growth. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.06 impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 15%. Strong operating performance helped offset the revenue shortfall in the quarter, and the majority of the tax benefit during the quarter was offset by a worse-than-expected impact of foreign exchange on earnings.
In addition to the $385 million adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $24 million charge for the Heartware acquisition fair market value inventory step-up; and a $35 million restructuring charge; and a $2 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien, along with expenses related to our acquisition of Heartware, offset by a net gain from the adjustments of our contingent consideration on prior acquisitions.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 28.9% on a constant-currency basis, representing a strong 150 basis point year-over-year improvement. Efficiencies in both the gross margin and SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies, drove the increase. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings in the fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.
Net other expense was $89 million compared to $57 million in the prior year, reflecting about $90 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year, primarily due to our hedging program, partially offset by a $48 million reduction in the U.S. medical device tax. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, FX can create modest volatility to the P&L above the operating margin line. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility throughout the P&L. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margins this fiscal year.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $173 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $32.4 billion in debt and $11.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 14.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included $42 million of operational net tax benefit, primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with the prior impairment of an investment in a foreign subsidiary. While we have had tax benefits in both Q1 and Q2, we continue to forecast a tax rate of approximately 17% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $593 million in dividends and repurchased a net $985 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. This represented a total payout ratio of 101% on non-GAAP net income and 142% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind our payout ratio is elevated as we not only returned 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute on our commitment to return $5 billion through incremental share repurchases by the end of fiscal year '18. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 39 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,393,000,000 shares.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our outlook. 
As Omar mentioned, we continue to expect to deliver mid-single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth this fiscal year, and we expect our revenue growth to improve from the disappointing growth this past quarter. However, given the issues we outlined in the second quarter, some of which could persist in the near term, we now expect our full year revenue growth to be within the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency, constant-weeks basis as opposed to the upper half of that range signaled previously.
Moving to the back half of the fiscal year. We expect revenue growth to also be in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. With regard to our business groups, we continue to expect MITG to grow in the mid-single digits, and we expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid-single-digit range, ramping in the back half of the year. While we expect improvement from the headwinds faced in CVG and Diabetes in the second quarter, we recognize that until some of our important new products officially launch, revenue growth is likely to continue to be affected. For that reason, in the back half of this fiscal year, we expect CVG to deliver mid-single digit and Diabetes to deliver mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Keep in mind that CVG had a strong finish to last fiscal year, so on an annual comparison basis, we expect slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter. And because we do not expect the 670G to be on the market until the end of this fiscal year, we expect growth in Diabetes to ramp through the back half, with stronger growth in the fourth quarter than the third. We continue to expect diabetes to ultimately reach double-digit revenue growth, as signaled in the past, once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and, therefore, not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which include $1.06 euro and JPY 110, remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our full year revenue to be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $60 million, including an approximate $10 million to $30 million negative impact in the third quarter. 
With respect to earnings, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth on a constant-currency, constant-week basis for the full fiscal year. For the back half of the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth to be in the 8% to 10% range on a constant-currency basis, given slightly less than previously expected revenue, a more normal 17% expected tax rate and the loss of the year-over-year benefit from a lower medical device tax starting in December. Taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week in the first quarter last fiscal year as well as an estimated negative foreign currency impact to our full year EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 if current exchange rates remain stable, this EPS growth implies full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.55 to $4.60.
Lastly, we are modifying our free cash flow outlook methodology. Recall that last quarter, we were focusing -- we were forecasting an adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal year '17, a range that would exclude cash payments related to non-GAAP items that might occur during the year. Going forward, we will include these items to more closely align our free cash flow projection with the results we report each quarter. However, in light of the unpredictability of the precise amount and timing of cash payments, we are expanding the range. Given this, along with the revenue and net income expectations already discussed, we expect our free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion. 
Now I will return the call back to Omar."

First, we are disappointed in our revenue performance this quarter. The issues that caused the shortfall are identifiable and, in many cases, temporary. As I mentioned, we have several new product introductions in the back half of the year that we expect to drive our revenue growth back to our normal range. 
Second, despite our revenue challenges, our organization delivered an operational discipline, including driving the expected Covidien synergies, which led to strong operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth.

Like I mentioned earlier, in CVG, we just launched the Evolut R XL, which will contribute to U.S. growth in the second half, and also, the introduction of the Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of the fiscal year. You mentioned diabetes. That's primarily a U.S. launch on the 670G, so that, we think, again, will have a big impact on the market. And the slowdown in diabetes was mostly in the U.S., again, which, again, impacted the overall market. In MITG, we're launching over 15 new products in the second half to drive growth. And in RTG, our continued drive on our Speed to Scale launches and so on, in addition to our sales of navigation and imaging, should all help the U.S. So we think this is a lot in our own control, and through successful execution of new product introductions, I think we'll make an impact."

First, from a surgical solutions perspective, while it is a barometer on the overall market, there were greater activity than we usually have on reprocessing, which -- and for which we're addressing that through some new launches in the second half. So we think that will impact the market. And again, like I said before, because we are so big in the market, it does move the overall market up and down depending on what we do. I really don't have any hard data to comment on the overall procedures that would really worry me as a big factor. I think our own performance is the bigger thing here. With respect to the other points, Mike, it's too early for me to comment on any changes and so on. I mean, in the end, we go back to our universal health care needs, improving clinical outcomes, driving value-based health care, increasing access. Irrespective of the government and irrespective of the country, for that matter, those are the priorities, and that's what we stay focused on. I think as long as any reform focuses on that, I think it will be accepted and will be successful. It's not easy, but it's one that we must collectively address. With respect to the tax situation, again, I don't want to speculate on what may or may not happen here. But I just want to reiterate that the reason we did the Covidien acquisition was operational. It was primarily driven by market synergies and broadening of our business and the way in which we can drive health care forward. At that time, that was the best structure, and we continue to believe that, that is the right way for us in getting access to our cash, which we've deployed effectively. I'm just going to leave it at that. We'll see how things roll out, and we'll kind of go from there. But like I've said many times before, we like to control the things that we can control and execute those well. The rest will happen around us, and it's just tough for me to speculate."

In fact, the pacing market was pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So the High Power side of the equation, we saw slightly lower growth in initial implants, but we're now looking at high single-digit declines in replacements for the market. And that's something different than we have seen historically. As we go forward, we think that we're in a particularly impacted area for CRT and that, that will get better going forward. But we also expect on the High Power side for standard ICDs that there will be this replacement headwind. That's principally coming from the fact that there was lower device implants 5, 7 years ago when these devices were being put in, in terms of initial trajectory. But an even more important impact is the lengthening life of these devices because of the improvements that we've made to the technology to extend their battery life, and that will be a bit of a headwind for us going forward. But what's going to work in our favor is pipeline. We -- if you remember from TCT, in the first half of the year, I think across all of our businesses within CVG, I think we probably had 4 -- 4, 5 new product introductions in major geographies. That's going to go up to about 25 in the back half, with some very important ones in the device implantables area, including extending the 3T MRI, bringing the Visia AF to Japan and a large number of other ones that I mentioned at TCT and identified as being catalyst for us going forward. So I think those are going to be things that we can count on to help our share position and, hopefully, also help with market growth."

David, with the 630G, your question specifically, look, what I would say is, once we have this product in the hands of our sales team and in front of physicians and patients, we actually saw a good momentum with the product. Maybe just to provide a reminder, this was approved in early August. And it takes few weeks to demo it, to get it in front of the sales team, to get it in front of physicians, and that makes August for us a tough comparison. Then when we get the 670 approved, which was much earlier than Covidien, we implemented the priority access program. And we saw, as the commentary suggested, some good uptick with respect to that, but primarily from early adopters. So I think if you take a look at it on balance, I think the 630, once it was in the marketplace, it performed well. I think our dynamic, which was surely U.S.--based, was the fact that in less than 2 months, we had 2 major product approvals in the same geography. And there is operational transition that comes with this and there's a degree of, I would say, perhaps confusion and disruption to demand because of that, that was really the biggest catalyst. Now going forward, we still remain very excited that the enthusiasm around the 670 is great, so we think that, as the commentary suggested, we're going to ramp, but once this thing is full scale, we'll return to double-digit growth."

And so we are completely confident in our ability to drive sustained mid-single-digit growth, and all our strategies are aimed towards that. And those strategies cover our ability to produce new products across a variety of market segments. Typically, that diversity would protect us. It just so happened this quarter that a collection of them all happened together. In addition to that, we've got geographic diversity which we're building, and that's our drive towards the emerging markets where we've actually, even with the enormous impact in Saudi, still delivered close to -- at 10% emerging market growth, short of our overall set of basis point target of 150 to 200, but one that we think will pick up over time and we want to get more to the middle of that target rather than the low end. And the services and solutions are a longer-term effort, but again, another one which will give us sustained growth in the long term. So we are deploying multiple strategies for a sustained and consistent mid-single-digit growth, which employs addressing new therapies, cadence of product innovation, different market segments within that, a geographic diversification, the real focus in emerging markets, and creating this new services and solutions growth factor, along the lines that you described earlier based on our value-based healthcare initiatives."

So we're not changing our EPS guidance. Double-digit EPS growth guidance stays the same while we do these acquisitions. So we consider them, although acquisitions, we make internal trade-offs to fund them, so that's the way think about those. Bigger strategic acquisitions, they are always possible like what we've done in the past, but they have to drive our strategies, our service strategy, strategic fit that we can satisfy and quantify for ourselves before we go into that, so that's the way we look at it."

And most importantly, we have got the 670G, which we'll launch towards the end of the fiscal year and we expect a ramp up in growth as the next 2 quarters go by. So we do think that a significant shift in our new product cadence will give us enough growth to take us well in the single-digit range in the back half. And also, we haven't talked much about it, but the improvement in spine and the RTG growth starts to move up the mid-single digit range, which it wasn't before. So all of these are the main factors. To be clear, look, we stated that the device replacement market in ICDs will continue to slow. We are not expecting that to turn around. We expect the NHS and the buying patterns in the U.K. to remain slow for the remainder of the year. We expect the Middle East to remain where it is. So we're going to say that those market trends will continue. The rest are all new product related, and our cadence will address it. I think that's the brunt of it."

In terms of the operating margin, I mean that was one of the positives of this quarter, that we did deliver a strong operating margin improvement, 150 basis points of constant currency improvement. We are on track. Our synergies are coming up. Our value capture programs are all delivering. Our gross margins actually are in line with what we expect.

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.

In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a constant-currency basis, which adjusts for the effect of foreign currency. Other than is noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.

31348,367843950,1090512,"Medtronic plc, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1",1606,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12, growing at 15% and representing EPS leverage of 1,120 basis points.
Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower-than-expected revenue as we await new product introductions. Despite this revenue shortfall, we produced strong improvement in operating margins and double-digit earnings per share growth. While some of the challenges that had an impact on revenue in Q2 could persist over the coming quarters, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth not only in our current fiscal year but on a sustained basis into the future.
Now normally, the diversity of our revenue base overcomes any quarterly challenges. However, there were enough unexpected and unrelated issues in Q2 to collectively affect our revenue and each of our growth vectors. Our new therapies growth vector, which contributed approximately 195 basis points to our total company growth, not only just fell below our goal of 200 to 350 basis points but was well below our trend and expectations, with the largest impacts from CVG and Diabetes. In CVG, revenue growth was 3%, below our targeted high end of the mid-single-digit range and meaningfully below what we believe this business should be able to sustain. 
In our CRHF division, strong growth contributions from diagnostics, atrial fibrillation and our recently acquired Heartware LVAD business were offset by weakness in our core cardiac rhythm implantables business, which declined in the low single digits. While we continued to take share in the U.S. ICD market, the market itself declined in the mid-single digits, driven by high single-digit market declines in high-power device replacements. In the U.K., our implantables revenue declined in the mid-teens as the National Health Service is changing its procurement model to limit bulk purchases, causing a temporary disruption to normal buying patterns of the local trusts. We expect these pressures in CRHF to continue through the fiscal year.
Our CSH division was affected by transient market share losses due to the timing of new product cycles. For example, in the fast-growing TAVR market, we lagged, until recently, a large-sized version of our Evolut R platform. And in drug-eluting stents, our new Resolute Onyx DES is not yet available in the U.S. and Japan, driving declines in both markets to competitive DES products. However, at the end of this quarter, we did receive FDA approval for Evolut R XL, which we expect to drive U.S. growth in the back half of our fiscal year. In addition, we expect the introduction of Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around fiscal year-end and Resolute Onyx in Japan in FY '18.
In our APV division, solid mid-single-digit growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, which continues to lead the market and drive mid-20s growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of our fiscal year.
Within our Diabetes Group, we were pleased with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of the MiniMED 670G, which not only represents revolutionary technology toward a long-awaited closed-loop insulin pump system but also has been received with strong enthusiasm amongst the diabetes community. However, the earlier-than-expected approval has created a bigger-than-expected gap between product approval and shipment. As a result, we created a priority access program for the 630G, which offers upgrade priority to the success 670G when launched. We are seeing strong demand for this program, primarily from early adopters. 
We do expect the majority of customers to wait to purchase the 670G once it launches in the spring of 2017. In addition to this dynamic, which is driving lower-than-expected pump and consumable sales, a portion of our 630G revenue is now deferred until receipt of the upgrade. Going forward, we expect some improved revenue growth for the remainder of this fiscal year, and we expect diabetes to ultimately return to double-digit growth once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 4% in Q2, consistent with our goal of mid-single-digit revenue growth, primarily driven by our Open-to-MIS growth driver, including strong product sales of our recently launched Valleylab F10 -- FT10 energy platform and continued performance of our endostapling specialty reloads. Surgical solutions came in slightly below our expectations, primarily driven by the impact of competitive reprocessing of our Advanced Energy vessels healing disposals -- disposables in the U.S. We are confident in our ongoing strategies and new product launches that are designed to address this headwind. 
Looking ahead, MITG expects to launch more than 15 new products in the second half of the fiscal year to drive growth, including a new powered stapling platform called Signia and new vessel-sealing enhancements. This pipeline gives us confidence that MITG can continue to grow in the mid-single digits in the back half of the fiscal year.
Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 3% this quarter, and our Spine division continued to show improvement. Overall, Spine growth was 1%, our strongest growth in 7 quarters as we gained global spine share. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3%, driven by continued adoption of INFUSE and strong adoption of our Speed to Scale launches and Surgical Synergy strategy, resulting in share gains, along with sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in neurosurgery. RTG did suffer from a voluntary recall of certain neurovascular products, which affected revenue. Some of these products will remain off the market in certain geographies for a period of time, but the most substantial impact of the recall is behind us as we bought back existing distributor inventory in Q2.
Across all of our groups, our product pipeline remains robust. We have important new growth catalysts that we expect to lead to improved second half growth. Some of these products have already been launched, and others are coming to the market in the coming months. We are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector and expect to be well within our 200 to 350 basis point goal in the back half of the year and over the longer term.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which grew 10% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our total company growth, slightly below our goal of 150 to 200 basis points. The primary driver was a shortfall in the Middle East, where our revenue declined in the mid-single digits as governments are dealing with an increased deficit, affected by declining oil prices. In Saudi Arabia, the largest market in the region and where we have a strong market leadership position, our overall business declined by approximately 40%, mostly impacting our CRHF, surgical solutions and Spine divisions. We expect continued pressure in the Middle East for the remainder of the year, but we also believe that the basic demand for our critical life-saving therapies will eventually rebound strongly.
On the positive side, our businesses in South Asia, ASEAN, Eastern Europe and Latin America all grew in the mid-teens or higher. China, our largest emerging market, grew 11%, with a double-digit growth in MITG and Diabetes and high single-digit growth in CVG and RTG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we grew again in the low-20s, with strong growth coming from key tender wins in MITG. In ASEAN, growth was broad-based, with double-digit growth in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Eastern Europe, we grew over 20% in Russia as a result of strong momentum in CVG and MITG. Latin America also had strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, driven in part by new tender wins and continued channel optimization efforts. We expect current emerging market performance levels to be sustained in the back half of the year and continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our third growth vector, Services & Solutions, which contributed 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve solid revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings.
We expect to further improve our growth contribution as new models are created and expanded across all our regions. We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, to which we provide expertise in creating operational efficiency in both cath labs and operating rooms. We're also continuing to grow our chronic care models, including Diabeter for type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid obesity, by pursuing global expansion opportunities. And finally, we formally launched our orthopedic solutions business earlier this month, a comprehensive program to help providers meet their CJR requirements in the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me reiterate that we are disappointed with our Q2 performance. That said, we also believe that these headwind events will largely temper in nature, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for the full year. What should not be lost in this discussion is that, despite revenue challenges this quarter, our organization delivered strong improvements in operating margins, including improvements in our gross margin and SG&A, and met our goal of delivering double-digit EPS growth. 
Karen will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results. Karen?"

Our second quarter revenue of $7,345,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant-currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately 120 basis points net to revenue growth. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.06 impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 15%. Strong operating performance helped offset the revenue shortfall in the quarter, and the majority of the tax benefit during the quarter was offset by a worse-than-expected impact of foreign exchange on earnings.
In addition to the $385 million adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $24 million charge for the Heartware acquisition fair market value inventory step-up; and a $35 million restructuring charge; and a $2 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien, along with expenses related to our acquisition of Heartware, offset by a net gain from the adjustments of our contingent consideration on prior acquisitions.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 28.9% on a constant-currency basis, representing a strong 150 basis point year-over-year improvement. Efficiencies in both the gross margin and SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies, drove the increase. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings in the fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.
Net other expense was $89 million compared to $57 million in the prior year, reflecting about $90 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year, primarily due to our hedging program, partially offset by a $48 million reduction in the U.S. medical device tax. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, FX can create modest volatility to the P&L above the operating margin line. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility throughout the P&L. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margins this fiscal year.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $173 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $32.4 billion in debt and $11.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 14.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included $42 million of operational net tax benefit, primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with the prior impairment of an investment in a foreign subsidiary. While we have had tax benefits in both Q1 and Q2, we continue to forecast a tax rate of approximately 17% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $593 million in dividends and repurchased a net $985 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. This represented a total payout ratio of 101% on non-GAAP net income and 142% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind our payout ratio is elevated as we not only returned 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute on our commitment to return $5 billion through incremental share repurchases by the end of fiscal year '18. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 39 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,393,000,000 shares.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our outlook. 
As Omar mentioned, we continue to expect to deliver mid-single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth this fiscal year, and we expect our revenue growth to improve from the disappointing growth this past quarter. However, given the issues we outlined in the second quarter, some of which could persist in the near term, we now expect our full year revenue growth to be within the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency, constant-weeks basis as opposed to the upper half of that range signaled previously.
Moving to the back half of the fiscal year. We expect revenue growth to also be in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. With regard to our business groups, we continue to expect MITG to grow in the mid-single digits, and we expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid-single-digit range, ramping in the back half of the year. While we expect improvement from the headwinds faced in CVG and Diabetes in the second quarter, we recognize that until some of our important new products officially launch, revenue growth is likely to continue to be affected. For that reason, in the back half of this fiscal year, we expect CVG to deliver mid-single digit and Diabetes to deliver mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Keep in mind that CVG had a strong finish to last fiscal year, so on an annual comparison basis, we expect slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter. And because we do not expect the 670G to be on the market until the end of this fiscal year, we expect growth in Diabetes to ramp through the back half, with stronger growth in the fourth quarter than the third. We continue to expect diabetes to ultimately reach double-digit revenue growth, as signaled in the past, once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and, therefore, not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which include $1.06 euro and JPY 110, remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our full year revenue to be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $60 million, including an approximate $10 million to $30 million negative impact in the third quarter. 
With respect to earnings, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth on a constant-currency, constant-week basis for the full fiscal year. For the back half of the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth to be in the 8% to 10% range on a constant-currency basis, given slightly less than previously expected revenue, a more normal 17% expected tax rate and the loss of the year-over-year benefit from a lower medical device tax starting in December. Taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week in the first quarter last fiscal year as well as an estimated negative foreign currency impact to our full year EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 if current exchange rates remain stable, this EPS growth implies full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.55 to $4.60.
Lastly, we are modifying our free cash flow outlook methodology. Recall that last quarter, we were focusing -- we were forecasting an adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal year '17, a range that would exclude cash payments related to non-GAAP items that might occur during the year. Going forward, we will include these items to more closely align our free cash flow projection with the results we report each quarter. However, in light of the unpredictability of the precise amount and timing of cash payments, we are expanding the range. Given this, along with the revenue and net income expectations already discussed, we expect our free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion. 
Now I will return the call back to Omar."

First, we are disappointed in our revenue performance this quarter. The issues that caused the shortfall are identifiable and, in many cases, temporary. As I mentioned, we have several new product introductions in the back half of the year that we expect to drive our revenue growth back to our normal range. 
Second, despite our revenue challenges, our organization delivered an operational discipline, including driving the expected Covidien synergies, which led to strong operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. And third, looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year but on a sustained basis in the future. And as always, we remain focused in creating long-term dependable value for our shareholders.
We will now open the phone lines for Q&A.

Like I mentioned earlier, in CVG, we just launched the Evolut R XL, which will contribute to U.S. growth in the second half, and also, the introduction of the Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of the fiscal year. You mentioned diabetes. That's primarily a U.S. launch on the 670G, so that, we think, again, will have a big impact on the market. And the slowdown in diabetes was mostly in the U.S., again, which, again, impacted the overall market. In MITG, we're launching over 15 new products in the second half to drive growth. And in RTG, our continued drive on our Speed to Scale launches and so on, in addition to our sales of navigation and imaging, should all help the U.S. So we think this is a lot in our own control, and through successful execution of new product introductions, I think we'll make an impact."

First, from a surgical solutions perspective, while it is a barometer on the overall market, there were greater activity than we usually have on reprocessing, which -- and for which we're addressing that through some new launches in the second half. So we think that will impact the market. And again, like I said before, because we are so big in the market, it does move the overall market up and down depending on what we do. I really don't have any hard data to comment on the overall procedures that would really worry me as a big factor. I think our own performance is the bigger thing here. With respect to the other points, Mike, it's too early for me to comment on any changes and so on. I mean, in the end, we go back to our universal health care needs, improving clinical outcomes, driving value-based health care, increasing access. Irrespective of the government and irrespective of the country, for that matter, those are the priorities, and that's what we stay focused on. I think as long as any reform focuses on that, I think it will be accepted and will be successful. It's not easy, but it's one that we must collectively address. With respect to the tax situation, again, I don't want to speculate on what may or may not happen here. But I just want to reiterate that the reason we did the Covidien acquisition was operational. It was primarily driven by market synergies and broadening of our business and the way in which we can drive health care forward. At that time, that was the best structure, and we continue to believe that, that is the right way for us in getting access to our cash, which we've deployed effectively. I'm just going to leave it at that. We'll see how things roll out, and we'll kind of go from there. But like I've said many times before, we like to control the things that we can control and execute those well. The rest will happen around us, and it's just tough for me to speculate."

In fact, the pacing market was pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So the High Power side of the equation, we saw slightly lower growth in initial implants, but we're now looking at high single-digit declines in replacements for the market. And that's something different than we have seen historically. As we go forward, we think that we're in a particularly impacted area for CRT and that, that will get better going forward. But we also expect on the High Power side for standard ICDs that there will be this replacement headwind. That's principally coming from the fact that there was lower device implants 5, 7 years ago when these devices were being put in, in terms of initial trajectory. But an even more important impact is the lengthening life of these devices because of the improvements that we've made to the technology to extend their battery life, and that will be a bit of a headwind for us going forward. But what's going to work in our favor is pipeline. We -- if you remember from TCT, in the first half of the year, I think across all of our businesses within CVG, I think we probably had 4 -- 4, 5 new product introductions in major geographies. That's going to go up to about 25 in the back half, with some very important ones in the device implantables area, including extending the 3T MRI, bringing the Visia AF to Japan and a large number of other ones that I mentioned at TCT and identified as being catalyst for us going forward. So I think those are going to be things that we can count on to help our share position and, hopefully, also help with market growth."

And even if I saw something in the quarter, unless I see a couple of quarters in a row, there's not really a solid data point there.

So Hooman, just I think we all understand the disruption in light of 670G, but I think earlier on, a few months ago, there was more enthusiasm around 630G and a reward program to sort of bridge that gap.

And then for Karen, can you just update us where we are on the buyback program? I think the commentary was most of that was going to get completed in the earlier part of the year.

David, with the 630G, your question specifically, look, what I would say is once we have this product in the hands of our sales team and in front of physicians and patients, we actually saw good momentum with the product. Maybe just to provide a reminder, this was approved in early August. And it takes few weeks to demo it, to get it in front of the sales team, to get it in front of physicians, and that makes August for us a tough comparison. Then when we get the 670 approved, which was much earlier than expected, we implemented the priority access program. And we saw, as the commentary suggested, some good uptick with respect to that, but primarily from early adopters. So I think if you take a look at it on balance, I think the 630, once it was in the marketplace, performed well. I think our dynamic, which was surely U.S.-based, was the fact that in less than 2 months, we had 2 major product approvals in the same geography. And there's operational transition that comes with this, and there's a degree of, I would say, perhaps confusion and disruption to demand because of that. And that was really the biggest catalyst. Now going forward, we still remain very excited that the enthusiasm around the 670 is great. So we think that, as the commentary suggested, we're going to ramp, but once this thing is full scale, we'll return to double-digit growth."

In terms of the operating margin, I mean that was one of the positives of this quarter, that we did deliver strong operating margin improvement, 150 basis points of constant-currency improvement. We're on track. Our synergies are coming up. Our value-capture programs are all delivering. Our gross margins actually are in line with what we expect. So we are -- certainly still think that what we presented at the analyst conference in terms of operating margin enhancements, and I think this quarter is a signal that we, in fact, can execute towards that. No, we're going to do that in future quarters, but that's the way we see it right now."

First of all, with respect to the health care policy, again, I don't want to speculate as to what's going to happen here. But what I do know, which I've stated consistently in the past, is that a move towards value-based health care, a move towards a regime where the entire health care market gets rewarded for producing better outcomes will not only lower cost but that's the only way forward, and it doesn't really matter which administration is in place or in which country you're in. That is a basic fact that is grounded in logic, and I think a focus around that will prevail.

Like I've said several times, we're not happy about the revenue performance this quarter, but we do think that the shortfall -- the reasons for the shortfall are identifiable and, in most cases, temporary.

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause the actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a constant-currency basis, which adjusts for the effect of foreign currency. Other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?"
31348,367843950,1090635,"Medtronic plc, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1",1605,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12, growing at 15% and representing EPS leverage of 1,120 basis points.
Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower-than-expected revenue as we await new product introductions. Despite this revenue shortfall, we produced strong improvement in operating margins and double-digit earnings per share growth. While some of the challenges that had an impact on revenue in Q2 could persist over the coming quarters, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth not only in our current fiscal year but on a sustained basis into the future.
Now normally, the diversity of our revenue base overcomes any quarterly challenges. However, there were enough unexpected and unrelated issues in Q2 to collectively affect our revenue and each of our growth vectors. Our new therapies growth vector, which contributed approximately 195 basis points to our total company growth, not only just fell below our goal of 200 to 350 basis points but was well below our trend and expectations, with the largest impacts from CVG and Diabetes. In CVG, revenue growth was 3%, below our targeted high end of the mid-single-digit range and meaningfully below what we believe this business should be able to sustain. 
In our CRHF division, strong growth contributions from diagnostics, atrial fibrillation and our recently acquired Heartware LVAD business were offset by weakness in our core cardiac rhythm implantables business, which declined in the low single digits. While we continued to take share in the U.S. ICD market, the market itself declined in the mid-single digits, driven by high single-digit market declines in high-power device replacements. In the U.K., our implantables revenue declined in the mid-teens as the National Health Service is changing its procurement model to limit bulk purchases, causing a temporary disruption to normal buying patterns of the local trusts. We expect these pressures in CRHF to continue through the fiscal year.
Our CSH division was affected by transient market share losses due to the timing of new product cycles. For example, in the fast-growing TAVR market, we lagged, until recently, a large-sized version of our Evolut R platform. And in drug-eluting stents, our new Resolute Onyx DES is not yet available in the U.S. and Japan, driving declines in both markets to competitive DES products. However, at the end of this quarter, we did receive FDA approval for Evolut R XL, which we expect to drive U.S. growth in the back half of our fiscal year. In addition, we expect the introduction of Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around fiscal year-end and Resolute Onyx in Japan in FY '18.
In our APV division, solid mid-single-digit growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, which continues to lead the market and drive mid-20s growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of our fiscal year.
Within our Diabetes Group, we were pleased with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of the MiniMED 670G, which not only represents revolutionary technology toward a long-awaited closed-loop insulin pump system but also has been received with strong enthusiasm amongst the diabetes community. However, the earlier-than-expected approval has created a bigger-than-expected gap between product approval and shipment. As a result, we created a priority access program for the 630G, which offers upgrade priority to the 670G when launched. We are seeing strong demand for this program, primarily from early adopters. 
We do expect the majority of customers to wait to purchase the 670G once it launches in the spring of 2017. In addition to this dynamic, which is driving lower-than-expected pump and consumable sales, a portion of our 630G revenue is now deferred until receipt of the upgrade. Going forward, we expect some improved revenue growth for the remainder of this fiscal year, and we expect diabetes to ultimately return to double-digit growth once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 4% in Q2, consistent with our goal of mid-single-digit revenue growth, primarily driven by our Open-to-MIS growth driver, including strong product sales of our recently launched Valleylab F10 -- FT10 energy platform and continued performance of our endostapling specialty reloads. Surgical solutions came in slightly below our expectations, primarily driven by the impact of competitive reprocessing of our Advanced Energy vessels healing disposals -- disposables in the U.S. We are confident in our ongoing strategies and new product launches that are designed to address this headwind. 
Looking ahead, MITG expects to launch more than 15 new products in the second half of the fiscal year to drive growth, including a new powered stapling platform called Signia and new vessel-sealing enhancements. This pipeline gives us confidence that MITG can continue to grow in the mid-single digits in the back half of the fiscal year.
Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 3% this quarter, and our Spine division continued to show improvement. Overall, Spine growth was 1%, our strongest growth in 7 quarters as we gained global spine share. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3%, driven by continued adoption of INFUSE and strong adoption of our Speed to Scale launches and Surgical Synergy strategy, resulting in share gains, along with sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in neurosurgery. RTG did suffer from a voluntary recall of certain neurovascular products, which affected revenue. Some of these products will remain off the market in certain geographies for a period of time, but the most substantial impact of the recall is behind us as we bought back existing distributor inventory in Q2.
Across all of our groups, our product pipeline remains robust. We have important new growth catalysts that we expect to lead to improved second half growth. Some of these products have already been launched, and others are coming to the market in the coming months. We are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector and expect to be well within our 200 to 350 basis point goal in the back half of the year and over the longer term.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which grew 10% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our total company growth, slightly below our goal of 150 to 200 basis points. The primary driver was a shortfall in the Middle East, where our revenue declined in the mid-single digits as governments are dealing with an increased deficit, affected by declining oil prices. In Saudi Arabia, the largest market in the region and where we have a strong market leadership position, our overall business declined by approximately 40%, mostly impacting our CRHF, Surgical Solutions and Spine divisions. We expect continued pressure in the Middle East for the remainder of the year, but we also believe that the basic demand for our critical life-saving therapies will eventually rebound strongly.
On the positive side, our businesses in South Asia, ASEAN, Eastern Europe and Latin America all grew in the mid-teens or higher. China, our largest emerging market, grew 11%, with a double-digit growth in MITG and Diabetes and high single-digit growth in CVG and RTG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we grew again in the low-20s, with strong growth coming from key tender wins in MITG. In ASEAN, growth was broad-based, with double-digit growth in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Eastern Europe, we grew over 20% in Russia as a result of strong momentum in CVG and MITG. Latin America also had strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, driven in part by new tender wins and continued channel optimization efforts. We expect current emerging market performance levels to be sustained in the back half of the year and continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our third growth vector, Services & Solutions, which contributed 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve solid revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings.
We expect to further improve our growth contribution as new models are created and expanded across all our regions. We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, through which we provide expertise in creating operational efficiency in both cath labs and operating rooms. We're also continuing to grow our chronic care models, including Diabeter for type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid obesity, by pursuing global expansion opportunities. And finally, we formally launched our Orthopedic Solutions business earlier this month, a comprehensive program to help providers meet their CJR requirements in the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me reiterate that we are disappointed with our Q2 performance. That said, we also believe that these headwind events were largely temporary in nature, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for the full year. What should not be lost in this discussion is that, despite revenue challenges this quarter, our organization delivered strong improvements in operating margins, including improvements in our gross margin and SG&A, and met our goal of delivering double-digit EPS growth. 
Karen will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results. Karen?"

Our second quarter revenue of $7,345,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant-currency basis.

Our second quarter revenue of $7,345,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant-currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately 120 basis points net to revenue growth. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.06 impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 15%. Strong operating performance helped offset the revenue shortfall in the quarter. And the majority of a tax benefit during the quarter was offset by a worse-than-expected impact of foreign exchange on earnings.
In addition to the $385 million adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $24 million charge for the Heartware acquisition fair market value inventory step-up; and a $35 million restructuring charge; and a $2 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien, along with expenses related to our acquisition of Heartware, offset by a net gain from the adjustments of our contingent consideration on prior acquisitions.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 28.9% on a constant-currency basis, representing a strong 150 basis point year-over-year improvement. Efficiencies in both the gross margin and SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies, drove the increase. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings in the fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.
Net other expense was $89 million compared to $57 million in the prior year, reflecting about $90 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year, primarily due to our hedging program, partially offset by a $48 million reduction in the U.S. medical device tax. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, FX can create modest volatility to the P&L above the operating margin line. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility throughout the P&L. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our plans to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margins this fiscal year.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $173 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $32.4 billion in debt and $11.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 14.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included $42 million of operational net tax benefits, primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with the prior impairment of an investment in a foreign subsidiary. While we have had tax benefits in both Q1 and Q2, we continue to forecast a tax rate of approximately 17% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $593 million in dividends and repurchased a net $985 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. This represented a total payout ratio of 101% on non-GAAP net income and 142% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind our payout ratio is elevated as we not only return 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute on our commitment to return $5 billion through incremental share repurchases by the end of fiscal year '18. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 39 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,393,000,000 shares.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our outlook. 
As Omar mentioned, we continue to expect to deliver mid-single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth this fiscal year, and we expect our revenue growth to improve from the disappointing growth this past quarter. However, given the issues we outlined in the second quarter, some of which could persist in the near term, we now expect our full year revenue growth to be within the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency, constant-weeks basis as opposed to the upper half of that range signaled previously.
Moving to the back half of the fiscal year. We expect revenue growth to also be in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. With regard to our business groups, we continue to expect MITG to grow in the mid-single digits, and we expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid-single-digit range, ramping in the back half of the year. While we expect improvement from the headwinds faced in CVG and Diabetes in the second quarter, we recognize that, until some of our important new products officially launch, revenue growth is likely to continue to be affected. For that reason, in the back half of this fiscal year, we expect CVG to deliver mid-single digit and Diabetes to deliver mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Keep in mind that CVG had a strong finish to last fiscal year, so on an annual comparison basis, we expect slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter. And because we do not expect the 670G to be on the market until the end of this fiscal year, we expect growth in Diabetes to ramp through the back half, with stronger growth in the fourth quarter than the third. We continue to expect diabetes to ultimately reach double-digit revenue growth, as signaled in the past, once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and, therefore, not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which include $1.06 euro and JPY 110, remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our full year revenue to be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $60 million, including an approximate $10 million to $30 million negative impact in the third quarter. 
With respect to earnings, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth on a constant-currency, constant-week basis for the full fiscal year. For the back half of the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth to be in the 8% to 10% range on a constant-currency basis, given slightly less than previously expected revenue, a more normal 17% expected tax rate and the loss of the year-over-year benefit from a lower medical device tax starting in December. Taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week in the first quarter last fiscal year as well as an estimated negative foreign currency impact to our full year EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 if current exchange rates remain stable, this EPS growth implies full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.55 to $4.60.
Lastly, we are modifying our free cash flow outlook methodology. Recall that last quarter, we were focusing -- we were forecasting an adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal year '17, a range that would exclude cash payments related to non-GAAP items that might occur during the year. Going forward, we will include these items to more closely align our free cash flow projection with the results we report each quarter. However, in light of the unpredictability of the precise amount and timing of cash payments, we are expanding the range. Given this, along with the revenue and net income expectations already discussed, we expect our free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion. 
Now I will return the call back to Omar."

First, we are disappointed in our revenue performance this quarter. The issues that caused the shortfall are identifiable and, in many cases, temporary. As I mentioned, we have several new product introductions in the back half of the year that we expect to drive our revenue growth back to our normal range. 
Second, despite our revenue challenges, our organization delivered an operational discipline, including driving the expected Covidien synergies, which led to strong operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. And third, looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year but on a sustained basis in the future. And as always, we remain focused on creating long-term dependable value for our shareholders.
We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us.

I think probably the best way to think about kind of the one question investors are going to have today is on the U.S. business. And so if we looked at U.S. growth corporate-wide on an organic basis, it's basically flat this quarter. So I'd love to hear just kind of the group's thoughts on the health of the U.S. device market and what appears to be some slowdown, at least reflected in your results and some other companies' results over the last quarter."

Like I mentioned earlier, in CVG, we just launched the Evolut R XL, which will contribute to U.S. growth in the second half, and also, the introduction of the Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of the fiscal year. You mentioned diabetes. That's primarily a U.S. launch on the 670G, so that, we think, again, will have a big impact on the market. And the slowdown in diabetes was mostly in the U.S., again, which, again, impacted the overall market. In MITG, we're launching over 15 new products in the second half to drive growth. And in RTG, our continued drive on our Speed to Scale launches and so on, in addition to our sales in navigation and imaging, should all help the U.S. So we think this is a lot in our own control, and through successful execution of new product introductions, I think we'll make an impact."

So maybe just -- if you just want to kind of comment on that. And then just the follow-up, unrelated to the actual quarter, is I know there are a lot of questions coming out of the outcome of the U.S. election and the potential for corporate tax reform.

First, from a Surgical Solutions perspective, while it is a barometer on the overall market, there were greater activity than we usually have on reprocessing, which -- and for which we're addressing that through some new launches in the second half. So we think that will impact the market. And again, like I said before, because we are so big in the market, it does move the overall market up and down depending on what we do. I really don't have any hard data to comment on the overall procedures that would really worry me as a big factor. I think our own performance is the bigger thing here. With respect to the other points, Mike, it's too early for me to comment on any changes and so on. I mean, in the end, we go back to our universal health care needs, improving clinical outcomes, driving value-based health care, increasing access. Irrespective of the government and irrespective of the country, for that matter, those are the priorities, and that's what we stay focused on. I think as long as any reform focuses on that, I think it will be accepted and will be successful. It's not easy, but it's one that we must collectively address. With respect to the tax situation, again, I don't want to speculate on what may or may not happen here. But I just want to reiterate that the reason we did the Covidien acquisition was operational. It was primarily driven by market synergies and broadening of our business and the way in which we can drive health care forward. At that time, that was the best structure, and we continue to believe that, that is the right way for us in getting access to our cash, which we've deployed effectively. I'm just going to leave it at that. We'll see how things roll out, and we'll kind of go from there. But like I've said many times before, we like to control the things that we can control and execute those well. The rest will happen around us, and it's tough for me to speculate."

In fact, the pacing market was pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So the High Power side of the equation, we saw slightly lower growth in initial implants, but we're now looking at high single-digit declines in replacements for the market. And that's something different than we have seen historically. As we go forward, we think that we're in a particularly impacted area for CRT and that, that will get better going forward. But we also expect on the High Power side for standard ICDs that there will be this replacement headwind. That's principally coming from the fact that there was lower device implants 5, 7 years ago when these devices were being put in, in terms of initial trajectory. But an even more important impact is the lengthening life of these devices because of improvements that we've made to the technology to extend their battery life, and that will be a bit of a headwind for us going forward. But what's going to work in our favor is pipeline. We -- if you remember from TCT, in the first half of the year, I think across all of our businesses within CVG, I think we probably had 4 -- 4 or 5 new product introductions in major geographies. That's going to go up to about 25 in the back half, with some very important ones in the device implantables area, including extending the 3T MRI, bringing the Visia AF to Japan and a large number of other ones that I mentioned at TCT and identified as being a catalyst for us going forward. So I think those are going to be things that we can count on to help our share position and, hopefully, also help with market growth."

Maybe just to provide a reminder, this was approved in early August. And it takes few weeks to demo it, to get it in front of the sales team, to get it in front of physicians, and that makes August for us a tough comparison. Then when we get the 670 approved, which was much earlier than expected, we implemented the priority access program. And we saw, as the commentary suggested, some good uptick with respect to that, but primarily from early adopters. So I think if you take a look at it on balance, I think the 630, once it was in the marketplace, performed well. I think our dynamic, which was purely U.S.-based, was the fact that in less than 2 months, we had 2 major product approvals in the same geography. And there's operational transition that comes with this, and there's a degree of, I would say, perhaps confusion and disruption to demand because of that. And that was really the biggest catalyst. Now going forward, we still remain very excited that the enthusiasm around the 670 is great.

And also, we haven't talked much about it, but the improvement in Spine and the RTG growth starts to move up to the mid-single-digit range, which it wasn't before. So all of these are the main factors. To be clear, look, we stated that the device replacement market in ICDs will continue to slow. We're not expecting that to turn around. We expect the NHS and the buying patterns in the U.K. to remain slow for the remainder of the year. We expect the Middle East to remain where it is.

First of all, with respect to the health care policy, again, I don't want to speculate as to what's going to happen here. But what I do know, which I've stated consistently in the past, is that a move towards value-based health care, a move towards a regime where the entire health care market gets rewarded for producing better outcomes will not only lower costs but that's the only way forward, and it doesn't really matter which administration is in place or in which country you're in. That is a basic fact, grounded in logic, and I think a focus around that will prevail. And I think that will be important in any future policies that are made, and there's an alignment of stakeholders pushing in that direction. With respect to the pruning, look, we look at divestitures and acquisitions with the same lens. Does it fit our strategy? Can we win in that marketplace? Can we do our financial metrics of returning 50% back to the shareholders and then growing mid-single digits and double-digit EPS growth? I mean, do those financial metrics -- are they in line with that acquisition or not or divestiture or not? And based on those factors, we make decisions. And certainly, we're looking at different areas of our business all the time, and you should expect to get periodic updates from us on that score. Did I miss any point?"

Like I've said several times, we're not happy about the revenue performance this quarter, but we do think that the shortfall -- the reasons for the shortfall are identifiable and, in most cases, temporary. And we expect our new product introductions primarily to drive a recovery in the back half of the year and in -- longer term.

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause the actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a constant-currency basis, which adjusts for the effect of foreign currency. Other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?"
31348,367843950,1090837,"Medtronic plc, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1",1605,"Good morning, and thank you, Ryan. And thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12, growing at 15% and representing EPS leverage of 1,120 basis points.
Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower-than-expected revenue as we await new product introductions. Despite this revenue shortfall, we produced strong improvement in operating margins and double-digit earnings per share growth. While some of the challenges that had an impact on revenue in Q2 could persist over the coming quarters, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth not only in our current fiscal year but on a sustained basis into the future.
Now normally, the diversity of our revenue base overcomes any quarterly challenges. However, there were enough unexpected and unrelated issues in Q2 to collectively affect our revenue and each of our growth vectors. Our new therapies growth vector, which contributed approximately 195 basis points to our total company growth, not only just fell below our goal of 200 to 350 basis points but was well below our trend and expectations, with the largest impacts from CVG and Diabetes. In CVG, revenue growth was 3%, below our targeted high end of the mid-single-digit range and meaningfully below what we believe this business should be able to sustain. 
In our CRHF division, strong growth contributions from diagnostics, atrial fibrillation and our recently acquired Heartware LVAD business were offset by weakness in our core cardiac rhythm implantables business, which declined in the low single digits. While we continued to take share in the U.S. ICD market, the market itself declined in the mid-single digits, driven by high single-digit market declines in high-power device replacements. In the U.K., our implantables revenue declined in the mid-teens as the National Health Service is changing its procurement model to limit bulk purchases, causing a temporary disruption to normal buying patterns of the local trusts. We expect these pressures in CRHF to continue through the fiscal year.
Our CSH division was affected by transient market share losses due to the timing of new product cycles. For example, in the fast-growing TAVR market, we lagged, until recently, a large-sized version of our Evolut R platform. And in drug-eluting stents, our new Resolute Onyx DES is not yet available in the U.S. and Japan, driving declines in both markets to competitive DES products. However, at the end of this quarter, we did receive FDA approval for Evolut R XL, which we expect to drive U.S. growth in the back half of our fiscal year. In addition, we expect the introduction of Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around fiscal year-end and Resolute Onyx in Japan in FY '18.
In our APV division, solid mid-single-digit growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, which continues to lead the market and drive mid-20s growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of our fiscal year.
Within our Diabetes Group, we were pleased with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of the MiniMED 670G, which not only represents revolutionary technology toward a long-awaited closed-loop insulin pump system but also has been received with strong enthusiasm amongst the diabetes community. However, the earlier-than-expected approval has created a bigger-than-expected gap between product approval and shipment. As a result, we created a priority access program for the 630G, which offers upgrade priority to the 670G when launched. We are seeing strong demand for this program, primarily from early adopters. 
We do expect the majority of customers to wait to purchase the 670G once it launches in the spring of 2017. In addition to this dynamic, which is driving lower-than-expected pump and consumable sales, a portion of our 630G revenue is now deferred until receipt of the upgrade. Going forward, we expect some improved revenue growth for the remainder of this fiscal year, and we expect diabetes to ultimately return to double-digit growth once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 4% in Q2, consistent with our goal of mid-single-digit revenue growth, primarily driven by our Open-to-MIS growth driver, including strong product sales of our recently launched Valleylab F10 -- FT10 energy platform and continued performance of our endostapling specialty reloads. Surgical solutions came in slightly below our expectations, primarily driven by the impact of competitive reprocessing of our Advanced Energy vessels healing disposals -- disposables in the U.S. We are confident in our ongoing strategies and new product launches that are designed to address this headwind. 
Looking ahead, MITG expects to launch more than 15 new products in the second half of the fiscal year to drive growth, including a new powered stapling platform called Signia and new vessel-sealing enhancements. This pipeline gives us confidence that MITG can continue to grow in the mid-single digits in the back half of the fiscal year.
Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 3% this quarter, and our Spine division continued to show improvement. Overall, Spine growth was 1%, our strongest growth in 7 quarters as we gained global spine share. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3%, driven by continued adoption of INFUSE and strong adoption of our Speed to Scale launches and Surgical Synergy strategy, resulting in share gains, along with sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in neurosurgery. RTG did suffer from a voluntary recall of certain neurovascular products, which affected revenue. Some of these products will remain off the market in certain geographies for a period of time, but the most substantial impact of the recall is behind us as we bought back existing distributor inventory in Q2.
Across all of our groups, our product pipeline remains robust. We have important new growth catalysts that we expect to lead to improved second half growth. Some of these products have already been launched, and others are coming to the market in the coming months. We are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector and expect to be well within our 200 to 350 basis point goal in the back half of the year and over the longer term.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets, which grew 10% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our total company growth, slightly below our goal of 150 to 200 basis points. The primary driver was a shortfall in the Middle East, where our revenue declined in the mid-single digits as governments are dealing with an increased deficit, affected by declining oil prices. In Saudi Arabia, the largest market in the region and where we have a strong market leadership position, our overall business declined by approximately 40%, mostly impacting our CRHF, Surgical Solutions and Spine divisions. We expect continued pressure in the Middle East for the remainder of the year, but we also believe that the basic demand for our critical life-saving therapies will eventually rebound strongly.
On the positive side, our businesses in South Asia, ASEAN, Eastern Europe and Latin America all grew in the mid-teens or higher. China, our largest emerging market, grew 11%, with a double-digit growth in MITG and Diabetes and high single-digit growth in CVG and RTG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we grew again in the low-20s, with strong growth coming from key tender wins in MITG. In ASEAN, growth was broad-based, with double-digit growth in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Eastern Europe, we grew over 20% in Russia as a result of strong momentum in CVG and MITG. Latin America also had strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, driven in part by new tender wins and continued channel optimization efforts. We expect current emerging market performance levels to be sustained in the back half of the year and continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.
Turning now to our third growth vector, Services & Solutions, which contributed 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve solid revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings.
We expect to further improve our growth contribution as new models are created and expanded across all our regions. We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, through which we provide expertise in creating operational efficiency in both cath labs and operating rooms. We're also continuing to grow our chronic care models, including Diabeter for type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid obesity, by pursuing global expansion opportunities. And finally, we formally launched our Orthopedic Solutions business earlier this month, a comprehensive program to help providers meet their CJR requirements in the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me reiterate that we are disappointed with our Q2 performance. That said, we also believe that these headwind events were largely temporary in nature, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth for the full year. What should not be lost in this discussion is that, despite revenue challenges this quarter, our organization delivered strong improvements in operating margins, including improvements in our gross margin and SG&A, and met our goal of delivering double-digit EPS growth. 
Karen will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results. Karen?"

Our second quarter revenue of $7,345,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant-currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approxim",1311,"Thank you, Omar. Our second quarter revenue of $7,345,000,000 increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant-currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue, and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately 120 basis points net to revenue growth. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.06 impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 15%. Strong operating performance helped offset the revenue shortfall in the quarter. And the majority of a tax benefit during the quarter was offset by a worse-than-expected impact of foreign exchange on earnings.
In addition to the $385 million adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $24 million charge for the Heartware acquisition fair market value inventory step-up; and a $35 million restructuring charge; and a $2 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien, along with expenses related to our acquisition of Heartware, offset by a net gain from the adjustments of our contingent consideration on prior acquisitions.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 28.9% on a constant-currency basis, representing a strong 150 basis point year-over-year improvement. Efficiencies in both the gross margin and SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies, drove the increase. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings in the fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.
Net other expense was $89 million compared to $57 million in the prior year, reflecting about $90 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year, primarily due to our hedging program, partially offset by a $48 million reduction in the U.S. medical device tax. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, FX can create modest volatility to the P&L above the operating margin line. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility throughout the P&L. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our plans to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margins this fiscal year.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $173 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $32.4 billion in debt and $11.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 14.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included $42 million of operational net tax benefits, primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with the prior impairment of an investment in a foreign subsidiary. While we have had tax benefits in both Q1 and Q2, we continue to forecast a tax rate of approximately 17% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with a focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $593 million in dividends and repurchased a net $985 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. This represented a total payout ratio of 101% on non-GAAP net income and 142% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind our payout ratio is elevated as we not only return 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute on our commitment to return $5 billion through incremental share repurchases by the end of fiscal year '18. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 39 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,393,000,000 shares.
Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our outlook. 
As Omar mentioned, we continue to expect to deliver mid-single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth this fiscal year, and we expect our revenue growth to improve from the disappointing growth this past quarter. However, given the issues we outlined in the second quarter, some of which could persist in the near term, we now expect our full year revenue growth to be within the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency, constant-weeks basis as opposed to the upper half of that range signaled previously.
Moving to the back half of the fiscal year. We expect revenue growth to also be in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis. With regard to our business groups, we continue to expect MITG to grow in the mid-single digits, and we expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid-single-digit range, ramping in the back half of the year. While we expect improvement from the headwinds faced in CVG and Diabetes in the second quarter, we recognize that, until some of our important new products officially launch, revenue growth is likely to continue to be affected. For that reason, in the back half of this fiscal year, we expect CVG to deliver mid-single digit and Diabetes to deliver mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. 
Keep in mind that CVG had a strong finish to last fiscal year, so on an annual comparison basis, we expect slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter. And because we do not expect the 670G to be on the market until the end of this fiscal year, we expect growth in Diabetes to ramp through the back half, with stronger growth in the fourth quarter than the third. We continue to expect diabetes to ultimately reach double-digit revenue growth, as signaled in the past, once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and, therefore, not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which include $1.06 euro and JPY 110, remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our full year revenue to be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $60 million, including an approximate $10 million to $30 million negative impact in the third quarter. 
With respect to earnings, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth on a constant-currency, constant-week basis for the full fiscal year. For the back half of the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth to be in the 8% to 10% range on a constant-currency basis, given slightly less than previously expected revenue, a more normal 17% expected tax rate and the loss of the year-over-year benefit from a lower medical device tax starting in December. Taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week in the first quarter last fiscal year as well as an estimated negative foreign currency impact to our full year EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 if current exchange rates remain stable, this EPS growth implies full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.55 to $4.60.
Lastly, we are modifying our free cash flow outlook methodology. Recall that last quarter, we were focusing -- we were forecasting an adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal year '17, a range that would exclude cash payments related to non-GAAP items that might occur during the year. Going forward, we will include these items to more closely align our free cash flow projection with the results we report each quarter. However, in light of the unpredictability of the precise amount and timing of cash payments, we are expanding the range.

First, we are disappointed in our revenue performance this quarter. The issues that caused the shortfall are identifiable and, in many cases, temporary. As I mentioned, we have several new product introductions in the back half of the year that we expect to drive our revenue growth back to our normal range. 
Second, despite our revenue challenges, our organization delivered an operational discipline, including driving the expected Covidien synergies, which led to strong operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. And third, looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year but on a sustained basis in the future. And as always, we remain focused on creating long-term dependable value for our shareholders.
We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us.  [Operator Instructions] If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call.

I think probably the best way to think about kind of the one question investors are going to have today is on the U.S. business. And so if we looked at U.S. growth corporate-wide on an organic basis, it's basically flat this quarter. So I'd love to hear just kind of the group's thoughts on the health of the U.S. device market and what appears to be some slowdown, at least reflected in your results and some other companies' results over the last quarter."

Like I mentioned earlier, in CVG, we just launched the Evolut R XL, which will contribute to U.S. growth in the second half, and also, the introduction of the Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of the fiscal year. You mentioned diabetes. That's primarily a U.S. launch on the 670G, so that, we think, again, will have a big impact on the market. And the slowdown in diabetes was mostly in the U.S., again, which, again, impacted the overall market. In MITG, we're launching over 15 new products in the second half to drive growth. And in RTG, our continued drive on our Speed to Scale launches and so on, in addition to our sales in navigation and imaging, should all help the U.S. So we think this is a lot in our own control, and through successful execution of new product introductions, I think we'll make an impact."

So maybe just -- if you just want to kind of comment on that. And then just the follow-up, unrelated to the actual quarter, is I know there are a lot of questions coming out of the outcome of the U.S. election and the potential for corporate tax reform.

First, from a Surgical Solutions perspective, while it is a barometer on the overall market, there were greater activity than we usually have on reprocessing, which -- and for which we're addressing that through some new launches in the second half. So we think that will impact the market. And again, like I said before, because we are so big in the market, it does move the overall market up and down depending on what we do. I really don't have any hard data to comment on the overall procedures that would really worry me as a big factor. I think our own performance is the bigger thing here. With respect to the other points, Mike, it's too early for me to comment on any changes and so on. I mean, in the end, we go back to our universal health care needs, improving clinical outcomes, driving value-based health care, increasing access. Irrespective of the government and irrespective of the country, for that matter, those are the priorities, and that's what we stay focused on. I think as long as any reform focuses on that, I think it will be accepted and will be successful. It's not easy, but it's one that we must collectively address. With respect to the tax situation, again, I don't want to speculate on what may or may not happen here. But I just want to reiterate that the reason we did the Covidien acquisition was operational. It was primarily driven by market synergies and broadening of our business and the way in which we can drive health care forward. At that time, that was the best structure, and we continue to believe that, that is the right way for us in getting access to our cash, which we've deployed effectively. I'm just going to leave it at that. We'll see how things roll out, and we'll kind of go from there. But like I've said many times before, we like to control the things that we can control and execute those well. The rest will happen around us, and it's tough for me to speculate."

In fact, the pacing market was pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So the High Power side of the equation, we saw slightly lower growth in initial implants, but we're now looking at high single-digit declines in replacements for the market. And that's something different than we have seen historically. As we go forward, we think that we're in a particularly impacted area for CRT and that, that will get better going forward. But we also expect on the High Power side for standard ICDs that there will be this replacement headwind. That's principally coming from the fact that there was lower device implants 5, 7 years ago when these devices were being put in, in terms of initial trajectory. But an even more important impact is the lengthening life of these devices because of improvements that we've made to the technology to extend their battery life, and that will be a bit of a headwind for us going forward. But what's going to work in our favor is pipeline. We -- if you remember from TCT, in the first half of the year, I think across all of our businesses within CVG, I think we probably had 4 -- 4 or 5 new product introductions in major geographies. That's going to go up to about 25 in the back half, with some very important ones in the device implantables area, including extending the 3T MRI, bringing the Visia AF to Japan and a large number of other ones that I mentioned at TCT and identified as being a catalyst for us going forward. So I think those are going to be things that we can count on to help our share position and, hopefully, also help with market growth."

David, with the 630G, your question specifically, look, what I would say is once we had this product in the hands of our sales team and in front of physicians and patients, we actually saw good momentum with the product. Maybe just to provide a reminder, this was approved in early August. And it takes few weeks to demo it, to get it in front of the sales team, to get it in front of physicians, and that makes August for us a tough comparison. Then when we get the 670 approved, which was much earlier than expected, we implemented the priority access program. And we saw, as the commentary suggested, some good uptick with respect to that, but primarily from early adopters. So I think if you take a look at it on balance, I think the 630, once it was in the marketplace, performed well. I think our dynamic, which was purely U.S.-based, was the fact that in less than 2 months, we had 2 major product approvals in the same geography. And there's operational transition that comes with this, and there's a degree of, I would say, perhaps confusion and disruption to demand because of that. And that was really the biggest catalyst. Now going forward, we still remain very excited that the enthusiasm around the 670 is great. So we think that, as the commentary suggested, we're going to ramp, but once this thing is full scale, we'll return to double-digit growth."

And love if you could elaborate a little bit on that and maybe where you see -- if you see the application of that in other areas. And then I had one follow-up."

But the main overriding comment I want to make is that the example that you state is an -- is truly an example of value-based health care. And value-based health care means that we become a company who are paid for outcomes as opposed to the product itself. That's a long-term journey, but eventually, we think that, that's the right thing for health care, that's the right thing for us. It will make us a more efficient team in our R&D. And we'll get rewarded for what we innovate, and health care will get the right value and -- in the long term, outcomes and lower cost. So that model, you'll see us replicate in many other areas and -- like I've described in the chronic care world with the Diabeter and with the NOK, and we've talked a lot about our antibacterial sleeve, which also has the same kind of model. So you'll see a lot of these things from us, these value-based health care models. And that one example which you state is only the beginning. I think our size helps us with a seat at the table to do these contracts. And so I think it'll give us a differentiated advantage, not only because of our size but because of our ability to innovate and link them to outcomes. Mike, any quick specifics on the particular examples to give?"

And those strategies cover our ability to produce new products across a variety of market segments. Typically, that diversity would protect us. It just so happened this quarter that a collection of them all happened together. In addition to that, we've got geographic diversity, which we're building, and that's our drive towards emerging markets, where we've actually, even with the enormous impact in Saudi, still delivered close to -- at 10% emerging market growth, short of our overall sort of basis point target of 150 to 200 but one that we think will pick up over time. And we want to get more to the middle of that target rather than the low end. And the Services & Solutions are a longer-term effort, but, again, another one which will give us sustained growth in the long term. So we're deploying multiple strategies for sustained and consistent mid-single-digit growth, which employs addressing new therapies, cadence of product innovation, different market segments within that, geographic diversification, a real focus on emerging markets and creating this new Services & Solutions growth vector, along the lines that you described earlier based on our value-based health care initiatives.

So we do think that a significant shift in our new product cadence will give us enough growth to take us well within the single-digit range in the back half. And also, we haven't talked much about it, but the improvement in Spine and the RTG growth starts to move up to the mid-single-digit range, which it wasn't before. So all of these are the main factors. To be clear, look, we stated that the device replacement market in ICDs will continue to slow. We're not expecting that to turn around. We expect the NHS and the buying patterns in the U.K. to remain slow for the remainder of the year. We expect the Middle East to remain where it is.

But before I finish, I have to repeat the 3 main points about this call and about our performance and outlook. 
Like I've said several times, we're not happy about the revenue performance this quarter, but we do think that the shortfall -- the reasons for the shortfall are identifiable and, in most cases, temporary. And we expect our new product introductions primarily to drive a recovery in the back half of the year and in -- longer term. Second, look, please acknowledge -- we acknowledge the fact that our organization delivered an operational discipline and delivered strong operating margin and double-digit EPS growth this quarter. And finally, we remain confident in our overall strategy that we laid out in our analyst meeting, double-digit -- mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth on a constant-currency basis not only this fiscal year but sustained into the future, and that is something that we're certainly not coming off. 
Okay. So with that, I'd like to thank you all for your interest and your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, also thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 21. Thank you."
