Our outlook for full-year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billi",696,"[Audio Gap]
We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single digit range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full-year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $1.23 per share at the midpoint from previous expectations and is driven by an approximate $0.30 per share reduction due to higher than previously anticipated cost associated with our CMSR response and higher medical costs in our individual business and an approximate $0.90 per share reduction due to higher claim cost in our Group Disability and Life business. 
To provide greater transparency within our outlook, we are introducing segment-level guidance for full year 2016. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care's earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2016 customer growth in the low single-digit percentage range. 
Turning to medical costs. Our 2016 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization, which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continued to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. 
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%. The MCR outlook reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business and some continued pressure in individual medical cost. 
For our total government book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85%, reflecting the continued benefit of our physician engagement model within our Seniors business. 
Regarding operating expenses. We expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which includes the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. 
For our global supplemental benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth on a currency-adjusted basis and earnings in the range of $255 million to $275 million. 
Regarding the Group Disability and Life business. We now expect full year earnings in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $80 million. Group Disability and Life earnings are well below our previous expectations and reflect results to date and continuing pressure over the balance of the year. 
Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $175 million for 2016. 
So all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. 
I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS between the third and fourth quarter to be more evenly distributed than historical patterns. And I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior reserve development or any future capital deployment. 
Regarding free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes.  Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook are strong and remain in line with our expectations. 
Now to recap. The fundamentals of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses remain strong. We are also taking the appropriate steps to address the challenges we're facing in Group Disability and Life. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised full year 2016 earnings outlook. 
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

First, just to frame, our group insurance business has been a strong and consistent performer. We recognize we're having an audit pattern year. We understand that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're taking specific steps to improve that. Let me talk about disability first and then life, and I think I'll put all your questions into that context. From the disability standpoint, first, we made operating changes to our business processes. Very importantly, these are not systemic changes or changes in technology. These are business process changes, started at the first quarter of this year, with the goal of improving our customer service, driving further efficiency and effectiveness over the long term, all while complying with emerging regulatory best practices. It's clear that the operational disruption is more significant and prolonged than we had planned for. Importantly, our customers continue to see good, strong service. However, as we noted, the financials had suffered. We're already seeing improvement in the patterns as we go through the second quarter. So we see the pattern improving and expect to continue to see that improve throughout 2016 and as we step into 2017. These are not catch-up for prior year claims. Don't think about it that way. Its operational process changes of meaningful magnitude. And we're already seeing improvements to the pattern. And we will see improvements throughout '16 and into '17. Relative to the life book, your basic hypothesis is right. We have a meaningful book that over time has performed very well. Unfortunately, from time to time, our life book of business has a temporary dislocation of spike. The second quarter this year was one of those years. Order of magnitude, operating lives in the quarter, about $45 million after tax. It's important to note that the claims did settle back, generally speaking, within historical patterns by the end of the second quarter. Additionally, as you'd expect, we conducted a variety of detailed analysis to see if there were any other unique causes to the pattern we saw the spike. And we found none. Also, as we noted, we completed our reserve study in the second quarter. That resulted in a reserve strengthening of about $17 million after tax. So when you think about life taken together from an operating standpoint and from the reserve standpoint, altogether, a little more than $60 million after tax. So net-net, clearly not happy with the results. We clearly believe they're temporary. Life will recover more quickly for the reasons you stated, and disability will continue to recover throughout the remaining portion of 2016 and into 2017. As to the latter part of your question, you can think about the current year change in the outlook as split roughly 50-50 between the two lines of business."

To your point, we fully recognize the tremendous capital as in free cash flow as well as capital through balance sheet leverage flexibility we built over the last several years. In the event, taking your statement that the DOJ process is not successful, our view is that, as we look toward the second half and latter part of 2017, we'd have $5 billion, a bit more than $5 billion of deployable cash, plus a balance sheet in the current situation that sits at about 27% leverage. Our view is that, normal course of business, we could add 10 points to that leverage. For strategic M&A, you could add 15 points to that leverage. So taken together, truly tremendous value-creation opportunity for shareholders in the event the DOJ process is not successful. We fully understand that.

Very fair. So let's take it on reverse order. Let's take life first. If you look at the life industry, players in the life industry, unfortunately, book of business will experience short-term temporary spikes on dislocations and costs. It transpires. Ideally, we like that not to happen because we want consistent, predictable environment. So to add to your point, as we noted, that spike took place in the early portion of the second quarter. And as I noted in my prepared remarks and my comments, we saw a reversion of the life pattern within historical ranges towards the latter part of the quarter. Secondly, we did significant analysis to try to determine whether or not there were any unique drivers of that, as you'd expect. And we didn't find any. And thirdly, there was a reserve study, which while it triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening, a way of looking at it otherwise, it only triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening. Specific to disability, you're right. We flagged this last quarter. There are operating changes that we put in place, as we noted. The results stepped down meaningfully in the first quarter. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've already seen progress in the second quarter relative to the improvement, albeit at a slower pace than we would like or projected. And we expect to continue to see that progress going forward. And that offsets, ultimately, the longer claim durations and the incurrence rates that we're incurring currently as well as the elevated claim inventory. So important to note, we are seeing improvement in the disability results through the second quarter and expect that pattern to continue throughout the remaining portion of this year and into 2017."

Our #1 priority, though, is to get this issue fully remediated and create a sustainable platform for the growth and the ongoing performance we expect for many years to come. So ultimately, what transpired is more complexity to the work necessary to build the sustainability that we want for the growth profile we see over the long term. But the operations and the day-to-day fundamentals of the earnings performance of the base book of business continues to be strong. As it relates to the individual book of business, I'll ask Tom to talk about the financials. But as you recall, we continue to take a very focused and disciplined view to the marketplace, primarily because we viewed from day 1, the 2014, '15 and '16, would be as, we call, the version 1.0 of the marketplace, underscored by a smaller aggregate size than was initially projected.

But much of that is onetime spend to get us through the remediation period. And I don't think we see any significant impact on our bid related to that dynamic."

Important to note, we have seen the performance of what we look at as our newest offerings as remarkably better than the traditional offerings that we had placed in the market in many other markets. So those new offerings are aided or driven by very focused and a collaborative delivery system models. And those are performing better. As it relates to 2017, you're right. First and foremost, at this point, we planned for and expected to continue to participate. We've taken posture to position ourselves in a limited number of new markets, where we have the ability to put in place those aligned collaborative delivery system models. Also relative to the disruption we're seeing from a results standpoint, we continue to have active engagement and dialogue with both CMS and state agencies to ensure that we're mutually enabled to be focused on those areas and programs where we could address the sustained value, which really are pivoting off those collaborative delivery system models. We would expect to improve our performance year-over-year. But this is a volatile marketplace, which is why we kept it as a relatively speaking small portion of our portfolio."

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. 
In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.10 per share for merger-related transaction costs. And we reported this charge as a special item. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of second quarter 2016 results. 
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical cost. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It's been over a year since we've held formal earnings call due to our pending combination. And clearly, much has happened.

It's been over a year since we've held formal earnings call due to our pending combination. And clearly, much has happened. We wanted to take the opportunity to connect directly with you, first, to reaffirm our goals and how we are delivering on our strategy; second, to provide an update around this quarter's results and the actions we are taking to remedy the specific performance headwind that has caused us to miss our expectation; and third, to provide some perspective regarding the actions from U.S. Department of Justice to block our proposed combination with Anthem. 
After I share my remarks, Tom will briefly highlight our second quarter financial results and updated outlook in more detail. And we'll take your questions. After that, I'll leave you with a few closing thoughts following the Q&A portion of the call. 
I'd like to begin by underscoring that over the past year, our goals have been clear. First and foremost, to continue to effectively run and operate our businesses with a focus on our customers and clients and on delivering long-term value for you, our shareholders. Second, to support and guide the proposed transaction through the regulatory process as Anthem leads that process and we support it. And third, keep the company well positioned with optionality in a variety of scenarios given the uncertainty around the regulatory approval process. 
We are delivering on our strategy. We have maintained focus and continue to grow and invest in our businesses while delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients. And until this quarter, deliver on our shareholder commitments. While our results underperformed expectations in the second quarter, to be clear, our diversified businesses remain grounded in solid fundamentals. And we continue to innovate and deliver a notable array of capabilities that are truly differentiated. Our relationships with employers, providers and partners continue to strengthen. We continue to add new customer relationships in addition to maintaining high retention levels for existing customer and clients. We are maintaining a strong pipeline for future growth in all of our businesses, and we continue to generate [indiscernible] historical levels of deployable capital and balance sheet capability. 
While this is our immediate backdrop, it is important to remember our long-term strategic goal of 10% to 13% compounded annual growth on average for earnings per share. And over the last 6 years, we've delivered 13%, which is at the high end of that range. 
I'll now turn to our results in the second quarter. Our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business delivered strong 2016 second quarter financial results for our portfolio, which were tempered by disappointing performance in our Group Disability & Life segment. Our second quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $10 billion over the second quarter 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the second quarter of $515 million or $1.98 per share. Our revenue growth is fully aligned with our expectations. However, the earnings were pressured by temporary impacts on our Group Disability and Life segment. 
Given that as a backdrop, let's discuss our group operations, specifically performance, issues and actions. The quarterly results were significantly below our expectations in both Disability and Life businesses. The poor performance in Disability is a result of modifications made to the disability claim process coming into the first quarter of this year, where we are investing additional resources in the upfront medical review of claims to conduct further physical examinations, perform deeper medical history views and enhance documentation. 
These modifications has resulted in longer claim cycles, thereby increasing the disability durations and our claim inventory, which has contributed significantly to the unfavorable financial impact we have experienced in the first half of 2016 for this business. We are currently making the investments necessary to strengthen the operational processes in a manner that will provide an improved customer experience as we lower claim volatility and further improve the quality of decisions, all at lower operating cost. 
While we've yet to realize the long-term benefits associated with these changes, it is important to recognize that they are both customer friendly and aligned with regulatory best practices. As a result, our disability operating results are expected to improve over the balance of 2016 and into 2017 as these changes take hold. And Cigna's differentiated disability model with the unique focus on productivity and health continues to deliver value for our customers and clients, as evidenced by our sustained growth and stable performance up to this point. 
Now to round our group insurance and to add to the disability pressure in the second quarter, our Group Disability and Life earnings were significantly impacted by unfavorable life claims. While claims emerged unfavorably early in the quarter, claims in the last month of the quarter were more in line with our expectations. 
It is important to note for context we have had periods of life claims volatility in the past and expect life claims to run closer to historic levels over the balance of the year, due in part by the rapid reversion of the short-term spike in claims to historical levels and some reserve strengthening of pricing actions that we're taking. 
We understand the results in this business did not meet your expectations. And to be clear, they did not meet ours. We are taking actions to ensure they will improve and they present an earnings trajectory opportunity for us as we look to the future. 
Additionally, and importantly, our client and customer performance has been strong despite the financial impact of these challenges in the second quarter. Overall, our group Disability and Life business remains an important part of our portfolio. 
As for the rest of our portfolio, we continue to post strength in our employee health care book and our Global Supplemental business. While U.S. Individual business has experienced softness similar to the rest of the industry, overall, our commercial book of business is performing well. Additionally, our U.S. Medicare book continues to perform in line with our expectations, recognizing we did incur increased temporary cost associates with our CMS audit issue. 
Now turning briefly to our pending combination. As you've recently seen, the United States Department of Justice has sued to block the proposed combination with Anthem. Given the nature of the concerns raised by the DOJ and the overall status of the regulatory process, which under the merger agreement is led by Anthem, we stepped back briefly to evaluate our options, consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement. 
As part of this evaluation, we obviously sought to deeply understand the various and significant concerns of the DOJ and the states that have joined on as well as the path to possibly address their broad and specific concerns. So to be clear, we have and will continue to fulfill our contractual obligations. If there is a successful combination to be completed, it is clearly our intent and commitment to continue to provide the support, as we have, dedicating significant resources, time and effort to do so. If there is not a combination to be completed, we will seek to improve shareholder value by accelerating growth in our core strong performing businesses, improve the results of our underperforming businesses, seek to pursue additional growth opportunities, and finally, seek -- further create shareholder value with a tremendous capital flexibility we have created over the last several years. 
Reflecting on all these challenges and the criticality of the work we do, which impacts more than 90 million customer relationships around the world, I'd also like to take a moment to thank the Cigna team and recognize their steadfast passion, resilience and focus on our customers and clients during the past year. 
Now to summarize. Cigna's performance this quarter includes solid revenue and earning contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and performance from our Group Disability and Life segment that did not meet our expectations. We believe these results will improve meaningfully over the remaining 2016 and 2017 timeframe. 
Our highly engaged, passionate and extremely resilient team will continue to create value for our customers and clients by leveling the strength of our diversified businesses and our differentiated capabilities. We remain committed to our long-term objective to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while continuing to invest in our company's business portfolio. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. 
Overall, key highlights in the quarter are: consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10 billion; consolidated earnings of $515 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.98; and continued strong capital efficiency and free cash flow in line with our full-year expectations. 
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Second quarter premiums and fees grew to $6.9 billion. Second quarter earnings were $486 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth and continued favorable medical cost and quality outcomes, particularly in our Commercial Employer Group business. These drivers were partially offset by higher medical costs in our individual business and increased cost related to our Medicare Advantage CMS audit response. 
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. On a currency-adjusted basis, premiums and fees grew 12% and earnings grew 15% quarter-over-quarter to $83 million. This was another strong quarter for our Global Supplemental Benefits business. 
Group Disability and Life reported a second quarter loss of $12 million. Results in the second quarter reflect the continued impact of modifications to our disability claims process and poor experience in group life claims. While second quarter results in our disability business were better than results in the first quarter, the improvement was less than we had expected. Results in the Group Life business were also below expectations. We experienced elevated claims early in the quarter, while life claims were more in line with the expectation later in the quarter. 
This quarter's results also included a $17 million after-tax unfavorable impact from a reserve study on our Life business. And for comparative purposes, the second quarter of 2015 results included a $37 million after tax favorable impact from our reserve study on our Group Disability business, resulting in a $54 million after tax unfavorable variance from reserve studies quarter-over-quarter. 
Over the balance of the year, we expect life claims experience to run closer to the historical levels. And we continue to expect disability results to improve, but at a slower pace than previously expected, as the process modifications implemented in the first quarter take time to mature and long-term benefits begin to emerge. 
Overall, our second quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and continuing pressure in the Group Disability and Life results.  We also continue to generate strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility. 
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016.  We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single digit range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full-year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $1.23 per share at the midpoint from previous expectations and is driven by an approximate $0.30 per share reduction due to higher than previously anticipated cost associated with our CMSR [ph] response and higher medical costs in our individual business and an approximate $0.90 per share reduction due to higher claim cost in our Group Disability and Life business. 
To provide greater transparency within our outlook, we are introducing segment-level guidance for full year 2016. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care's earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2016 customer growth in the low single-digit percentage range. 
Turning to medical costs. Our 2016 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization, which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. 
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%. The MCR outlook reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business and some continued pressure in individual medical cost. 
For our total government book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85%, reflecting the continued benefit of our physician engagement model within our Seniors business. 
Regarding operating expenses. We expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which includes the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. 
For our global supplemental benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth on a currency-adjusted basis and earnings in the range of $255 million to $275 million. 
Regarding the Group Disability and Life business. We now expect full year earnings in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $80 million. Group Disability and Life earnings are well below our previous expectations and reflect results to date and continuing pressure over the balance of the year. 
Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $175 million for 2016. 
So all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. 
I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS between the third and fourth quarter to be more evenly distributed than historical patterns. And I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior reserve development or any future capital deployment. 
Regarding free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes.  Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook are strong and remain in line with our expectations. 
Now to recap. The fundamentals of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses remain strong. We are also taking the appropriate steps to address the challenges we are facing in Group Disability and Life. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised full year 2016 earnings outlook. 
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

First, just to frame, our group insurance business has been a strong and consistent performer. We recognize we're having an audit pattern year. We understand that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're taking specific steps to improve that. Let me talk about disability first and then life, and I think I'll put all your questions into that context. From the disability standpoint, first, we made operating changes to our business processes. Very importantly, these are not systemic changes or changes in technology. These are business process changes, started at the first quarter this year, with the goal of improving our customer service, driving further efficiency and effectiveness over the long term, all while complying with emerging regulatory best practices. It's clear that the operational disruption is more significant and prolonged than we had planned for. Importantly, our customers continue to see good, strong service. However, as we noted, the financials had suffered. We're already seeing improvement in the patterns as we go through the second quarter. So we see the pattern improving and expect to continue to see that improve throughout 2016 and as we step into 2017. These are not catch-up for prior year claims. Don't think about it that way. Its operational process changes of meaningful magnitude. And we're already seeing improvements to the pattern. And we will see improvements throughout '16 and into '17. Relative to the life book, your basic hypothesis is right. We have a meaningful book that over time has performed very well. Unfortunately, from time to time, our life book of business has a temporary dislocation of spike. The second quarter this year was one of those years. Order of magnitude, operating lives in the quarter, about $45 million after tax. It's important to note that the claims did settle back, generally speaking, within historical patterns by the end of the second quarter. Additionally, as you'd expect, we conducted a variety of detailed analysis to see if there were any other unique causes to the pattern we saw spike, and we found none. Also as we noted, we completed our reserve study in the second quarter. That resulted in a reserve strengthening of about $17 million after tax. So when you think about life taken together from an operating standpoint and from the reserve standpoint, altogether, a little more than $60 million after tax. So net-net, clearly not happy with the results. We clearly believe they're temporary. Life will recover more quickly for the reasons you stated, and disability will continue to recover throughout the remaining portion of 2016 and into 2017. As to the latter part of your question, you can think about the current year change in the outlook as split roughly 50-50 between the two lines of business."

In the event, taking your statement that the DOJ process is not successful, our view is that as we look toward the second half and latter part of 2017, we'd have $5 billion, a bit more than $5 billion of deployable cash, plus a balance sheet in the current situation that sits at about 27% leverage. Our view is that normal course of business, we could add 10 points to that leverage. For strategic M&A, you could add 15 points to that leverage. So taken together, truly tremendous value-creation opportunity for shareholders in the event the DOJ process is not successful. We fully understand that. And we'd expect to responsibly deploy that."

So let's take it in reverse order. Let's take life first. If you look at the life industry, players in the life industry unfortunately, it's the nature of book of business, will experience short-term temporary spikes or dislocations in costs. It transpires. Ideally, we like that not to happen because we want consistent, predictable environment. So to add to your point, as we noted, that spike took place in the early portion of the second quarter. And as I noted in my prepared remarks and my comments, we saw a reversion of the life pattern within historical ranges towards the latter part of the quarter. Secondly, we did significant analysis to try to determine whether or not there were any unique drivers of that, as you'd expect. And we didn't find any. And thirdly, there was a reserve study, which, while it triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening, a way of looking at it otherwise, it only triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening. Specific to disability, you're right. We flagged this last quarter. There are operating changes that we put in place, as we noted. The results stepped down meaningfully in the first quarter. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've already seen progress in the second quarter relative to the improvement, albeit at a slower pace than we would like or projected. And we expect to continue to see that progress going forward. And that offsets, ultimately, the longer claim durations and the incurrence rates that we're incurring currently as well as the elevated claim inventory. So important to note, we are seeing improvement in the disability results through the second quarter and expect that pattern to continue throughout the remaining portion of this year and into 2017."

Our #1 priority, though, is to get this issue fully remediated and create the sustainable platform for the growth and the ongoing performance we expect for many years to come. So ultimately, what transpired is more complexity to the work necessary to build the sustainability that we want for the growth profile we see over the long term. But the operations and the day-to-day fundamentals of the earnings performance of the base book of business continues to be strong. As it relates to the individual book of business, I'll ask Tom to talk about the financials. But as you recall, we continue to take a very focused and disciplined view of the marketplace, primarily because we viewed from day 1, that 2014, '15 and '16, would be as we call it version 1.0 of the marketplace, underscored by a smaller aggregate size than was initially projected.

So that kind of gives you an order of magnitude of the size of the total spend we're talking about. We haven't mentioned exactly the overall outlook for the year. But you can -- based on that spend, you can expect a sizable amount. Some of that probably does end up back in the run rate as we -- at least in the near term, as we institute more robust processes.

Important to note, we have seen the performance of what we look at as our newest offerings as being remarkably better than the traditional offerings that we had placed in the market and many have in the market. So those new offerings are aided or driven by very focused and aligned collaborative delivery system models. And those are performing better. As it relates to 2017, you're right. First and foremost, at this point, we planned for and expected to continue to participate. We've taken posture to position ourselves in a limited number of new markets, where we have the ability to put in place those aligned collaborative delivery system models. But also relative to the disruption we're seeing from a result standpoint, we continue to have active engagement and dialogue with both CMS and state agencies to ensure that we're mutually enabled to be focused on those areas and programs where we could address the sustained value, which really are pivoting off those collaborative delivery system models. We would expect to improve our performance year-over-year. But this is a volatile marketplace, which is why we kept it as a relatively speaking small portion of our portfolio."

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. 
In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.10 per share for merger-related transaction costs. And we reported this charge as a special item. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of second quarter 2016 results. 
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It's been over a year since we've held a formal earnings call due to our pending combination, and, clearly, much has happened.

It's been over a year since we've held a formal earnings call due to our pending combination, and, clearly, much has happened. We wanted to take the opportunity to connect directly with you first, to reaffirm our goals and how we are delivering on our strategy; second, to provide an update around this quarter's results and the actions we are taking to remedy the specific performance headwind that has caused us to miss our expectations; and third, to provide some perspective regarding the actions from the U.S. Department of Justice to block our proposed combination with Anthem. 
After I share my remarks, Tom will briefly highlight our second quarter financial results and updated outlook in more detail, and we'll take your questions. After that, I'll leave you with a few closing thoughts following the Q&A portion of the call. 
I'd like to begin by underscoring that over the past year, our goals have been clear. First and foremost, to continue to effectively run and operate our businesses with a focus on our customers and clients and on delivering long-term value for you, our shareholders. Second, to support and guide the proposed transaction through the regulatory process as Anthem leads that process and we support it. And third, to keep the company well positioned with optionality in a variety of scenarios given the uncertainty around the regulatory approval process. 
We are delivering on our strategy. We have maintained focus and continue to grow and invest in our businesses while delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients. And until this quarter, deliver on our shareholder commitments. While our results underperformed expectations in the second quarter, to be clear, our diversified businesses remain grounded in solid fundamentals, and we continue to innovate and deliver a notable array of capabilities that are truly differentiated. Our relationships with employers, providers and partners continue to strengthen. We continue to add new customer relationships in addition to maintaining high retention levels for existing customers and clients. We are maintaining a strong pipeline for future growth in all of our businesses, and we continue to generate and warehouse historical levels of deployable capital and balance sheet capability. 
While this is our immediate backdrop, it is important to remember our long-term strategic goal of 10% to 13% compounded annual growth on average for earnings per share. And over the last 6 years, we have delivered 13%, which is at the high end of that range. 
I'll now turn to our results in the second quarter. Our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business delivered strong 2016 second quarter financial results for our portfolio, which were tempered by disappointing performance in our group disability and life segment. Our second quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $10 billion over the second quarter of 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the second quarter of $515 million or $1.98 per share. Our revenue growth is fully aligned with our expectations, however, the earnings were pressured by temporary impacts on our group disability and life segment. 
Given that as a backdrop, let's discuss our group operations, specifically performance, issues and actions. The quarterly results were significantly below our expectations in both disability and life businesses. The poor performance in disability is a result of modifications made to the disability claim process coming into the first quarter of this year, where we are investing additional resources in the upfront medical review of claims to conduct further physical examinations, perform deeper medical history reviews and enhance documentation. 
These modifications has resulted in longer claim cycles, thereby increasing the disability durations and our claim inventory, which has contributed significantly to the unfavorable financial impact we have experienced in the first half of 2016 for this business. We are currently making the investments necessary to strengthen the operational processes in a manner that will provide an improved customer experience as we lower claim volatility and further improve the quality of decisions, all at a lower operating cost. 
While we've yet to realize the long-term benefits associated with these changes, it is important to recognize that they are both customer friendly and aligned with regulatory best practices. As a result, our disability operating results are expected to improve over the balance of 2016 and into 2017 as these changes take hold. And Cigna's differentiated disability model with a unique focus on productivity and health continues to deliver value for our customers and clients, as evidenced by our sustained growth and stable performance up to this point. 
Now to round out group insurance and to add to the disability pressure in the second quarter, our group disability and life earnings were significantly impacted by unfavorable life claims. While claims emerged unfavorably early in the quarter, claims in the last month of the quarter were more in line with our expectations. 
It is important to note for context we have had periods of life claim volatility in the past and expect life claims to run closer to historic levels over the balance of the year, due in part by the rapid reversion of the short-term spike in claims to historical levels and some reserve strengthening and pricing actions that we are taking. 
We understand the results in this business did not meet your expectations. And to be clear, they did not meet ours. We are taking actions to ensure they will improve and they present an earnings trajectory opportunity for us as we look to the future. 
Additionally, and importantly, our client and customer performance has been strong despite the financial impact of these challenges in the second quarter. Overall, our group disability and life business remains an important part of our portfolio. 
As for the rest of our portfolio, we continue to post strength in our Employer health care book and our Global Supplemental business. While our U.S. individual business has experienced softness similar to the rest of the industry, overall, our commercial book of business is performing well. Additionally, our U.S. Medicare book continues to perform in line with our expectations, recognizing we did incur increased temporary costs associated with our CMS audit issue. 
Now turning briefly to our pending combination. As you've recently seen, the United States Department of Justice has sued to block the proposed combination with Anthem. Given the nature of the concerns raised by the DOJ and the overall status of the regulatory process, which under the merger agreement is led by Anthem, we stepped back briefly to evaluate our options, consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement. 
As part of this evaluation, we obviously sought to deeply understand the various and significant concerns of the DOJ and the states that have joined on as well as the path to possibly address their broad and specific concerns. But to be clear, we have and will continue to fulfill our contractual obligations. If there is a successful combination to be completed, it is clearly our intent and commitment to continue to provide the support, as we have, dedicating significant resources, time and effort to do so. If there is not a combination to be completed, we will seek to improve shareholder value by accelerating growth in our core strong performing businesses, improve the results of our underperforming businesses, seek to pursue additional growth opportunities, and finally, seek to further create shareholder value with the tremendous capital flexibility we have created over the last several years. 
Reflecting on all these challenges and the criticality of the work we do, which impacts more than 90 million customer relationships around the world, I'd also like to take a moment to thank the Cigna team and recognize their steadfast passion, resilience and focus on our customers and clients during the past year. 
Now to summarize. Cigna's performance this quarter includes solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and a performance from our group disability and life segment that did not meet our expectations. We believe these results will improve meaningfully over the remaining 2016 and 2017 time frame. 
Our highly engaged, passionate and extremely resilient team will continue to create value for our customers and clients by levering the strength of our diversified businesses and our differentiated capabilities. We remain committed to our long-term objective to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while continuing to invest in our company's business portfolio. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5%",1133,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. 
Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10 billion, consolidated earnings of $515 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.98 and continued strong capital efficiency and free cash flow in line with our full year expectations. 
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Second quarter premiums and fees grew to $6.9 billion. Second quarter earnings were $486 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth and continued favorable medical cost and quality outcomes, particularly in our Commercial Employer Group business. These drivers were partially offset by higher medical costs in our individual business and increased costs related to our Medicare Advantage CMS audit response. 
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. On a currency-adjusted basis, premiums and fees grew 12% and earnings grew 15% quarter-over-quarter to $83 million. This was another strong quarter for our Global Supplemental Benefits business. 
Group disability and life reported a second quarter loss of $12 million. Results in the second quarter reflect the continued impact of modifications to our disability claims process and poor experience in group life claims. While second quarter results in our disability business were better than results in the first quarter, the improvement was less than we had expected. Results in the group life business were also below expectations. We experienced elevated claims early in the quarter, while life claims were more in line with the expectation later in the quarter. 
This quarter's results also included a $17 million after-tax unfavorable impact from a reserve study on our life business. And for comparative purposes, the second quarter of 2015 results included a $37 million after-tax favorable impact from a reserve study on our group disability business, resulting in a $54 million after-tax unfavorable variance from reserve studies quarter-over-quarter. 
Over the balance of the year, we expect life claims experience to run closer to the historical levels, and we continue to expect disability results to improve, but at a slower pace than previously expected as the process modifications implemented in the first quarter take time to mature and long-term benefits begin to emerge. 
Overall, our second quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and continuing pressure in the group disability and life results.  We also continue to generate strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility. 
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016.  We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $1.23 per share at the midpoint from previous expectations and is driven by an approximate $0.30 per share reduction due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response and higher medical costs in our individual business and an approximate $0.90 per share reduction due to higher claim costs in our group disability and life business. 
To provide greater transparency within our outlook, we are introducing segment-level guidance for full year 2016. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care's earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2016 customer growth in the low single-digit percentage range. 
Turning to medical costs. Our 2016 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization, which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. 
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%. The MCR outlook reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business and some continued pressure in individual medical costs. 
For our total government book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85%, reflecting the continued benefits of our physician engagement model within our Seniors business. 
Regarding operating expenses. We expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which includes the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. 
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth on a currency-adjusted basis and earnings in the range of $255 million to $275 million. 
Regarding the group disability and life business, we now expect full year earnings in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $80 million. Group disability and life earnings are well below our previous expectations and reflect results to date and continuing pressure over the balance of the year. 
Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $175 million for 2016. 
So all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. 
I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS between the third and fourth quarter to be more evenly distributed than historical patterns. And I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior reserve development or any future capital deployment. 
Regarding free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes.  Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook are strong and remain in line with our expectations. 
Now to recap. The fundamentals of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses remain strong. We are also taking the appropriate steps to address the challenges we are facing in group disability and life. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised full year 2016 earnings outlook. 
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

And on the disability side, how much of it is because you put in this new systems process that you missed some of the claims expense from earlier periods? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what it is."

First, just to frame, our group insurance business has been a strong and consistent performer. We recognize we're having an out-of-pattern year. We understand that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're taking specific steps to improve that. Let me talk about disability first and then life, and I think I'll put all your questions into that context. From the disability standpoint, first, we made operating changes to our business processes. Very importantly, these are not systemic changes or changes in technology. These are business process changes starting at the first quarter of this year with the goal of improving our customer service, driving further efficiency and effectiveness over the long term, all while complying with emerging regulatory best practices. It's clear that the operational disruption is more significant and prolonged than we had planned for. Importantly, our customers continue to see good, strong service. However, as we noted, the financials have suffered. We're already seeing improvement in the patterns as we go through the second quarter. So we see the pattern improving and expect to continue to see that improve throughout 2016 and as we step into 2017. These are not catch-up for prior year claims. Don't think about it that way. Its operational process changes of meaningful magnitude, and we're already seeing improvements to the pattern. And we will see improvements throughout '16 and into '17. Relative to the life book, your basic hypothesis is right. We have a meaningful book that over time has performed very well. Unfortunately, from time to time, our life book of business has a temporary dislocation of spike. And the second quarter of this year was one of those years. Order of magnitude, operating lives in the quarter, about $45 million after tax. It's important to note that the claims did settle back, generally speaking, within historical patterns by the end of the second quarter. Additionally, as you'd expect, we conducted a variety of detailed analyses to see if there were any other unique causes to the pattern when we saw a spike, and we found none. Also as we noted, we completed a reserve study in the second quarter. That resulted in a reserve strengthening of about $17 million after tax. So when you think about life taken together from an operating standpoint and from the reserve standpoint, altogether, a little more than $60 million after tax. So net-net, clearly not happy with the results. We clearly believe they're temporary. Life will recover more quickly for the reasons you stated, and disability will continue to recover throughout the remaining portion of 2016 and into 2017. As to the latter part of your question, you can think about the current year change in the outlook as split roughly 50-50 between the two lines of business."

To your point, we fully recognize the tremendous both capital, as in free cash flow, as well as capital through balance sheet leverage flexibility we've built over the last several years. In the event, taking your statement, that the DOJ process is not successful, our view is that as we look toward the second half and the latter part of 2017, we'd have $5 billion, a bit more than $5 billion of deployable cash, plus a balance sheet in the current situation that sits at about 27% leverage. Our view is that normal course of business, we could add 10 points to that leverage. For strategic M&A, you could add 15 points to that leverage. So taken together, a truly tremendous value-creation opportunity for shareholders in the event the DOJ process is not successful.

It transpires. Ideally, we like that not to happen because we want consistent, predictable environment. So to add to your point, as we noted, that spike took place in the early portion of the second quarter. And as I noted in my prepared remarks and my comments, we saw a reversion of the life pattern within historical ranges toward the latter part of the quarter. Secondly, we did significant analysis to try to determine whether or not there were any unique drivers of that, as you'd expect, and we didn't find any. And thirdly, there was a reserve study, which, while it triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening, a way of looking at it otherwise it only triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening. Specific to disability, you're right. We flagged this last quarter. They are operating changes that we put in place, as we noted. The results stepped down meaningfully in the first quarter. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've already seen progress in the second quarter relative to the improvement, albeit at a slower pace than we would like or projected. And we expect to continue to see that progress going forward. And that offsets, ultimately, the longer claim durations and the incurrence rates that we're incurring currently as well as the elevated claim inventory. So important to note, we are seeing improvement in the disability results through the second quarter and expect that pattern to continue throughout the remaining portion of this year and into 2017."

But as you recall, we've continued to take a very focused and disciplined view of the marketplace, primarily because we viewed from day 1 that 2014, '15 and '16, would be as we called it version 1.0 of the marketplace, underscored by a smaller aggregate size than was initially projected. We call it a little bit of a choppy operating environment for the new marketplace as well as we projected for the industry to have more losses than not. And in hindsight, that's demonstrating itself. So I'll ask Tom to describe a little bit about the financial impact for us."

Ralph, so we carry the flexibility -- you asked a broader question on capital deployment, you asked relative to share repurchase. Let me take the other dimension of it. Under the merger agreement, we have the ability to be active from an M&A standpoint. There are mutual limits going in both directions. The mutual limits point toward, in aggregate, over the life of the contract, $600 million and a transaction cap of $200 million. So transactions up to $200 million and cumulative transactions up to $600 million. That's mutual going in both directions. Relative to share repurchase, there are also limits in both directions. Specific to us, we have about $725 million of capacity left under the contractual obligations. At this point in time, again, with the transaction pending, we view it as less likely that there would be significant share repurchase over the immediate-term horizon, but we do have the capacity to do so under the merger agreement. And as I noted, approximately $725 million of remaining capacity."

But you can -- based on that spend, you can expect a sizable amount. Some of that probably does end up back in the run rate as we -- at least in the near term, as we institute more robust processes.

So those new offerings are aided or driven by very focused and aligned collaborative delivery system models. And those are performing better. As it relates to 2017, you're right. First and foremost, at this point, we planned for and expect to continue to participate. We've taken posture to position ourselves in a limited number of new markets where we have the ability to put in place those aligned collaborative delivery system models. But also, relative to the disruption we're seeing from a results standpoint, we continue to have active engagement and dialogue with both CMS and state agencies to ensure that we're mutually enabled to be focused on those areas and programs where we could address the sustained value, which really are pivoting off those collaborative delivery system models.

So that's, let's call it, $0.24. And then disability, you said $0.60 for the year. So if it's going to be improving through the year, it's at least $0.21 for this quarter? And then CMS you described as about a $0.12 problem. So all told, a little over $0.60 in pressure this quarter. Yet you only missed consensus is by about $0.40. Was there some business that outperformed in the quarter? Or did we just have the seasonal pattern wrong and so we missed your expectations by a much bigger amount? And I'm not even counting the individual business, which would have also impacted the quarter."

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. 
In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.10 per share for merger-related transaction costs. And we reported this charge as a special item. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of second quarter 2016 results. 
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It's been over a year since we've held a formal earnings call due to our pending combination, and, clearly, much has happened.

It's been over a year since we've held a formal earnings call due to our pending combination, and, clearly, much has happened. We wanted to take the opportunity to connect directly with you first, to reaffirm our goals and how we are delivering on our strategy; second, to provide an update around this quarter's results and the actions we are taking to remedy the specific performance headwind that has caused us to miss our expectations; and third, to provide some perspective regarding the actions from the U.S. Department of Justice to block our proposed combination with Anthem. 
After I share my remarks, Tom will briefly highlight our second quarter financial results and updated outlook in more detail, and we'll take your questions. After that, I'll leave you with a few closing thoughts following the Q&A portion of the call. 
I'd like to begin by underscoring that over the past year, our goals have been clear. First and foremost, to continue to effectively run and operate our businesses with a focus on our customers and clients and on delivering long-term value for you, our shareholders. Second, to support and guide the proposed transaction through the regulatory process as Anthem leads that process and we support it. And third, to keep the company well positioned with optionality in a variety of scenarios given the uncertainty around the regulatory approval process. 
We are delivering on our strategy. We have maintained focus and continue to grow and invest in our businesses while delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients. And until this quarter, deliver on our shareholder commitments. While our results underperformed expectations in the second quarter, to be clear, our diversified businesses remain grounded in solid fundamentals, and we continue to innovate and deliver a notable array of capabilities that are truly differentiated. Our relationships with employers, providers and partners continue to strengthen. We continue to add new customer relationships in addition to maintaining high retention levels for existing customers and clients. We are maintaining a strong pipeline for future growth in all of our businesses, and we continue to generate and warehouse historical levels of deployable capital and balance sheet capability. 
While this is our immediate backdrop, it is important to remember our long-term strategic goal of 10% to 13% compounded annual growth on average for earnings per share. And over the last 6 years, we have delivered 13%, which is at the high end of that range. 
I'll now turn to our results in the second quarter. Our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business delivered strong 2016 second quarter financial results for our portfolio, which were tempered by disappointing performance in our group disability and life segment. Our second quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $10 billion over the second quarter of 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the second quarter of $515 million or $1.98 per share. Our revenue growth is fully aligned with our expectations, however, the earnings were pressured by temporary impacts on our group disability and life segment. 
Given that as a backdrop, let's discuss our group operations, specifically performance, issues and actions. The quarterly results were significantly below our expectations in both disability and life businesses. The poor performance in disability is a result of modifications made to the disability claim process coming into the first quarter of this year, where we are investing additional resources in the upfront medical review of claims to conduct further physical examinations, perform deeper medical history reviews and enhance documentation. 
These modifications has resulted in longer claim cycles, thereby increasing the disability durations and our claim inventory, which has contributed significantly to the unfavorable financial impact we have experienced in the first half of 2016 for this business. We are currently making the investments necessary to strengthen the operational processes in a manner that will provide an improved customer experience as we lower claim volatility and further improve the quality of decisions, all at a lower operating cost. 
While we've yet to realize the long-term benefits associated with these changes, it is important to recognize that they are both customer friendly and aligned with regulatory best practices. As a result, our disability operating results are expected to improve over the balance of 2016 and into 2017 as these changes take hold. And Cigna's differentiated disability model with a unique focus on productivity and health continues to deliver value for our customers and clients, as evidenced by our sustained growth and stable performance up to this point. 
Now to round out group insurance and to add to the disability pressure in the second quarter, our group disability and life earnings were significantly impacted by unfavorable life claims. While claims emerged unfavorably early in the quarter, claims in the last month of the quarter were more in line with our expectations. 
It is important to note for context we have had periods of life claim volatility in the past and expect life claims to run closer to historic levels over the balance of the year, due in part by the rapid reversion of the short-term spike in claims to historical levels and some reserve strengthening and pricing actions that we are taking. 
We understand the results in this business did not meet your expectations. And to be clear, they did not meet ours. We are taking actions to ensure they will improve and they present an earnings trajectory opportunity for us as we look to the future. 
Additionally, and importantly, our client and customer performance has been strong despite the financial impact of these challenges in the second quarter. Overall, our group disability and life business remains an important part of our portfolio. 
As for the rest of our portfolio, we continue to post strength in our Employer health care book and our Global Supplemental business. While our U.S. individual business has experienced softness similar to the rest of the industry, overall, our commercial book of business is performing well. Additionally, our U.S. Medicare book continues to perform in line with our expectations, recognizing we did incur increased temporary costs associated with our CMS audit issue. 
Now turning briefly to our pending combination. As you've recently seen, the United States Department of Justice has sued to block the proposed combination with Anthem. Given the nature of the concerns raised by the DOJ and the overall status of the regulatory process, which under the merger agreement is led by Anthem, we stepped back briefly to evaluate our options, consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement. 
As part of this evaluation, we obviously sought to deeply understand the various and significant concerns of the DOJ and the states that have joined on as well as the path to possibly address their broad and specific concerns. But to be clear, we have and will continue to fulfill our contractual obligations. If there is a successful combination to be completed, it is clearly our intent and commitment to continue to provide the support, as we have, dedicating significant resources, time and effort to do so. If there is not a combination to be completed, we will seek to improve shareholder value by accelerating growth in our core strong performing businesses, improve the results of our underperforming businesses, seek to pursue additional growth opportunities, and finally, seek to further create shareholder value with the tremendous capital flexibility we have created over the last several years. 
Reflecting on all these challenges and the criticality of the work we do, which impacts more than 90 million customer relationships around the world, I'd also like to take a moment to thank the Cigna team and recognize their steadfast passion, resilience and focus on our customers and clients during the past year. 
Now to summarize. Cigna's performance this quarter includes solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and a performance from our group disability and life segment that did not meet our expectations. We believe these results will improve meaningfully over the remaining 2016 and 2017 time frame. 
Our highly engaged, passionate and extremely resilient team will continue to create value for our customers and clients by levering the strength of our diversified businesses and our differentiated capabilities. We remain committed to our long-term objective to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while continuing to invest in our company's business portfolio. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5%",1133,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. 
Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10 billion, consolidated earnings of $515 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.98 and continued strong capital efficiency and free cash flow in line with our full year expectations. 
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Second quarter premiums and fees grew to $6.9 billion. Second quarter earnings were $486 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth and continued favorable medical cost and quality outcomes, particularly in our Commercial Employer Group business. These drivers were partially offset by higher medical costs in our individual business and increased costs related to our Medicare Advantage CMS audit response. 
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. On a currency-adjusted basis, premiums and fees grew 12% and earnings grew 15% quarter-over-quarter to $83 million. This was another strong quarter for our Global Supplemental Benefits business. 
Group disability and life reported a second quarter loss of $12 million. Results in the second quarter reflect the continued impact of modifications to our disability claims process and poor experience in group life claims. While second quarter results in our disability business were better than results in the first quarter, the improvement was less than we had expected. Results in the group life business were also below expectations. We experienced elevated claims early in the quarter, while life claims were more in line with the expectation later in the quarter. 
This quarter's results also included a $17 million after-tax unfavorable impact from a reserve study on our life business. And for comparative purposes, the second quarter of 2015 results included a $37 million after-tax favorable impact from a reserve study on our group disability business, resulting in a $54 million after-tax unfavorable variance from reserve studies quarter-over-quarter. 
Over the balance of the year, we expect life claims experience to run closer to the historical levels, and we continue to expect disability results to improve, but at a slower pace than previously expected as the process modifications implemented in the first quarter take time to mature and long-term benefits begin to emerge. 
Overall, our second quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and continuing pressure in the group disability and life results.  We also continue to generate strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility. 
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016.  We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $1.23 per share at the midpoint from previous expectations and is driven by an approximate $0.30 per share reduction due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response and higher medical costs in our individual business and an approximate $0.90 per share reduction due to higher claim costs in our group disability and life business. 
To provide greater transparency within our outlook, we are introducing segment-level guidance for full year 2016. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care's earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2016 customer growth in the low single-digit percentage range. 
Turning to medical costs. Our 2016 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization, which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. 
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%. The MCR outlook reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business and some continued pressure in individual medical costs. 
For our total government book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85%, reflecting the continued benefits of our physician engagement model within our Seniors business. 
Regarding operating expenses. We expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which includes the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. 
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth on a currency-adjusted basis and earnings in the range of $255 million to $275 million. 
Regarding the group disability and life business, we now expect full year earnings in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $80 million. Group disability and life earnings are well below our previous expectations and reflect results to date and continuing pressure over the balance of the year. 
Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $175 million for 2016. 
So all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. 
I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS between the third and fourth quarter to be more evenly distributed than historical patterns. And I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior reserve development or any future capital deployment. 
Regarding free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes.  Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook are strong and remain in line with our expectations. 
Now to recap. The fundamentals of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses remain strong. We are also taking the appropriate steps to address the challenges we are facing in group disability and life. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised full year 2016 earnings outlook. 
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

First, just to frame, our group insurance business has been a strong and consistent performer. We recognize we're having an out-of-pattern year. We understand that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're taking specific steps to improve that. Let me talk about disability first and then life, and I think I'll put all your questions into that context. From the disability standpoint, first, we made operating changes to our business processes. Very importantly, these are not systemic changes or changes in technology. These are business process changes starting at the first quarter of this year with the goal of improving our customer service, driving further efficiency and effectiveness over the long term, all while complying with emerging regulatory best practices. It's clear that the operational disruption is more significant and prolonged than we had planned for. Importantly, our customers continue to see good, strong service. However, as we noted, the financials have suffered. We're already seeing improvement in the patterns as we go through the second quarter. So we see the pattern improving and expect to continue to see that improve throughout 2016 and as we step into 2017. These are not catch-up for prior year claims. Don't think about it that way. Its operational process changes of meaningful magnitude, and we're already seeing improvements to the pattern. And we will see improvements throughout '16 and into '17. Relative to the life book, your basic hypothesis is right. We have a meaningful book that over time has performed very well. Unfortunately, from time to time, our life book of business has a temporary dislocation of spike. And the second quarter of this year was one of those years. Order of magnitude, operating lives in the quarter, about $45 million after tax. It's important to note that the claims did settle back, generally speaking, within historical patterns by the end of the second quarter. Additionally, as you'd expect, we conducted a variety of detailed analyses to see if there were any other unique causes to the pattern when we saw a spike, and we found none. Also as we noted, we completed a reserve study in the second quarter. That resulted in a reserve strengthening of about $17 million after tax. So when you think about life taken together from an operating standpoint and from the reserve standpoint, altogether, a little more than $60 million after tax. So net-net, clearly not happy with the results. We clearly believe they're temporary. Life will recover more quickly for the reasons you stated, and disability will continue to recover throughout the remaining portion of 2016 and into 2017. As to the latter part of your question, you can think about the current year change in the outlook as split roughly 50-50 between the two lines of business."

To your point, we fully recognize the tremendous both capital, as in free cash flow, as well as capital through balance sheet leverage flexibility we've built over the last several years. In the event, taking your statement, that the DOJ process is not successful, our view is that as we look toward the second half and the latter part of 2017, we'd have $5 billion, a bit more than $5 billion of deployable cash, plus a balance sheet in the current situation that sits at about 27% leverage. Our view is that normal course of business, we could add 10 points to that leverage. For strategic M&A, you could add 15 points to that leverage. So taken together, a truly tremendous value-creation opportunity for shareholders in the event the DOJ process is not successful.

If you look at the life industry, players in the life industry unfortunately, it's the nature of the book of business, will experience short-term temporary spikes or dislocations in costs. It transpires. Ideally, we like that not to happen because we want consistent, predictable environment. So to add to your point, as we noted, that spike took place in the early portion of the second quarter. And as I noted in my prepared remarks and my comments, we saw a reversion of the life pattern within historical ranges toward the latter part of the quarter. Secondly, we did significant analysis to try to determine whether or not there were any unique drivers of that, as you'd expect, and we didn't find any. And thirdly, there was a reserve study, which, while it triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening, a way of looking at it otherwise it only triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening. Specific to disability, you're right. We flagged this last quarter. They are operating changes that we put in place, as we noted. The results stepped down meaningfully in the first quarter. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've already seen progress in the second quarter relative to the improvement, albeit at a slower pace than we would like or projected. And we expect to continue to see that progress going forward. And that offsets, ultimately, the longer claim durations and the incurrence rates that we're incurring currently as well as the elevated claim inventory. So important to note, we are seeing improvement in the disability results through the second quarter and expect that pattern to continue throughout the remaining portion of this year and into 2017."

First and foremost, relative to the -- our MA book of business, the fundamentals of the MA book of business continued to perform well. Very important. And we're pleased with the performance, both the service performance as well as the overall earnings performance of the book. You're correct. Our cost of remediation has grown. We are seeking to ensure that the remediation is both completed as rapidly as possible but also as comprehensively as possible. And as unfortunately is the case when you are doing a variety of complex bodies of work, sometimes, they're more complicated. Our #1 priority, though, is to get this issue fully remediated and create the sustainable platform for the growth and the ongoing performance we expect for many years to come. So ultimately, what's transpired is more complexity to the work necessary to build the sustainability that we want for the growth profile we see over the long term. But the operations and the day-to-day fundamentals of the earnings performance of the base book of business continues to be strong. As it relates to the individual book of business, I'll ask Tom to talk about the financials. But as you recall, we've continued to take a very focused and disciplined view of the marketplace, primarily because we viewed from day 1 that 2014, '15 and '16, would be as we called it version 1.0 of the marketplace, underscored by a smaller aggregate size than was initially projected. We call it a little bit of a choppy operating environment for the new marketplace as well as we projected for the industry to have more losses than not. And in hindsight, that's demonstrating itself. So I'll ask Tom to describe a little bit about the financial impact for us."

Like all of our businesses, they all come under a variety of regulatory forces. Relative to the disability space specifically, emerging best practices are pointing toward more, while we always have had upfront medical resources, for example, emerging best practices are pointing toward more upfront resources, more use of specialists, more comprehensive physical examinations upfront for a broader variety of scenarios. And those are illustrative of the types of changes we are putting in place as we see where the regulatory direction is going. And we want to ensure that we continue to position this book of business as an industry leader as it relates to the disability management process and the disability productivity management process.

Ralph, so we carry the flexibility -- you asked a broader question on capital deployment, you asked relative to share repurchase. Let me take the other dimension of it. Under the merger agreement, we have the ability to be active from an M&A standpoint. There are mutual limits going in both directions. The mutual limits point toward, in aggregate, over the life of the contract, $600 million and a transaction cap of $200 million. So transactions up to $200 million and cumulative transactions up to $600 million. That's mutual going in both directions. Relative to share repurchase, there are also limits in both directions. Specific to us, we have about $725 million of capacity left under the contractual obligations. At this point in time, again, with the transaction pending, we view it as less likely that there would be significant share repurchase over the immediate-term horizon, but we do have the capacity to do so under the merger agreement. And as I noted, approximately $725 million of remaining capacity."

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. 
In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.10 per share for merger-related transaction costs. And we reported this charge as a special item. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of second quarter 2016 results. 
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

Second, to support and guide the proposed transaction through the regulatory process as Anthem leads that process and we support it. And third, to keep the company well positioned with optionality in a variety of scenarios given the uncertainty around the regulatory approval process. 
We are delivering on our strategy. We have maintained focus and continue to grow and invest in our businesses while delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients. And until this quarter, deliver on our shareholder commitments. While our results underperformed expectations in the second quarter, to be clear, our diversified businesses remain grounded in solid fundamentals, and we continue to innovate and deliver a notable array of capabilities that are truly differentiated. Our relationships with employers, providers and partners continue to strengthen. We continue to add new customer relationships in addition to maintaining high retention levels for existing customers and clients. We are maintaining a strong pipeline for future growth in all of our businesses, and we continue to generate and warehouse historical levels of deployable capital and balance sheet capability. 
While this is our immediate backdrop, it is important to remember our long-term strategic goal of 10% to 13% compounded annual growth on average for earnings per share. And over the last 6 years, we have delivered 13%, which is at the high end of that range. 
I'll now turn to our results in the second quarter. Our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business delivered strong 2016 second quarter financial results for our portfolio, which were tempered by disappointing performance in our group disability and life segment. Our second quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $10 billion over the second quarter of 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the second quarter of $515 million or $1.98 per share. Our revenue growth is fully aligned with our expectations, however, the earnings were pressured by temporary impacts on our group disability and life segment. 
Given that as a backdrop, let's discuss our group operations, specifically performance, issues and actions. The quarterly results were significantly below our expectations in both disability and life businesses. The poor performance in disability is a result of modifications made to the disability claim process coming into the first quarter of this year, where we are investing additional resources in the upfront medical review of claims to conduct further physical examinations, perform deeper medical history reviews and enhance documentation. 
These modifications has resulted in longer claim cycles, thereby increasing the disability durations and our claim inventory, which has contributed significantly to the unfavorable financial impact we have experienced in the first half of 2016 for this business. We are currently making the investments necessary to strengthen the operational processes in a manner that will provide an improved customer experience as we lower claim volatility and further improve the quality of decisions, all at a lower operating cost. 
While we've yet to realize the long-term benefits associated with these changes, it is important to recognize that they are both customer friendly and aligned with regulatory best practices. As a result, our disability operating results are expected to improve over the balance of 2016 and into 2017 as these changes take hold. And Cigna's differentiated disability model with a unique focus on productivity and health continues to deliver value for our customers and clients, as evidenced by our sustained growth and stable performance up to this point. 
Now to round out group insurance and to add to the disability pressure in the second quarter, our group disability and life earnings were significantly impacted by unfavorable life claims. While claims emerged unfavorably early in the quarter, claims in the last month of the quarter were more in line with our expectations. 
It is important to note for context we have had periods of life claim volatility in the past and expect life claims to run closer to historic levels over the balance of the year, due in part by the rapid reversion of the short-term spike in claims to historical levels and some reserve strengthening and pricing actions that we are taking. 
We understand the results in this business did not meet your expectations. And to be clear, they did not meet ours. We are taking actions to ensure they will improve and they present an earnings trajectory opportunity for us as we look to the future. 
Additionally, and importantly, our client and customer performance has been strong despite the financial impact of these challenges in the second quarter. Overall, our group disability and life business remains an important part of our portfolio. 
As for the rest of our portfolio, we continue to post strength in our Employer health care book and our Global Supplemental business. While our U.S. individual business has experienced softness similar to the rest of the industry, overall, our commercial book of business is performing well. Additionally, our U.S. Medicare book continues to perform in line with our expectations, recognizing we did incur increased temporary costs associated with our CMS audit issue. 
Now turning briefly to our pending combination. As you've recently seen, the United States Department of Justice has sued to block the proposed combination with Anthem. Given the nature of the concerns raised by the DOJ and the overall status of the regulatory process, which under the merger agreement is led by Anthem, we stepped back briefly to evaluate our options, consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement. 
As part of this evaluation, we obviously sought to deeply understand the various and significant concerns of the DOJ and the states that have joined on as well as the path to possibly address their broad and specific concerns. But to be clear, we have and will continue to fulfill our contractual obligations. If there is a successful combination to be completed, it is clearly our intent and commitment to continue to provide the support, as we have, dedicating significant resources, time and effort to do so. If there is not a combination to be completed, we will seek to improve shareholder value by accelerating growth in our core strong performing businesses, improve the results of our underperforming businesses, seek to pursue additional growth opportunities, and finally, seek to further create shareholder value with the tremendous capital flexibility we have created over the last several years. 
Reflecting on all these challenges and the criticality of the work we do, which impacts more than 90 million customer relationships around the world, I'd also like to take a moment to thank the Cigna team and recognize their steadfast passion, resilience and focus on our customers and clients during the past year. 
Now to summarize. Cigna's performance this quarter includes solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and a performance from our group disability and life segment that did not meet our expectations. We believe these results will improve meaningfully over the remaining 2016 and 2017 time frame. 
Our highly engaged, passionate and extremely resilient team will continue to create value for our customers and clients by levering the strength of our diversified businesses and our differentiated capabilities. We remain committed to our long-term objective to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while continuing to invest in our company's business portfolio. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5%",1133,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. 
Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10 billion, consolidated earnings of $515 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.98 and continued strong capital efficiency and free cash flow in line with our full year expectations. 
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Second quarter premiums and fees grew to $6.9 billion. Second quarter earnings were $486 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth and continued favorable medical cost and quality outcomes, particularly in our Commercial Employer Group business. These drivers were partially offset by higher medical costs in our individual business and increased costs related to our Medicare Advantage CMS audit response. 
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. On a currency-adjusted basis, premiums and fees grew 12% and earnings grew 15% quarter-over-quarter to $83 million. This was another strong quarter for our Global Supplemental Benefits business. 
Group disability and life reported a second quarter loss of $12 million. Results in the second quarter reflect the continued impact of modifications to our disability claims process and poor experience in group life claims. While second quarter results in our disability business were better than results in the first quarter, the improvement was less than we had expected. Results in the group life business were also below expectations. We experienced elevated claims early in the quarter, while life claims were more in line with the expectation later in the quarter. 
This quarter's results also included a $17 million after-tax unfavorable impact from a reserve study on our life business. And for comparative purposes, the second quarter of 2015 results included a $37 million after-tax favorable impact from a reserve study on our group disability business, resulting in a $54 million after-tax unfavorable variance from reserve studies quarter-over-quarter. 
Over the balance of the year, we expect life claims experience to run closer to the historical levels, and we continue to expect disability results to improve, but at a slower pace than previously expected as the process modifications implemented in the first quarter take time to mature and long-term benefits begin to emerge. 
Overall, our second quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and continuing pressure in the group disability and life results.  We also continue to generate strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility. 
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016.  We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $1.23 per share at the midpoint from previous expectations and is driven by an approximate $0.30 per share reduction due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response and higher medical costs in our individual business and an approximate $0.90 per share reduction due to higher claim costs in our group disability and life business. 
To provide greater transparency within our outlook, we are introducing segment-level guidance for full year 2016. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care's earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2016 customer growth in the low single-digit percentage range. 
Turning to medical costs. Our 2016 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization, which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. 
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%. The MCR outlook reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business and some continued pressure in individual medical costs. 
For our total government book of business, we expect the 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85%, reflecting the continued benefits of our physician engagement model within our Seniors business. 
Regarding operating expenses. We expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which includes the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. 
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth on a currency-adjusted basis and earnings in the range of $255 million to $275 million. 
Regarding the group disability and life business, we now expect full year earnings in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $80 million. Group disability and life earnings are well below our previous expectations and reflect results to date and continuing pressure over the balance of the year. 
Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $175 million for 2016. 
So all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. 
I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS between the third and fourth quarter to be more evenly distributed than historical patterns. And I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior reserve development or any future capital deployment. 
Regarding free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes.  Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook are strong and remain in line with our expectations. 
Now to recap. The fundamentals of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses remain strong. We are also taking the appropriate steps to address the challenges we are facing in group disability and life. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised full year 2016 earnings outlook. 
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

First, just to frame, our group insurance business has been a strong and consistent performer. We recognize we're having an out-of-pattern year. We understand that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're taking specific steps to improve that. Let me talk about disability first and then life, and I think I'll put all your questions into that context. From the disability standpoint, first, we made operating changes to our business processes. Very importantly, these are not systemic changes or changes in technology. These are business process changes starting at the first quarter of this year with the goal of improving our customer service, driving further efficiency and effectiveness over the long term, all while complying with emerging regulatory best practices. It's clear that the operational disruption is more significant and prolonged than we had planned for. Importantly, our customers continue to see good, strong service. However, as we noted, the financials have suffered. We're already seeing improvement in the patterns as we go through the second quarter. So we see the pattern improving and expect to continue to see that improve throughout 2016 and as we step into 2017. These are not catch-up for prior year claims. Don't think about it that way. Its operational process changes of meaningful magnitude, and we're already seeing improvements to the pattern. And we will see improvements throughout '16 and into '17. Relative to the life book, your basic hypothesis is right. We have a meaningful book that over time has performed very well. Unfortunately, from time to time, our life book of business has a temporary dislocation of spike. And the second quarter of this year was one of those years. Order of magnitude, operating lives in the quarter, about $45 million after tax. It's important to note that the claims did settle back, generally speaking, within historical patterns by the end of the second quarter. Additionally, as you'd expect, we conducted a variety of detailed analyses to see if there were any other unique causes to the pattern when we saw a spike, and we found none. Also as we noted, we completed a reserve study in the second quarter. That resulted in a reserve strengthening of about $17 million after tax. So when you think about life taken together from an operating standpoint and from the reserve standpoint, altogether, a little more than $60 million after tax. So net-net, clearly not happy with the results. We clearly believe they're temporary. Life will recover more quickly for the reasons you stated, and disability will continue to recover throughout the remaining portion of 2016 and into 2017. As to the latter part of your question, you can think about the current year change in the outlook as split roughly 50-50 between the two lines of business."

To your point, we fully recognize the tremendous both capital, as in free cash flow, as well as capital through balance sheet leverage flexibility we've built over the last several years. In the event, taking your statement, that the DOJ process is not successful, our view is that as we look toward the second half and the latter part of 2017, we'd have $5 billion, a bit more than $5 billion of deployable cash, plus a balance sheet in the current situation that sits at about 27% leverage. Our view is that normal course of business, we could add 10 points to that leverage. For strategic M&A, you could add 15 points to that leverage. So taken together, a truly tremendous value-creation opportunity for shareholders in the event the DOJ process is not successful.

If you look at the life industry, players in the life industry unfortunately, it's the nature of the book of business, will experience short-term temporary spikes or dislocations in costs. It transpires. Ideally, we like that not to happen because we want consistent, predictable environment. So to add to your point, as we noted, that spike took place in the early portion of the second quarter. And as I noted in my prepared remarks and my comments, we saw a reversion of the life pattern within historical ranges toward the latter part of the quarter. Secondly, we did significant analysis to try to determine whether or not there were any unique drivers of that, as you'd expect, and we didn't find any. And thirdly, there was a reserve study, which, while it triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening, a way of looking at it otherwise it only triggered a $17 million after-tax strengthening. Specific to disability, you're right. We flagged this last quarter. They are operating changes that we put in place, as we noted. The results stepped down meaningfully in the first quarter.

And we expect to continue to see that progress going forward. And that offsets, ultimately, the longer claim durations and the incurrence rates that we're incurring currently as well as the elevated claim inventory. So important to note, we are seeing improvement in the disability results through the second quarter and expect that pattern to continue throughout the remaining portion of this year and into 2017."

First and foremost, relative to the -- our MA book of business, the fundamentals of the MA book of business continued to perform well. Very important. And we're pleased with the performance, both the service performance as well as the overall earnings performance of the book. You're correct. Our cost of remediation has grown. We are seeking to ensure that the remediation is both completed as rapidly as possible but also as comprehensively as possible. And as unfortunately is the case when you are doing a variety of complex bodies of work, sometimes, they're more complicated. Our #1 priority, though, is to get this issue fully remediated and create the sustainable platform for the growth and the ongoing performance we expect for many years to come. So ultimately, what's transpired is more complexity to the work necessary to build the sustainability that we want for the growth profile we see over the long term. But the operations and the day-to-day fundamentals of the earnings performance of the base book of business continues to be strong. As it relates to the individual book of business, I'll ask Tom to talk about the financials. But as you recall, we've continued to take a very focused and disciplined view of the marketplace, primarily because we viewed from day 1 that 2014, '15 and '16, would be as we called it version 1.0 of the marketplace, underscored by a smaller aggregate size than was initially projected. We call it a little bit of a choppy operating environment for the new marketplace as well as we projected for the industry to have more losses than not. And in hindsight, that's demonstrating itself. So I'll ask Tom to describe a little bit about the financial impact for us."

Ralph, so we carry the flexibility -- you asked a broader question on capital deployment, you asked relative to share repurchase. Let me take the other dimension of it. Under the merger agreement, we have the ability to be active from an M&A standpoint. There are mutual limits going in both directions. The mutual limits point toward, in aggregate, over the life of the contract, $600 million and a transaction cap of $200 million. So transactions up to $200 million and cumulative transactions up to $600 million. That's mutual going in both directions. Relative to share repurchase, there are also limits in both directions. Specific to us, we have about $725 million of capacity left under the contractual obligations. At this point in time, again, with the transaction pending, we view it as less likely that there would be significant share repurchase over the immediate-term horizon, but we do have the capacity to do so under the merger agreement. And as I noted, approximately $725 million of remaining capacity."

We have focused on bringing innovative, transparent both engagement and incentive-based models. And over time, our results here have been tremendous, not just from a growth standpoint or earnings standpoint, but from the value we deliver back to those employers and employees by having those aligned models. As for results, we've yet grown again this year. Our customer base and the pattern, at least on a year-to-date basis, is similar to last year's pattern. And to your core of your question, we continue to see this as an attractive growth market as employers in that space continue to look more aggressively toward alternatives that again are transparent and aligned.

In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures shareholders is come in contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded 2 charges to shareholders' net income, which we recorded as special items. 
The first special item was an after-tax charge of $46 million or $0.18 per share for merger-related transaction costs. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $25 million or $0.10 per share related to a litigation matter. 
As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of third quarter 2016 results. 
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on the basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

In my remarks today, I'll begin with a review of highlights from the third quarter. I'll also discuss our ability to anticipate and meet customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs, continue to drive our business performance. And then I'll discuss how well position businesses continue to deliver strong results for benefit of our shareholders and how we're driving improvements for our businesses that are currently underperforming their potential. We were doing all of this while we continue to prepare for the future by investing in capabilities that meet customers' needs and while we continue to support the litigation process with our proposed Anthem combination. 
Next, I'll provide more detail around our third quarter financial performance and our full outlook and following your questions, I'll conclude our conversation with just a few concluding remarks. 
Let's begin with some highlights from the quarter. Our third quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion over the third quarter 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of $503 million or $1.94 per share, reflecting strong performance in our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and improving results in our Group Disability and Life segment. Our actions continue to be guided by our proven strategy of Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual, with a focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers and clients through ongoing innovation and a commitment to being a trusted partner as well as continuing investments for future growth in capabilities which deliver affordable, personalized solutions and further expanded geographic reach. 
Around the world, individuals are seeking access to quality health care and Social Security programs that are both of high-quality and affordable. 
At the same time, employers of all sizes and across all industries and geographies increasingly recognize that healthier, more engaged and productive workforces are essential to driving their businesses forward while they continue to seek solutions that are affordable and sustainable. 
Amidst this backdrop, many individuals and employers are concerned that they must accept either constrained access or diminished quality or both in order to achieve affordability of care. At Cigna, we see it differently. We have demonstrated the quality and affordability can be achieved by designing personally tailored access and high-quality care delivery with engagement, alignment and support for individuals and health care professionals. We delivered this through personalized and localized benefits as well as services for customers, which empower and support their actions and decision making and enable them to find the right balance of access, quality and affordability. 
At the same time, we support health care professionals with actionable insights and further expanded care resources, all while ensuring alignment with them to deliver superior quality and approved affordability. 
To further innovate for our customers and clients, we're accelerating investments in value-based care programs and incentive payment models with our provider partners that continue to drive enhancements in both care quality and affordability. 
For example, today, we have 160 collaborative accountable care arrangements which spans 29 states and we serve well over 2 million customers in these value-based programs. 
Our success in driving increased affordability is reflected in our continued delivery of industry-leading medical cost trend. 
In support of that, 82% of our more mature collaborative relationships with large physician groups had outperformed the market in total medical costs. This leadership and physician partnership was also most recently validated through Cigna's first place ranking amongst 214 companies in Athena Health provider satisfaction survey. All those who anticipate identified and helped satisfy these needs continues to resonate with our customers and clients as well as our provider partners. 
Importantly, across all of our businesses, our customer and client experience remains a high levels. As a result, we tend to remain strong, and this presents opportunities for further expansion of our customer-client relationships. 
Importantly, these long-term relationships allow us to support individuals more meaningfully across their life and health stages. 
Now relative to our businesses we have an opportunity to improve performance. Throughout the third quarter, we made solid progress in our efforts to improve the financial results of our Group Disability and Life segment. As the model begins to mature, this will lead to a further differentiated customer experience. 
While at Cigna HealthSpring, we continue to make progress in the CMS auto remediation work. Our focus remains on completing this work and growing our business with industry-leading collaborative relationships all to drive positive outcomes for the benefit of seniors. We expect to emerge from this work with a stronger, more sustainable model that ensures seniors continue to receive the highest quality service experience and clinical outcomes. 
So to summarize, our well performing businesses continue to deliver strong results, and we are driving improvements where needed. This combined with ongoing investments for the future and our tremendous capital resources positions us with strength and flexibility to deliver sustained value for our customers and clients and differentiated results for our shareholders. 
Now as we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver attractive financial performance and growth. We see a number of earnings tailwinds, including: Continued strong performance of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, with high customer retention levels and solid revenue and earnings growth; second, more meaningful improvement in the margin for our disability and life business; and third, meaningful margin improvement for seniors business, with a ramp down of remediation cost will more than offset the headwinds caused by the revenue reductions that we expect for 2017 in this business. 
As always, there may be variability in 2017 in the rate and pace of both medical utilization as well as the pace of our strategic investments. 
When we take the tailwinds and headwinds as a whole, and consider our significant capital position and ongoing strong free cash flow generation, we are well positioned for an attractive 2017. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate some of the key points for my remarks this morning. Cigna is operating a well positioned diversified businesses, dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and delivering value through engagement incentive alignment and support services. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue our momentum in a well performing businesses and improve the results in some of our historical strong businesses. Our long-term objective remains commitment to our annual growth of 10% to 13% EPS on average, all while we continue to invest back in our company. And the high levels of ongoing free cash flow generated from our diverse business portfolio and tremendous capital resources available for deployment give us a strong degree of flexibility to pursue further value-creation options for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 bil",1083,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. 
Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion, consolidated earnings of $503 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.94 and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. This 
quarter's results reflect continued strong revenue earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and improved results in our Group Disability and Life business. 
Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $6.8 billion. Third quarter earnings were $416 million, reflecting continued strong performance in our commercial business, driven by customer growth, strong specialty results and favorable medical cost outcomes. Offsetting these strong commercial results were elevated cost in our Government business related to our CMS audit response and some less racial pressure primarily in our Medicaid offerings and Texas and Illinois. 
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. Premiums and fees grew 9% and earnings of $81 million represent growth of 31% quarter-over-quarter or 25% in the currency-adjusted basis, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense discipline. This business continues to achieve attractive growth and profitability as we deliver value to our customers with personalized and affordable offerings in the supplemental benefits space. 
The Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee growth up 4% over third quarter 2015. Third quarter earnings in our group business were $53 million, reflecting stabilize payment experience in our book of business and sequential improvement in disability results as the claim process modifications we made earlier this year continue to mature. 
Additionally, we completed our annual disability reserve review in the third quarter and consistent with our commentary last quarter, this review had di minimus impact on results. 
Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and an improvement in our Group Disability and Life results with some elevated cost in our Government business. 
We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility. 
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.87 billion. This reflects continued strong performance in our commercial health care business, offset by a reduction of $60 million from previous expectations in our Government business due to higher than previously anticipated cost associated with our CMS audit response as well as loss ratio pressure in our Medicaid business. 
The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the low single digit percentage range in 2016. 
Turning to medical costs, where our total U.S. Commercial business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%, a 50 basis point improvement over our previous expectations. We continue to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization. 
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business. 
Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of [indiscernible] plans in our employer group and individual businesses. 
For our total government book of business, we now expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, reflecting some pressure in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois. 
Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which continues to include the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. 
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and now, expect earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase over our previous outlook. 
Regarding the group's disability and life business, we now expect full year 2016 earnings in the range of $80 million to $110 million. This also represent an increase in our earnings expectations for the group. 
Regarding our remaining operations that is other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2016. 
So all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion or $7.80 to $8.05 per share.  I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment. 
Regarding free cash flow, year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company funds, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong. 
Now to recap. We continue to invest in capabilities and programs across our businesses, which will deliver significant growth opportunities into the future. Our third quarter 2016 results reflects strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses, marked by continued positive momentum in our employer business, Commercial Employer and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses as well as improvement in Group Disability and Life business. 
In our Government business, the increased investments that we're making with regard to our audit response ensure that we are well positioned for long-term growth. 
Overall, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2016 earnings outlook and are well positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2017. 
With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Let me give you just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers as we think about moving from '16 to '17. And I appreciate your reframing our long-term commitment of the 10% to 13% on average, which we delivered on average over the last half a dozen years. Specifically, we see 3. We call it the 3 largest meaningful tailwinds that are specific and compelling. Number one is the continued leverage of our well performing businesses specifically our U.S. employer health care business and our global individual business where we expect to continue to deliver attractive both revenue and earnings growth. Second is a meaningful step up in the margin performance for the Group Disability and Life business and third is margin expansion in the Government business, where largely the attrition of the cost profile that we've incurred this year which were significant will more than offset the revenue headwind. It's important to attach on top of that that's going to take place under 1 or 2 environments. We'll either be in a so-called Plan A, where we're able to effectuate the combination and stepping into a different environment or a so-called Plan B, where the government will stop and impede us in terms of the ability to combine. In a Plan B scenario, our estimates toward the latter part of 2017, we'll have between $7 billion and $14 billion of deployable capital, which is made up of about $5 billion of free cash at the latter part of 2017 leverage that we can get step up to one threshold if we're going to use it solely for internal purposes, dividend, buyback and the like and the higher end of the range is that we're going to use leverage largely to expand ourselves through M&A capacity. So taken as a whole, a significant uptick. I don't think it's constructive on this call to try to scroll the numbers around the underlying run rate.

Secondly, you know us quite well, and you know even with the revised outlook for Group Disability and Life business, the earnings dislocation there is significant. And if you'll just project forward a mindset that our view is a stable and consistent performance of the Life business, that is a meaningful step up then continued improvement in the Disability business, there's a significant step up or an example to your point of a onetime this location when you would compare 2016 to '17.

First, by way of context, so this is obviously, a complex undertaking, and as I noted it's $100 million re-enforces its complex in terms of what we're confronting here. We confronted an audit process that was changed and modernized for CMS so a new audit methodology. We operate a business model that functions off to more modern collaborative or value-based environment and what that means is we have a lot of partners. Think about entities that we work with and partnerships to get that value-based environment, think about that are part of a couple hundred. So the ability to operate in this more modernized audit environment relative to that, which we believe is a big part of what the future health care looks like, require us to drive some changes. We're driving those changes, and we'll seek to get those resolved in short order. So we think we're in the latter phase. That's point one. Two, we believe the large majority of those costs will not be re-occurring that otherwise will be contributors to 2017's earnings for the margin inflection. And third, we fully expect our retention levels to outperform the numbers that you referenced, largely based on the different orientation we have in our model, and we can look back and look at the retentive nature of our business over a long period of time and those relationships. So well, and we expect the revenue headwind that will be meaningful, our revenue headwind projection is not in line with the numbers you made reference to, and we think it's largely driven by the different model we have, whereby, once our customers are with us a year or more, they tend to be with us for a long, long time largely because of those collaborative relationships."

As we view the opening of this marketplace in 2014, it's probably being much smaller than projections, not profitable for the industry and choppy or less than stable operationally. And unfortunately, has proven more right than wrong. We entered 5 markets, and we deliberately and slowly grew to 7 markets. As we look to 2017, our initial plan had us growing intend markets. After assessing all the market dynamics, we're going to end up in 7 markets in 2017, but a different mix, where we will shrink our footprint in 3 markets by leaving 3 markets on the exchange. And then we'll have a new offering in 3 different markets, specifically built on our collaborative model. So some change in the overall profile of our marketplace, but a smaller geographic footprint and then we were anticipating -- we anticipated going from 7 to 10. We're actually going be in 7 with a different mix. Net-net taken at all is a whole for next year, we're going to expect to see some revenue growth there.

In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded 2 charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items.
The first special item was an after-tax charge of $46 million, or $0.18 per share for merger-related transaction costs. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $25 million, or $0.10 per share related to a litigation matter. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of third quarter 2016 results.
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on the basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

In my remarks today, I'll begin with a review of highlights from the third quarter. I'll also discuss how our ability to anticipate and meet customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs, continues to drive our business performance. And then I'll discuss how our well-positioned businesses continue to deliver strong results for the benefit of our shareholders, and how we're driving improvements for our businesses that are currently underperforming their potential. We are doing all of this, while we continue to prepare for the future by investing in capabilities that meet customers' needs, and while we continue to support the litigation process with our proposed Anthem combination.
Next, Tom, will provide more detail around our third quarter financial performance, and our full year outlook. And following your questions, I'll conclude our conversation with just a few concluding remarks.
Let's begin with some highlights from the quarter. Our third quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion over the third quarter 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of $503 million, or $1.94 per share, reflecting strong performance in our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and improving results in our Group Disability and Life segment. Our actions continue to be guided by our proven strategy of Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual. With a focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers and clients through ongoing innovation, and a commitment to being a trusted partner as well as continuing investments for future growth and capabilities which deliver affordable, personalized solutions and further expand our geographic reach.
Around the world, individuals are seeking access to quality health care in sense of security programs that are both of high quality and affordable. At the same time, employers of all sizes and across all industries and geographies increasingly recognize that healthier, more engaged and productive workforces are essential to driving their businesses forward, while they continue to seek solutions that are affordable and sustainable.
Amid this backdrop, many individuals and employers are concerned that they must accept either constrained access or diminished quality, or both in order to achieve affordability of care. At Cigna, we see it differently. We have demonstrated that quality and affordability can be achieved by designing personally tailored access and high-quality care delivery with engagement, alignment and support for individuals and health care professionals. We deliver this through personalized and localized benefits as well as services for our customers, which empower and support their actions and decision making and enable them to find the right balance of access, quality and affordability.
At the same time, we support health care professionals with actionable insights in further expanded care resources, all while ensuring alignment with them to deliver superior quality and approved affordability. To further innovate for our customers and clients, we're accelerating investments in value-based care programs and incentive payment models with our provider partners that continue to drive enhancements in both care quality and affordability.
For example, today, we have 160 collaborative accountable care arrangements which span 29 states, and we serve well over 2 million customers in these value-based programs. Our success in driving increased affordability is reflected in our continued delivery of industry-leading medical cost trend.
In support of that, 82% of our more mature collaborative relationships with large physician groups have outperformed the market in total medical cost. This leadership and physician partnership was also, most recently, validated through Cigna's first place ranking amongst 214 companies in athenahealth's provider satisfaction survey. Although, to anticipate, identify and help satisfy these needs continues to resonate with our customers and clients as well as our provider partners.
Importantly, across all of our businesses, our customer and client experience remains at high levels. As a result, we tend to remain strong, and this presents ongoing opportunities for further expansion of our customer and client relationships Importantly, these long-term relationships allow us to support individuals more meaningfully across their life and health stages.
Now relative to our businesses, we have an opportunity to improve performance. Throughout the third quarter, we made solid progress in our efforts to improve the financial results of our Group Disability and Life segment. As the model begins to mature, this will lead to a further differentiated customer experience.
Relative to Cigna-HealthSpring, we continue to make progress in the CMS audit remediation work. Our focus remains on completing this work and growing our business with industry-leading collaborative relationships, all to drive positive outcomes for the benefit of seniors. We expect to emerge from this work with a stronger, more sustainable model that ensures seniors will continue to receive the highest quality service experience and clinical outcomes.
So to summarize, our well-performing businesses continue to deliver strong results, and we are driving improvements where needed. This combined with our ongoing investments for the future, and our tremendous capital resources positions us with strength and flexibility to deliver sustained value for our customers and clients and differentiated results for our shareholders.
Now as we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver attractive financial performance and growth. We see a number of earnings tailwinds, including: Continued strong performance of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, with high customer retention levels and solid revenue and earnings growth; second, more meaningful improvement in the margin for our disability and life business; and third, meaningful margin improvement for our Seniors business, with a ramp down of remediation cost will more than offset the headwind caused by the revenue reductions that we expect for 2017 in this business.
As always, there may be variability in 2017 in the rate and pace of both medical utilization as well as the pace of our strategic investments. When we take the tailwinds and headwinds as a whole, and consider our significant capital position and ongoing strong free cash flow generation, we are well positioned for an attractive 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate some of the key points from my remarks this morning. Cigna is operating a well-positioned, diversified portfolio of businesses, dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and delivering value through engagement, incentive alignment and support services. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue our momentum in our well-performing businesses and improve the results in some of our historical strong businesses. Our long-term objective remains commitment to our annual growth of 10% to 13% EPS on average, all while we continue to invest back in our company. And the high levels of ongoing free cash flow generated from our diverse business portfolio and tremendous capital resources available for deployment give us a strong degree of flexibility to pursue further value-creation options for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 bill",1089,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.
Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion; consolidated earnings of $503 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.94; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. This quarter's result reflects continued strong revenue and earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and improved results in our Group Disability and Life business.
Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $6.8 billion. Third quarter earnings were $416 million, reflecting continued strong performance in our commercial business, driven by customer growth, strong specialty results and favorable medical cost outcomes. Offsetting these strong commercial results were elevated costs in our Government business related to our CMS audit response and some loss ratio pressure, primarily in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. Premiums and fees grew 9% and earnings of $81 million represent growth of 31% quarter-over-quarter or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense discipline. This business continues to achieve attractive growth and profitability, as we deliver value to our customers with personalized and affordable offerings in the supplemental benefits space.
For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee growth up 4% over third quarter 2015. Third quarter earnings in our group business were $53 million, reflecting stabilized payment experience in our life book of business and sequential improvement in disability results, as the claim process modifications we made earlier this year continue to mature.
Additionally, we completed our annual disability reserve review in the third quarter, and consistent with our commentary last quarter, this review had a di minimus impact on results.
Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and an improvement in our Group Disability and Life results with some elevated costs in our Government business. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.87 billion. This reflects continued strong performance in our commercial health care business, offset by a reduction of $60 million from previous expectations in our Government business, due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response as well as loss ratio pressure in our Medicaid business.
The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the low single-digit percentage range in 2016.
Turning to medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%, a 50 basis point improvement over our previous expectations. We continue to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients, as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization.
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business.
Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses.
For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, reflecting some pressure in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.
Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which continues to include the impact of spending on our CMS audit response.
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and, now, expect earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase over our previous outlook.
Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2016 earnings in the range of $80 million to $110 million. This also represents an increase in our earnings expectations for the group.
Regarding our remaining operations, that is, other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2016.
So all-in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment.
Regarding free cash flow, year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company funds, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong.
Now to recap. We continue to invest in capabilities and programs across our businesses, which will deliver significant growth opportunities into the future. Our third quarter 2016 results reflects strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses, marked by continued positive momentum in our employer business --  Commercial Employer and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses as well as improvement in our Group Disability and Life business.
In our Government business, the increased investments that we're making with regard to our audit response, ensure that we are well positioned for long-term growth.
Overall, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2016 earnings outlook and are well positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2017.
With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Our working assumption is that we will not be participating in the open enrollment period. Specific to the actions, I'm not going to delineate the specific actions you can and cannot take. There's clear rules in terms of what you can do, in terms of what the marketing versus retention activities. I think the most important thing to highlight is, within our model, you recall that our model is largely based where the majority of our lives are, in terms of very mature physician collaborative models. Hence, those customers or members have very deep relationships with those physician groups. That is a highly retentive tool, not perfect, but it's a highly retentive tool because there is a deep relationship that's been built, there is expanded services and the like. So while we expect attrition and as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're planning for a revenue headwind in 2017, that will be offset by the attrition of the remediation cost. We expect retention to perform better than the historical norms of a sanctioned environment. As it relates to '17, as soon as off sanctions, we'll be back in the monthly enrollment process, and we look forward to that environment."

Let me give you a -- just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers as we think about moving from '16 to '17.

Let me give you a -- just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers as we think about moving from '16 to '17. And I appreciate your reframing our long-term commitment of the 10% to 13% on average, which we've delivered on average over the last half a dozen years. Specifically, we see 3. We call it the 3 largest meaningful tailwinds that are specific and compelling. Number one, is the continued leverage of our well performing businesses, specifically, our U.S. employer health care business and our global individual business, where we expect to continue to deliver attractive, both, revenue and earnings growth. Second, is a meaningful step up in the margin performance for the Group Disability and Life business. And third is margin expansion in the Government business, where the --  largely the attrition of the cost profile that we've incurred this year, which was significant, will more than offset the revenue headwind. It's important to attach on top of that, that's going to take place under 1 or 2 environments. We'll either be in a, so-called, Plan A, where we're able to effectuate the combination where we're stepping into a different environment or a, so-called, Plan B, where the government will stop and impede us in terms of the ability to combine. In a Plan B scenario, our estimate is toward the latter part of 2017, we'll have between $7 billion and $14 billion of deployable capital, which is made up of about $5 billion of free cash at the latter part of 2017. Leverage, that we could step up to one threshold if we're going to use it solely for internal purposes, dividend, buyback and the like. And the higher end of the range is, that we're going to use leverage largely to expand ourselves through M&A capacity. So taken as a whole, a significant uptick. I don't think it's constructive on this call to try to scroll the numbers around the underlying run rate. Suffice to say, 2016 is a choppy year for us. 2017 will be quite attractive. And if we expect to deliver certain numbers on average since this year is not an average year from a transition, we'd expect to have a very strong performance for 2017."

So think about $100 million after tax, which is significant. Secondly, you know us quite well, and you know even with the revised outlook for our Group Disability and Life business, the earnings dislocation there is significant. And if you'll just project forward a mindset that our view is a stable and consistent performance of the life business, that's a meaningful step up. And then continued improvement in the disability business, there's a significant step up or an example to your point of a onetime dislocation when you would compare 2016 to '17.

First, by way of context, so this is a, obviously, a complex undertaking, and as I noted the $100 million reinforces its complex in terms of what we're confronting here. We confronted an audit process that was changed and modernized for CMS so a new audit methodology. We operate a business model that functions off the more modern collaborative or value-based environment and what that means is we have a lot of partners. Think about entities that we work with in partnership to get that value-based environment, and think about better part of a couple hundred. So the ability to operate in this more modernized audit environment relative to that, which we believe is a big part of what the future health care looks like, required us to drive some changes. We're driving those changes, and we'll seek to get those resolved in short order. So we think we're in the latter phase, is point one. Two, we believe the large majority of those costs will not be reoccurring that, otherwise, will be contributors to 2017's earnings or the margin inflection. And third, we fully expect our retention levels to outperform the numbers that you referenced, largely based on the different orientation we have in one of our model, and we could look back and look at the retentive nature of our business over a long period of time in those relationships. So while we expect a revenue headwind that will be meaningful, our revenue headwind projection is not in line with the numbers you made reference to, and we think it's largely driven by the different model we have. Whereby, once our customers are with us a year or more they tend to be with us for a long, long time, largely because of those collaborative relationships."

One, just to -- on the same topic, just a progression of the Global Health Care earnings through the year, I just want to make sure I understand. So if we look at the first quarter net income in the segment about $100 million, 2Q was down $42 million. Third quarter is down $66 million. The issues you've cited through the year have been individual market, Medicaid, the MA audit costs. But then as I look for the fourth quarter, it looks like you're looking for flat to plus 30 year-over-year. So just trying to understand that piece. Why does it improve on the 4Q on a trend basis?"

So point one is, throughout the course of the year, we have not seen a different pattern. Again, we have not seen a different pattern of the volume of claims that present themselves for consideration. So that's, I think, your first point. As we changed our model, we saw more claims go from that first bucket of potential claims to activated claims, open claims, because of the disruption of our process. So that's disruption point number one. Despite disruption point number two is, more claims stayed open or active for an elongated period of time because of the disruption. If I understand your question, if you think about the third quarter, we're seeing, again, no change in the number that are presenting themselves for consideration, but improvement in that bucket 2 and bucket 3, which are validated claims that are opened and the rate and pace in which claims are closed, and we expect, over time, that pattern to continue."

As I referenced before, long-term customer relationships are an important part of our model because it facilitates the interaction back and forth through the value-based offerings. Clearly, we saw to improve margins in some of the markets that we're underperforming, with a portfolio our size, there's always opportunities in some select markets to improve margins, but that that's a market-by-market approach. So think, guiding force, stable benefits, stable offerings, the customer first orientation working with our physician collaboratives, looking at all the tools that are available to us, especially, in the markets that maybe underperforming, some of those are the less mature markets.

In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded 2 charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items.
The first special item was an after-tax charge of $46 million, or $0.18 per share for merger-related transaction costs. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $25 million, or $0.10 per share related to a litigation matter. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of third quarter 2016 results.
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

In my remarks today, I'll begin with a review of highlights from the third quarter. I'll also discuss how our ability to anticipate and meet customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs, continues to drive our business performance. And then I'll discuss how our well-positioned businesses continue to deliver strong results for the benefit of our shareholders, and how we're driving improvements for our businesses that are currently underperforming their potential. We are doing all of this, while we continue to prepare for the future by investing in capabilities that meet customers' needs, and while we continue to support the litigation process with our proposed Anthem combination.
Next, Tom, will provide more detail around our third quarter financial performance, and our full year outlook. And following your questions, I'll conclude our conversation with just a few closing remarks.
Let's begin with some highlights from the quarter. Our third quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion over the third quarter 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of $503 million, or $1.94 per share, reflecting strong performance in our Commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and improving results in our Group Disability and Life segment. Our actions continue to be guided by our proven strategy of Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual. With a focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers and clients through ongoing innovation, and a commitment to being a trusted partner as well as continuing investments for future growth and capabilities which deliver affordable, personalized solutions and further expand our geographic reach.
Around the world, individuals are seeking access to quality health care and sense of security programs that are both of high quality and affordable. At the same time, employers of all sizes and across all industries and geographies increasingly recognize that healthier, more engaged and productive workforces are essential to driving their businesses forward, while they continue to seek solutions that are affordable and sustainable.
Amid this backdrop, many individuals and employers are concerned that they must accept either constrained access or diminished quality, or both in order to achieve affordability of care. At Cigna, we see it differently. We have demonstrated that quality and affordability can be achieved by designing personally tailored access and high-quality care delivery with engagement, alignment and support for individuals and health care professionals. We deliver this through personalized and localized benefits as well as services for our customers, which empower and support their actions and decision making and enable them to find the right balance of access, quality and affordability.
At the same time, we support health care professionals with actionable insights in further expanded care resources, all while ensuring alignment with them to deliver superior quality and improved affordability. To further innovate for our customers and clients, we're accelerating investments in value-based care programs and incentive payment models with our provider partners that continue to drive enhancements in both care quality and affordability.
For example, today, we have 160 collaborative accountable care arrangements which span 29 states, and we serve well over 2 million customers in these value-based programs. Our success in driving increased affordability is reflected in our continued delivery of industry-leading medical cost trend.
In support of that, 82% of our more mature collaborative relationships with large physician groups have outperformed the market in total medical cost. This leadership in physician partnership was also, most recently, validated through Cigna's first place ranking amongst 214 companies in athenahealth's provider satisfaction survey. Although, to anticipate, identify and help satisfy these needs continues to resonate with our customers and clients as well as our provider partners.
Importantly, across all of our businesses, our customer and client experience remains at high levels. As a result, we tend to remain strong, and this presents ongoing opportunities for further expansion of our customer and client relationships Importantly, these long-term relationships allow us to support individuals more meaningfully across their life and health stages.
Now relative to our businesses, we have an opportunity to improve performance. Throughout the third quarter, we made solid progress in our efforts to improve the financial results of our Group Disability and Life segment. As the model begins to mature, this will lead to a further differentiated customer experience.
Relative to Cigna-HealthSpring, we continue to make progress in the CMS audit remediation work. Our focus remains on completing this work and growing our business with industry-leading collaborative relationships, all to drive positive outcomes for the benefit of seniors. We expect to emerge from this work with a stronger, more sustainable model that ensures seniors will continue to receive the highest quality service experience and clinical outcomes.
So to summarize, our well-performing businesses continue to deliver strong results, and we are driving improvements where needed. This combined with our ongoing investments for the future, and our tremendous capital resources positions us with strength and flexibility to deliver sustained value for our customers and clients and differentiated results for our shareholders.
Now as we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver attractive financial performance and growth. We see a number of earnings tailwinds, including: Continued strong performance of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, with high customer retention levels and solid revenue and earnings growth; second, more meaningful improvement in the margin for our disability and life business; and third, meaningful margin improvement for our Seniors business, with a ramp down of remediation cost will more than offset the headwind caused by the revenue reductions that we expect for 2017 in this business.
As always, there may be variability in 2017 in the rate and pace of both medical utilization as well as the pace of our strategic investments. When we take the tailwinds and headwinds as a whole, and consider our significant capital position and ongoing strong free cash flow generation, we are well positioned for an attractive 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate some of the key points from my remarks this morning. Cigna is operating a well-positioned, diversified portfolio of businesses, dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and delivering value through engagement, incentive alignment and support services. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue our momentum in our well-performing businesses and improve the results in some of our historical strong businesses. Our long-term objective remains commitment to our annual growth of 10% to 13% EPS on average, all while we continue to invest back in our company. And the high levels of ongoing free cash flow generated from our diverse business portfolio and tremendous capital resources available for deployment give us a strong degree of flexibility to pursue further value-creation options for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
172899,403864026,1072495,"Cigna Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 bill",1087,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.
Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion; consolidated earnings of $503 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.94; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. This quarter's result reflects continued strong revenue and earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and improved results in our Group Disability and Life business.
Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $6.8 billion. Third quarter earnings were $416 million, reflecting continued strong performance in our commercial business, driven by customer growth, strong specialty results and favorable medical cost outcomes. Offsetting these strong commercial results were elevated costs in our Government business related to our CMS audit response and some loss ratio pressure, primarily in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. Premiums and fees grew 9% and earnings of $81 million represent growth of 31% quarter-over-quarter or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense discipline. This business continues to achieve attractive growth and profitability, as we deliver value to our customers with personalized and affordable offerings in the supplemental benefits space.
For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee growth up 4% over third quarter 2015. Third quarter earnings in our group business were $53 million, reflecting stabilized payment experience in our life book of business and sequential improvement in disability results, as the claim process modifications we made earlier this year continue to mature.
Additionally, we completed our annual disability reserve review in the third quarter, and consistent with our commentary last quarter, this review had di minimus impact on results.
Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and an improvement in our Group Disability and Life results with some elevated costs in our Government business. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.87 billion. This reflects continued strong performance in our commercial health care business, offset by a reduction of $60 million from previous expectations in our Government business, due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response as well as loss ratio pressure in our Medicaid business.
The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the low single-digit percentage range in 2016.
Turning to medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%, a 50 basis point improvement over our previous expectations. We continue to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients, as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization.
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business.
Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses.
For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, reflecting some pressure in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.
Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which continues to include the impact of spending on our CMS audit response.
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and, now, expect earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase over our previous outlook.
Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2016 earnings in the range of $80 million to $110 million. This also represents an increase in our earnings expectations per group.
Regarding our remaining operations, that is, other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2016.
So all-in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment.
Regarding free cash flow, year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company funds, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong.
Now to recap. We continue to invest in capabilities and programs across our businesses, which will deliver significant growth opportunities into the future. Our third quarter 2016 results reflects strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses, marked by continued positive momentum in our employer business --  Commercial Employer and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses as well as improvement in our Group Disability and Life business.
In our Government business, the increased investments that we're making with regard to our audit response, ensure that we are well positioned for long-term growth.
Overall, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2016 earnings outlook and are well positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2017.
With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Hence, those customers or members have very deep relationships with those physician groups. That is a highly retentive tool, not perfect, but it's a highly retentive tool because there is a deep relationship that's been built, there is expanded services and the like. So while we expect attrition and as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're planning for a revenue headwind in 2017, that will be offset by the attrition of the remediation cost.

Let me give you a -- just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers as we think about moving from '16 to '17.

Let me give you a -- just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers as we think about moving from '16 to '17. And I appreciate your reframing our long-term commitment of the 10% to 13% on average, which we've delivered on average over the last half a dozen years. Specifically, we see 3. We call it the 3 largest meaningful tailwinds that are specific and compelling. Number one, is the continued leverage of our well performing businesses, specifically, our U.S. employer health care business and our global individual business, where we expect to continue to deliver attractive, both, revenue and earnings growth. Second, is a meaningful step up in the margin performance of the Group Disability and Life business. And third is margin expansion in the Government business, where the --  largely the attrition of the cost profile that we've incurred this year, which was significant, will more than offset the revenue headwind. It's important to attach on top of that, that's going to take place under 1 or 2 environments. We'll either be in a, so-called, Plan A, where we were able to effectuate the combination and we're stepping into a different environment or a so-called, Plan B, where the government will stop and impede us in terms of the ability to combine. In a Plan B scenario, our estimate is toward the latter part of 2017, we'll have between $7 billion and $14 billion of deployable capital, which is made up of about $5 billion of free cash at the latter part of 2017. Leverage, that we could step up to one threshold if we're going to use it solely for internal purposes, dividend, buyback and the like. And the higher end of the range is, if we're going to use leverage largely to expand ourselves through M&A capacity. So taken as a whole, a significant uptick. I don't think it's constructive on this call to try to scroll the numbers around the underlying run rate. Suffice to say, 2016 is a choppy year for us. 2017 will be quite attractive. And if we expect to deliver certain numbers on average since this year is not an average year from a transition, we'd expect to have a very strong performance for 2017."

So think about $100 million after tax, which is significant. Secondly, you know us quite well, and you know even with the revised outlook for Group Disability and Life business, the earnings dislocation there is significant. And if you'll just project forward a mindset that our view is a stable and consistent performance of the life business, that's a meaningful step up. And then continued improvement in the disability business, there's a significant step up or an example to your point of a onetime dislocation when you would compare 2016 to '17.

First, by way of context, so this is a, obviously, a complex undertaking, and as I noted the $100 million reinforces it's complex in terms of what we're confronting here. We confronted an audit process that was changed and modernized for CMS so a new audit methodology. We operate a business model that functions off the more modern collaborative or value-based environment and what that means is we have a lot of partners. Think about entities that we work with in partnership to get that value-based environment, and think about better part of a couple hundred. So the ability to operate in this more modernized audit environment relative to that, which we believe is a big part of what the future health care looks like, required us to drive some changes. We're driving those changes, and we'll seek to get those resolved in short order. So we think we're in the latter phase, is point one. Two, we believe the large majority of those costs will not be reoccurring that, otherwise, will be contributors to 2017's earnings or the margin inflection. And third, we fully expect our retention levels to outperform the numbers that you referenced, largely based on the different orientation we have in one of our model, and we could look back and look at the retentive nature of our business over a long period of time in those relationships. So while we expect a revenue headwind that will be meaningful, our revenue headwind projection is not in line with the numbers you made reference to, and we think it's largely driven by the different model we have. Whereby, once our customers are with us a year or more they tend to be with us for a long, long time, largely because of those collaborative relationships."

As I referenced before, long-term customer relationships are an important part of our model because it facilitates the interaction back and forth through the value-based offerings. Clearly, we saw to improve margins in some of the markets that we're underperforming, with a portfolio our size, there's always opportunities in some select markets to improve margins, but that that's a market-by-market approach. So think, guiding force, stable benefits, stable offerings, the customer first orientation working with our physician collaboratives, looking at all the tools that are available to us, especially, in the markets that may be underperforming, some of those are the less mature markets.

In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2016 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded 2 charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items.
The first special item was an after-tax charge of $46 million, or $0.18 per share for merger-related transaction costs. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $25 million, or $0.10 per share related to a litigation matter. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of third quarter 2016 results.
Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

In my remarks today, I'll begin with a review of highlights from the third quarter. I'll also discuss how our ability to anticipate and meet customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs, continues to drive our business performance. And then I'll discuss how our well-positioned businesses continue to deliver strong results for the benefit of our shareholders, and how we're driving improvements for our businesses that are currently underperforming their potential. We are doing all of this, while we continue to prepare for the future by investing in capabilities that meet customers' needs, and while we continue to support the litigation process with our proposed Anthem combination.
Next, Tom, will provide more detail around our third quarter financial performance, and our full year outlook. And following your questions, I'll conclude our conversation with just a few closing remarks.
Let's begin with some highlights from the quarter. Our third quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion over the third quarter 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of $503 million, or $1.94 per share, reflecting strong performance in our Commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and improving results in our Group Disability and Life segment. Our actions continue to be guided by our proven strategy of Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual. With a focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers and clients through ongoing innovation, and a commitment to being a trusted partner as well as continuing investments for future growth and capabilities which deliver affordable, personalized solutions and further expand our geographic reach.
Around the world, individuals are seeking access to quality health care and sense of security programs that are both of high quality and affordable. At the same time, employers of all sizes and across all industries and geographies increasingly recognize that healthier, more engaged and productive workforces are essential to driving their businesses forward, while they continue to seek solutions that are affordable and sustainable.
Amid this backdrop, many individuals and employers are concerned that they must accept either constrained access or diminished quality, or both in order to achieve affordability of care. At Cigna, we see it differently. We have demonstrated that quality and affordability can be achieved by designing personally tailored access and high-quality care delivery with engagement, alignment and support for individuals and health care professionals. We deliver this through personalized and localized benefits as well as services for our customers, which empower and support their actions and decision making and enable them to find the right balance of access, quality and affordability.
At the same time, we support health care professionals with actionable insights in further expanded care resources, all while ensuring alignment with them to deliver superior quality and improved affordability. To further innovate for our customers and clients, we're accelerating investments in value-based care programs and incentive payment models with our provider partners that continue to drive enhancements in both care quality and affordability.
For example, today, we have 160 collaborative accountable care arrangements which span 29 states, and we serve well over 2 million customers in these value-based programs. Our success in driving increased affordability is reflected in our continued delivery of industry-leading medical cost trend.
In support of that, 82% of our more mature collaborative relationships with large physician groups have outperformed the market in total medical cost. This leadership in physician partnership was also, most recently, validated through Cigna's first place ranking amongst 214 companies in athenahealth's provider satisfaction survey. Although, to anticipate, identify and help satisfy these needs continues to resonate with our customers and clients as well as our provider partners.
Importantly, across all of our businesses, our customer and client experience remains at high levels. As a result, we tend to remain strong, and this presents ongoing opportunities for further expansion of our customer and client relationships Importantly, these long-term relationships allow us to support individuals more meaningfully across their life and health stages.
Now relative to our businesses, we have an opportunity to improve performance. Throughout the third quarter, we made solid progress in our efforts to improve the financial results of our Group Disability and Life segment. As the model begins to mature, this will lead to a further differentiated customer experience.
Relative to Cigna-HealthSpring, we continue to make progress in the CMS audit remediation work. Our focus remains on completing this work and growing our business with industry-leading collaborative relationships, all to drive positive outcomes for the benefit of seniors. We expect to emerge from this work with a stronger, more sustainable model that ensures seniors will continue to receive the highest quality service experience and clinical outcomes.
So to summarize, our well-performing businesses continue to deliver strong results, and we are driving improvements where needed. This combined with our ongoing investments for the future, and our tremendous capital resources positions us with strength and flexibility to deliver sustained value for our customers and clients and differentiated results for our shareholders.
Now as we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver attractive financial performance and growth. We see a number of earnings tailwinds, including: Continued strong performance of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, with high customer retention levels and solid revenue and earnings growth; second, more meaningful improvement in the margin for our disability and life business; and third, meaningful margin improvement for our Seniors business, with a ramp down of remediation cost will more than offset the headwind caused by the revenue reductions that we expect for 2017 in this business.
As always, there may be variability in 2017 in the rate and pace of both medical utilization as well as the pace of our strategic investments. When we take the tailwinds and headwinds as a whole, and consider our significant capital position and ongoing strong free cash flow generation, we are well positioned for an attractive 2017.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate some of the key points from my remarks this morning. Cigna is operating a well-positioned, diversified portfolio of businesses, dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and delivering value through engagement, incentive alignment and support services. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue our momentum in our well-performing businesses and improve the results in some of our historical strong businesses. Our long-term objective remains commitment to our annual growth of 10% to 13% EPS on average, all while we continue to invest back in our company. And the high levels of ongoing free cash flow generated from our diverse business portfolio and tremendous capital resources available for deployment give us a strong degree of flexibility to pursue further value-creation options for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
172899,403864026,1073581,"Cigna Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 bill",1087,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.
Key financial highlights in the quarter are: Consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion; consolidated earnings of $503 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.94; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. This quarter's result reflects continued strong revenue and earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and improved results in our Group Disability and Life business.
Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $6.8 billion. Third quarter earnings were $416 million, reflecting continued strong performance in our commercial business, driven by customer growth, strong specialty results and favorable medical cost outcomes. Offsetting these strong commercial results were elevated costs in our Government business related to our CMS audit response and some loss ratio pressure, primarily in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.
Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business. Premiums and fees grew 9% and earnings of $81 million represent growth of 31% quarter-over-quarter or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense discipline. This business continues to achieve attractive growth and profitability, as we deliver value to our customers with personalized and affordable offerings in the supplemental benefits space.
For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee growth up 4% over third quarter 2015. Third quarter earnings in our group business were $53 million, reflecting stabilized payment experience in our life book of business and sequential improvement in disability results, as the claim process modifications we made earlier this year continue to mature.
Additionally, we completed our annual disability reserve review in the third quarter, and consistent with our commentary last quarter, this review had di minimus impact on results.
Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our commercial health care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and an improvement in our Group Disability and Life results with some elevated costs in our Government business. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.87 billion. This reflects continued strong performance in our commercial health care business, offset by a reduction of $60 million from previous expectations in our Government business, due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response as well as loss ratio pressure in our Medicaid business.
The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following: Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the low single-digit percentage range in 2016.
Turning to medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%, a 50 basis point improvement over our previous expectations. We continue to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients, as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization.
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business.
Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses.
For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, reflecting some pressure in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.
Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which continues to include the impact of spending on our CMS audit response.
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and, now, expect earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase over our previous outlook.
Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2016 earnings in the range of $80 million to $110 million. This also represents an increase in our earnings expectations per group.
Regarding our remaining operations, that is, other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2016.
So all-in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment.
Regarding free cash flow, year-to-date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company funds, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong.
Now to recap. We continue to invest in capabilities and programs across our businesses, which will deliver significant growth opportunities into the future. Our third quarter 2016 results reflects strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses, marked by continued positive momentum in our employer business --  Commercial Employer and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses as well as improvement in our Group Disability and Life business.
In our Government business, the increased investments that we're making with regard to our audit response, ensure that we are well positioned for long-term growth.
Overall, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2016 earnings outlook and are well positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2017.
With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Our working assumption is that we will not be participating in the open enrollment period. Specific to the actions, I'm not going to delineate the specific actions you can and cannot take. There's clear rules in terms of what you can do, in terms of what the marketing versus retention activities. I think the most important thing to highlight is, within our model, you recall that our model is largely based where the majority of our lives are, in terms of very mature physician collaborative models. Hence, those customers or members have very deep relationships with those physician groups. That is a highly retentive tool, not perfect, but it's a highly retentive tool because there is a deep relationship that's been built, there is expanded services and the like. So while we expect attrition and as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're planning for a revenue headwind in 2017, that will be offset by the attrition of the remediation cost. We expect retention to perform better than the historical norms of a sanctioned environment. As it relates to '17, as soon as we're off sanctions, we'd be back in the monthly enrollment process, and we look forward to that environment."

Let me give you a -- just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers as we think about moving from '16 to '17. And I appreciate your reframing our long-term commitment of the 10% to 13% on average, which we've delivered on average",381,"Joshua, it's David. Let me give you a -- just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers as we think about moving from '16 to '17. And I appreciate your reframing our long-term commitment of the 10% to 13% on average, which we've delivered on average over the last half a dozen years. Specifically, we see 3. We call it the 3 largest meaningful tailwinds that are specific and compelling. Number one, is the continued leverage of our well performing businesses, specifically, our U.S. employer health care business and our global individual business, where we expect to continue to deliver attractive, both, revenue and earnings growth. Second, is a meaningful step up in the margin performance of the Group Disability and Life business. And third is margin expansion in the Government business, where the --  largely the attrition of the cost profile that we've incurred this year, which was significant, will more than offset the revenue headwind. It's important to attach on top of that, that's going to take place under 1 or 2 environments. We'll either be in a, so-called, Plan A, where we were able to effectuate the combination and we're stepping into a different environment or a so-called, Plan B, where the government will stop and impede us in terms of the ability to combine. In a Plan B scenario, our estimate is toward the latter part of 2017, we'll have between $7 billion and $14 billion of deployable capital, which is made up of about $5 billion of free cash at the latter part of 2017. Leverage, that we could step up to one threshold if we're going to use it solely for internal purposes, dividend, buyback and the like. And the higher end of the range is, if we're going to use leverage largely to expand ourselves through M&A capacity. So taken as a whole, a significant uptick. I don't think it's constructive on this call to try to scroll the numbers around the underlying run rate. Suffice to say, 2016 is a choppy year for us. 2017 will be quite attractive. And if we expect to deliver certain numbers on average since this year is not an average year from a transition, we'd expect to have a very strong performance for 2017."

So think about $100 million after tax, which is significant. Secondly, you know us quite well, and you know even with the revised outlook for Group Disability and Life business, the earnings dislocation there is significant. And if you'll just project forward a mindset that our view is a stable and consistent performance of the life business, that's a meaningful step up. And then continued improvement in the disability business, there's a significant step up or an example to your point of a onetime dislocation when you would compare 2016 to '17. Albeit, we don't  expect to be at full earnings potential in 2017 because disability will ramp throughout the course of the year. Those are 2 items I'd ask you to focus on."

First, by way of context, so this is a, obviously, a complex undertaking, and as I noted the $100 million reinforces it's complex in terms of what we're confronting here. We confronted an audit process that was changed and modernized for CMS so a new audit methodology. We operate a business model that functions off the more modern collaborative or value-based environment and what that means is we have a lot of partners. Think about entities that we work with in partnership to get that value-based environment, and think about better part of a couple hundred. So the ability to operate in this more modernized audit environment relative to that, which we believe is a big part of what the future health care looks like, required us to drive some changes. We're driving those changes, and we'll seek to get those resolved in short order. So we think we're in the latter phase, is point one. Two, we believe the large majority of those costs will not be reoccurring that, otherwise, will be contributors to 2017's earnings or the margin inflection. And third, we fully expect our retention levels to outperform the numbers that you referenced, largely based on the different orientation we have in one of our model, and we could look back and look at the retentive nature of our business over a long period of time in those relationships. So while we expect a revenue headwind that will be meaningful, our revenue headwind projection is not in line with the numbers you made reference to, and we think it's largely driven by the different model we have. Whereby, once our customers are with us a year or more they tend to be with us for a long, long time, largely because of those collaborative relationships."

You could actually look at, to your point, you could look at our attrition rates throughout the course of the year as we've been able to manage the business. Point two, is the remediation costs will essentially -- the large majority of those costs will attrit next year, which will offset the earnings implication. For out sweeping numbers, we expect to grow the franchise in aggregate revenue numbers because of the strength of the business as I referenced before, the U.S. Commercial Employer business, the Global Supplemental Benefits business, our specialty portfolio, et cetera,  and that will more than offset the revenue implications here as well. Lastly, order magnitude, you can think about $1 billion of revenue that, unfortunately, currently is low margin. We'll step the margin up, and that will more than offset the earnings implication from that as we look through the attrition, both the member month attrition for this year as well as the open enrollment attrition for next year."

We'd expect to have significant -- continued ongoing strong performance there. And as far as splitting the difference in the variance in the quarter, it splits about 60, 40 Medicaid.

As you recall, we have been, I'll say, cautious and slow in this space is the headline. As we viewed the opening of this marketplace in 2014 as probably being much smaller than projections, not profitable for the industry and choppy or less-than-stable operationally. And unfortunately, societally, it's proven to be more right than wrong. We entered 5 markets, and we deliberately and slowly grew to 7 markets. As we look to 2017, our initial plan had us growing into 10 markets. After assessing all the market dynamics, we're going to end up in 7 markets in 2017, but a different mix, where we will shrink our footprint in 3 markets by leaving 3 markets on the exchange. And then we'll have a new offering in 3 different markets, specifically, built on our collaborative model. So some change in the overall profile of our marketplace, but a smaller geographic footprint than we were anticipating. We anticipated going from 7 to 10. We're going to actually be in 7 with a different mix. Net-net, taking it all as a whole, for next year, we're going to expect to see some revenue growth there.
