I'm going to let Jeff handle the 2015 recap in his upcoming comments, and I want to jump right into the news we announced today beginning with Slide 4.
With today's announcement regarding reductions in our operating plan and our dividend, we have taken significant actions to reset the company in response to much lower commodity prices and tightening credit markets across the industry. These are 2 factors that we have -- that have changed significantly in our view in a short period of time. And they have important implications for the sector, especially in 2016 and '17. 
Regarding prices, there are 3 factors that are driving our actions: first, current prices are much lower than we expected at the time we announced our 2016 operating plan. This is amid bearish supply-demand signals and record levels of inventories. Brent is currently trading 40% lower than 2015 average prices. 
Second, we believe this downturn could last a while longer. Just a few months ago, we thought the market would rebalance by the second half of 2016. Now it looks like that could stretch into 2017. 
And third, greater concerns about global growth suggests it could take longer to reach an equilibrium mid-cycle price after balancing occurs. Now certainly, there's a lot of debate about these factors but we can't bet on prices turning quickly. Instead, we're taking what we believe are prudent actions to prepare for a weaker price environment and for a longer period of time.
Regarding the credit markets, it's no secret that the credit rating agencies also see a likelihood of a weaker, more protracted downturn. Recently, Moody's and S&P have issued significantly lower price decks. The agencies have industry under review for credit rating downgrades. Moody's has stated that multi-notch rating downgrades are likely and some have already occurred. The consequences of these downgrades are that debt capacity will shrink across the sector. 
For ConocoPhillips, the bottom line is this: we're going to take actions to maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe this is critical and will be a key differentiator in this business. So as difficult as these choices are, and they were very difficult, we must do the right thing for the company. 
As we announced, we're taking 2 key actions to respond to these factors. First, we are further reducing our 2016 operating plan capital and operating expense. Now for the past 18 months, we've lowered CapEx and OpEx levels across the company as prices have weakened, and we're doing it again in 2016. And that's shown on Slide 5. 
This slide summarized our revised 2016 operating plan. It represents a significant shift compared to last year and an even bigger shift compared to 2014. Now importantly, these reductions we're making will improve net cash flow in 2016 by $2 billion compared to the plan we laid out in December. 
On the left side of this chart, you can see we're lowering our 2016 capital expenditures to $6.4 billion. That's a reduction of $3.7 billion compared with 2015 and $1.3 billion compared to our original 2016 operating plan. We're dropping down to 3 rigs in the Lower 48 because it doesn't make economic sense to maintain our regional level of activity at current prices, and we don't lose acreage or optionality. We're cutting other discretionary programs across the business, which are somewhat offset by anticipated cash calls in our equity affiliates.
Our original plan anticipated 1% to 3% production growth in 2016. Now we expect flat production, given these capital cuts. We're letting Lower 48 volumes decline but these will be offset in the near term from ramp-up at APLNG and in the oil sands.
Finally, we continued to improve our operating costs. We set an initial budget of $7.7 billion for 2016. We're now lowering that to $7 billion. But we don't believe these reductions are sufficient to maintain our strong balance sheet under the lower for longer circumstances I just described. And so we've taken a second and more difficult step of reducing the dividend. This morning, we announced reducing the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share effective with the first quarter 2016 dividend payment and this was discussed on Slide 6.
In mid-December, we reaffirmed that our dividend is the top priority use of cash. In 2016, this was premised on using up to a couple billion dollars of balance sheet capacity based on similar prices to 2015. After making those adjustments to our operating plan that I just reviewed, we analyzed the impact to our balance sheet under conditions where prices stay in the $30s for longer. We came to the conclusion that our balance sheet could get stretched beyond a prudent level. 
Ultimately, we believe we needed to make a tough choice between protecting the current level of the dividend or maintaining our strong balance sheet through an extended downturn. We made the decision to reduce the dividend. This action, combined with the operating plan reductions, will improve net cash flow by about $4.4 billion in 2016. 
Once we made that decision, our primary consideration was to set a dividend that will be sustainable through the cycles. We are balancing several objectives, including yield, financial strength and lowering the breakeven cost of our business. We set the dividend at a level that we believe results in a competitive yield. 
The dividend will continue to be a top priority. It provides important discipline on our investment programs and will remain a core part of our offering. We believe our dividend is at a level that preserves balance sheet strength and provides financial flexibility through the current downturn. These actions also lower our breakeven price to roughly $45 per barrel Brent. And what we mean here is that we can keep production flat and pay our dividend for many years at $45 per barrel without needing to sell assets or increase our debt levels. 
This significant improvement in our breakeven price will allow us to generate greater profitability and cash flow growth when the cycle turns. And the combined reset of capital, operating cost and the dividend will enable us to generate free cash flow that we can deploy across a range of choices, including increased investment into our low cost of supply resource base but also including returning capital to shareholders. The reset will allow us to grow our dividend in the future as our cash flows grow and at a much lower mid-cycle price.
That goes without saying that these were very difficult actions to take. But they will improve our ability to manage through the price weakness the industry is facing. They will improve our medium-term outlook by allowing us to accelerate performance as prices turn. And they will help the long-term performance of the business by making us more resilient in a world of lower, more volatile prices. 
So now let me turn it over to Jeff and Matt and I'll come back at the end to conclude my remarks."

And as Ryan said, I'll open with some brief comments about 2015, the summary of which are shown on this page. Measured against the standard of delivering the things within our control, it was a strong year. Strategically, we lowered our capital expenditures by more than 40% compared to 2014. We achieved $2.2 billion in disposition proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, primarily North American gas assets, and announced our intention to begin a phased exit of deepwater exploration. 
Operationally, we achieved 5% year-over-year production growth, excluding Libya and downtime dispositions. That exceeded our initial guidance for the year and came mostly from the development drilling programs and a ramp-up of production from our major projects. We also achieved first production from Surmont 2 and first LNG from APLNG, which are big milestones for the company.
Financially, we have an adjusted net loss of $1.7 billion or $1.40 per share. This includes a fourth quarter adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion or $0.90 a share. We recognize that analyst consensus was a negative 64% -- $0.64 per share, and we believe this difference primarily reflects the $506 million in dryhole expense in the quarter in our adjusted earnings, which we think is about 15% -- $0.15 higher than consensus estimates. FX impacts accounts for the balance of this difference.
Finally, we had $7.6 billion in cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, and ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I'll now walk through our cash flow waterfall on Slide 9. On this chart, you can see the major buckets of cash sources and uses for the year. We started the year with $5.1 billion in cash and generated $7.6 billion from operating activities, excluding working capital. Working capital was about $1 billion use of cash during the year.
We captured about $2.2 billion of net proceeds from dispositions and took on about $2.4 billion of debt. Our 2015 capital expenditures were $10.1 billion. After accounting for dividends and some other items, we ended the year with $2.4 billion in cash.
Turning to Slide 10. I'll cover some thoughts on the balance sheet. A period of low prices highlights the importance of a strong balance sheet in the cyclical business. However, a consequence of the recent price drops has been that credit rating agencies have become very pessimistic about future prices. And they are currently reviewing the industry's credit ratings using much lower forecasted prices. 
We should see industry-wide credit downgrades over the next couple of months, with a potential for multi-notch downgrades in some cases. Across the industry, this is going to result in reduced debt capacity within given earning bands compared to just a few months ago. We believe the reduction in the dividend and the substantially lower risk of significant borrowings as a result of that decision will help mitigate the credit rating impacts.
We are well positioned should we need to acquire additional debt capital. We ended 2015 with over $8 billion in liquidity comprised of $2.4 billion in cash and about $6 billion of available debt capacity on our revolving credit facilities. We expect to see significant levels of borrowings among our peer companies this year. And our liquidity balance will give us the flexibility to access the capital markets at the time of our choosing and avoid a very crowded energy market for energy sector debt this year.
In terms of how much debt we will need to raise in 2016, our current estimate is that we will utilize our cash balances and not need significant additional debt if oil prices average around $40 for the year. 
By making the difficult decision to reduce our dividends, we believe we are positioned to preserve a strong balance sheet in a prolonged period of low prices such as the ones we're seeing today. While we have been successful over the last several years in selling assets at full value, during a period of higher prices and strong demand for assets, another important benefit of making the changes we announced this morning and maintaining balance sheet capacity is that asset sales are not necessary to bridge funding gaps.
That concludes my comments. Note that our appendix includes some updated net income sensitivities and some additional 2016 guidance items. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for his operational comments."

Finer reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February but we don't expect these numbers to change significantly. On Slide 12, you'll see that we start",602,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll review our operational performance beginning with our 2015 reserves. Finer reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February but we don't expect these numbers to change significantly. 
On Slide 12, you'll see that we started the year with 8.9 billion barrels of reserves. We produced 610 million barrels and had additions of 523 million, excluding market factors. So on that basis, our adjusted replacement ratio was 86%. However, because our portfolio is dominated by tax and royalty regimes, there were significant price-related reserve impacts in 2015. 
The lower price effect reduced our year-end reserves by 353 million BOE. In addition, also due to lower prices, we've reduced our expected capital program for the next several years. This slower pace of development has resulted in the [indiscernible] reduction of 111 million BOE. Now these combined 600 -- 464 million barrels have not gone away because prices have dropped so we expect to reserves as prices improve.
Adjusting our additions for the price effect on the planned capital reductions, we had organic reserve additions of 59 million barrels, which results in an organic reserve replacement ratio of 10% of 2015 production. Reserves were further reduced by 175 million BOE, primarily as a result of non-core asset dispositions. So our total reserve replacement ratio, including both dispositions and market factors, was negative 19%. As I said, more details will be available in our 10-K filing.
Now I'll cover our operational priorities for the year on the next slide. The midpoint of our 2016 production range is expected to be essentially flat to 2015 production when you adjust out the full year effects of asset sales. In the first quarter, production is expected to be between 1,540,000 and 1,580,000 BOE per day. Production will be lower in the second and third quarters as we see our usual downtime for major turnarounds. And then in the fourth quarter as we move out of turnaround season, we'll see increased production associated with major project ramps in places like Surmont 2 and APLNG and the production associated with development activity across the globe. 
In Alaska, we're still progressing our GMT1 project and our winter exploration program around the existing infrastructure. In the Lower 48, we'll be focused on assessing the results of multiple pilot tests we conducted in 2015. This will allow us to optimize development plans as we prepare for a future ramp-up as our price outlook improves. We also expect to complete our Gulf of Mexico exploration programs before year-end.
In Canada, ramp-up continues at Surmont 2 and we have 2 exploration wells being drilled offshore Nova Scotia. In our Europe and North Africa segment, we'll continue development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk Area, and we expect first production from Alder in the second half of the year. At APLNG, we're now shipping LNG from Train 1. We've shipped 4 cargoes already and the plant is running well. We also expect the stack-up of Train 2 in the second half of the year. Finally, in Other International, the second well on our offshore Senegal SNE discovery had very encouraging test rates. We've just finished drilling the third well and are currently preparing to test.
It looks like 2016 may be an even more challenging year for the industry than we experienced in 2015. But we remain focused on what we can control, delivering best-in-class operational and safety performance, and we are ready to ramp up the development of our diverse, flexible, low cost of supply resource base when prices recover. Now I'll turn the call back to Ryan to wrap up."

This -- the world has changed and been a dramatic drop in prices, so we're seeing and enduring a much lower drop in prices. And as we look at the fundamentals, it looks like balancing, probably shifting to later in 2016 and possibly moving into 2017. So really it was the depth of the drop over the last 8 weeks to 2 months, combined with the duration. And the inventory doesn't seem to be flattening, let alone starting to drop off. And that, combined with the last month of conversations that we've been having with the rating agencies. And clearly, the debt capacity is going to be reduced. So when we came out with our operating plan in December, we talked about using the balance sheet to get through the cycle. And now the capacity is reduced, the cycle is deepened and potentially gotten longer. So we have to prepare for that. And we made the difficult decision of preserving the balance sheet over the dividend that time. You asked about the mid-cycle price. That's a tough one. It looks like it's going to be longer to get there, and there's some downsides, some upsides to that conversation. The downside, the supply has certainly been more resilient than most people expected and we're still building inventory. Certainly, OPEC for now is protecting price or not protecting price and doing that, so they are protecting market share. I think we've seen the resiliency in the unconventional revolutions. It's opened up a new supply source that is more flexible, low cost of supply than some of the other conventional production like deepwater. And certainly some concerns about economic growth. So those are kind of the things that the downside that would suggest a lower mid-cycle price. But there's other factors. Certainly, the capital cuts that the industry is making should result in a supply rebound or a supply shock to the downside. And certainly, the Saudis could lead OPEC to a different decision whenever they feel like the point they're trying to make has been made. And certainly, the lower prices are stimulating demand. So there's pieces on both sides of this thing that balance out the concern about where mid-cycles might be going to. In the past, we've had a view of mid-cycle prices in the mid-$70s but we're currently taking a look at that."

I think at the risk of repeating myself here a little bit, I think it's -- we'll differentiate ourselves because of the low cost of supply, deep resource base we have captured in the company today and the exploitation of it. It's flexible, it's shorter cycle time. It'll be much more predictable, and it will generate free cash flow at a much, much lower breakeven price for the company. So we'll have choices, we'll have choices to make as we go forward and the recovery occurs and prices start to come back, which we believe that will happen, and we can -- we'll have choice around how we do that, how we -- what kind of growth we think we want to generate because we know we have the portfolio to go do that. Now we're not talking about high single- and double-digit growth rates. That's not what we're talking about with our company. But we have a more predictable low-cost supply of flexible resource base that we can invest in. And when we generate free cash flow, we can decide what to go with it. We're committed to do the dividend. It's still a priority first use of our cash and growing that as our cash flows grow."

As you said, there's about $700 million or $800 million going into APLNG, for example, to finish Train 2. There's about $300 million going into Clear Ridge to move that towards completion. And about the same going into Malakai in Malaysia. So these are projects that are getting very close to completion. We've got development capital program of just over $2 billion, $2.2 billion. And despite the cuts that we're doing in the Lower 48, there's still $800 million of that going into North America and as we ramp down our rig program. And then we have, as you mentioned, an exploration program going on as quite significant deepwater component next year as we finish our deepwater program. That's a total of $1.2 billion. So we're going to be looking to execute all of that at lower cost and execute all that scope at lower cost. But our current expectation is about the $6.4 billion, and that cutting any further would not be prudent not been the best long-term interest of value creation for the shareholders.

I think what it started leverage target credit rating, particularly in the credit rating side, it's kind of hard to answer any kind of thought about a target credit rating agencies because the rating agencies are going a lot through quite a change on how they assess the industry. We don't know what really right now what debt levels are going to correlate to what credit rating. So I think the direction of your question is right it's just how do we think about level of our debt going forward. And just some general comments about debt. If you think about what we've done over the last several years, we ended 2015 with $24.9 billion so essentially $25 billion for the debt. And 3 years ago, at 2012, we had $22 billion worth of debt. So unlike some of the peers that -- in our company, we've not really had a significant amount of debt in the last several years. And really what we've been doing as we've been an independent E&P as we funded our capital program and our dividends mostly from cash from operations and selling noncore assets. And then we quickly made adjustments to our capital program and our operating cost structure as the circumstances have changed try to limit our debt borrowing. So that's history. So going forward how do we think about the question of the right level of debt and what makes sense different mid-cycle prices. So last year, we generated $7.5 billion of cash flow in kind of what was a $50-ish price environment. 2014, the year before that, we generated $16 billion of cash flow in what was kind of a $90 price environment. And when you think mid-cycle prices going to be somewhere in that range between $50 and $90. But it would -- we can look at $25 billion of debt though and feel like that's a reasonable animal amount of debt to have in either of those kind of mid-cycle scenarios. So consequently, as prices improve, we don't feel like we're going to be compelled to use cash flows to reduce debt levels. So delevering is not going to be a priority for us. But we're not comfortable, and this is what you heard from us today is we're not comfortable with having a plan that relies on the heavy use of debt financing to fund cash shortfalls in a period of really low prices. And that's where we felt like we were going to be if we continued the current dividend, that we'd be rapidly using balance sheet capacity while we're waiting on some kind of commodity price improvement."

I guess what I'm a little surprised about is why you maintain it at all with $45 breakeven and the current prices around $30. I guess, I'm just a little bit concerned we're not setting up for another potential cut down the road if current prices persist. Can you maybe just talk all bit about how we should think about the ongoing evaluation of the dividend sustainability if $30 were maintained for the next say, 6 to 12 months."

But we've also seen we didn't anticipate that it would go this low, and the potential will be here for this long. So we were surprised probably by the resiliency of the North American, the efficiencies, the economies that we've been able to drive as an industry that's kept supply going. We've surprised that OpEx held on for as long as they have to keep their decision going. So it's been a confluence of factors. We felt like the dividend was certainly manageable at a $75 mid-cycle price. We have concerns about how long that's going to get there and that, combined with the reduction in capacity of the balance sheet. We still have capacity on the balance sheet. We'll use that if we need to through this lower price cycle. We just wanted to protect that to make sure we had a plan in place for a lower for longer outlook. It's prudent to plan for the downside case. We're going to do right for the company both from the short, medium and long term."

I'm going to let Jeff handle the 2015 recap in his upcoming comments, and I want to jump right into the news we announced today beginning with Slide 4.
With today's announcement regarding reductions in our operating plan and our dividend, we have taken significant actions to reset the company in response to much lower commodity prices and tightening credit markets across the industry. These are 2 factors that we have -- that have changed significantly in our view in a short period of time, and they have important implications for the sector, especially in 2016 and '17. 
Regarding prices, there are 3 factors that are driving our actions. First, current prices are much lower than we expected at the time we announced our 2016 operating plan. This is amid bearish supply-demand signals and record levels of inventories. Brent is currently trading 40% lower than 2015 average prices. 
Second, we believe this downturn could last a while longer. Just a few months ago, we thought the market would rebalance by the second half of 2016. Now it looks like that could stretch into 2017. 
And third, greater concerns about global growth suggests it could take longer to reach an equilibrium mid-cycle price after balancing occurs. Now certainly there's a lot of debate about these factors but we can't bet on prices turning quickly. Instead, we're taking what we believe are prudent actions to prepare for a weaker price environment and for a longer period of time.
Regarding the credit markets, it's no secret that the credit rating agencies also see a likelihood of a weaker, more protracted downturn. Recently, Moody's and S&P have issued significantly lower price decks. The agencies have industry under review for credit rating downgrades. Moody's has stated that multi-notch rating downgrades are likely and some have already occurred. The consequences of these downgrades are the debt capacity will shrink across the sector. 
For ConocoPhillips, the bottom line is this: we're going to take actions to maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe this is critical and will be a key differentiator in this business. So as difficult as these choices are, and they were very difficult, we must do the right thing for the company. 
As we announced, we're taking 2 key actions to respond to these factors. First, we are further reducing our 2016 operating plan capital and operating expense. Now for the past 18 months, we've lowered CapEx and OpEx levels across the company as prices have weakened, and we're doing it again in 2016. And that's shown on Slide 5. 
This slide summarized our revised 2016 operating plan. It represents a significant shift compared to last year and an even bigger shift compared to 2014. Now importantly, these reductions we're making will improve net cash flow in 2016 by $2 billion compared to the plan we laid out in December. 
On the left side of this chart, you can see we're lowering our 2016 capital expenditures to $6.4 billion. That's a reduction of $3.7 billion compared with 2015 and $1.3 billion compared to our original 2016 operating plan. We're dropping down to 3 rigs in the Lower 48 because it doesn't make economic sense to maintain our regional level of activity at current prices, and we don't lose acreage or optionality. We're cutting other discretionary programs across the business, which are somewhat offset by anticipated cash calls in our equity affiliates.
Our original plan anticipated 1% to 3% production growth in 2016. Now we expect flat production, given these capital cuts. We're letting Lower 48 volumes decline but these will be offset in the near term from ramp-up at APLNG and in the oil sands.
Finally, we continue to improve our operating costs. We set an initial budget of $7.7 billion for 2016. We're now lowering that to $7 billion. But we don't believe these reductions are sufficient to maintain our strong balance sheet under the lower for longer circumstances I just described. And so we've taken a second and more difficult step of reducing the dividend. This morning, we announced reducing the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share effective with the first quarter 2016 dividend payment and this was discussed on Slide 6.
In mid-December, we reaffirmed that our dividend is the top priority use of cash. In 2016, this was premised on using up to a couple billion dollars of balance sheet capacity based on similar prices to 2015. After making those adjustments to our operating plan that I just reviewed, we analyzed the impact to our balance sheet under conditions where prices stay in the $30s for longer. We came to the conclusion that our balance sheet could get stretched beyond a prudent level. 
Ultimately, we believe we needed to make a tough choice between protecting the current level of the dividend or maintaining our strong balance sheet through an extended downturn. We made the decision to reduce the dividend. This action, combined with the operating plan reductions, will improve net cash flow by about $4.4 billion in 2016. 
Once we made that decision, our primary consideration was to set a dividend that will be sustainable through the cycles. We are balancing several objectives, including yield, financial strength and lowering the breakeven cost of our business. We set the dividend at a level that we believe results in a competitive yield. 
The dividend will continue to be a top priority. It provides important discipline on our investment programs and will remain a core part of our offering. We believe our dividend is at a level that preserves balance sheet strength and provides financial flexibility through the current downturn. These actions also lower our breakeven price to roughly $45 per barrel Brent. And what we mean here is that we can keep production flat and pay our dividend for many years at $45 per barrel without needing to sell assets or increase our debt levels. 
This significant improvement in our breakeven price will allow us to generate greater profitability and cash flow growth when the cycle turns. And the combined reset of capital, operating cost and the dividend will enable us to generate free cash flow that we can deploy across a range of choices, including increased investment into our low cost of supply resource base but also including returning capital to shareholders. The reset will allow us to grow our dividend in the future as our cash flows grow and at a much lower mid-cycle price.
That goes without saying that these were very difficult actions to take. But they will improve our ability to manage through the price weakness the industry is facing. They will improve our medium-term outlook by allowing us to accelerate performance as prices turn. And they will help the long-term performance of the business by making us more resilient in a world of lower, more volatile prices. 
So now let me turn it over to Jeff and Matt and I'll come back at the end to conclude my remarks."

And as Ryan said, I'll open with some brief comments about 2015, the summary of which are shown on this page. Measured against the standard of delivering the things within our control, it was a strong year. Strategically, we lowered our capital expenditures by more than 40% compared to 2014. We achieved $2.2 billion in disposition proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, primarily North American gas assets, and announced our intention to begin a phased exit of deepwater exploration. 
Operationally, we achieved 5% year-over-year production growth, excluding Libya and downtime and dispositions. That exceeded our initial guidance for the year and came mostly from the development drilling programs and a ramp-up of production from our major projects. We also achieved first production from Surmont 2 and first LNG from APLNG, which are big milestones for the company.
Financially, we have an adjusted net loss of $1.7 billion or $1.40 per share. This includes a fourth quarter adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion or $0.90 a share. We recognize that analyst consensus was a negative 64% -- $0.64 per share, and we believe this difference primarily reflects the $506 million of dry hole expense in the quarter in our adjusted earnings, which we think is about 15% -- $0.15 higher than consensus estimates. FX impacts accounts for the balance of this difference.
Finally, we had $7.6 billion in cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, and ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I'll now walk through our cash flow waterfall on Slide 9. On this chart, you can see the major buckets of cash sources and uses for the year. We started the year with $5.1 billion in cash and generated $7.6 billion from operating activities, excluding working capital. Working capital was about $1 billion use of cash during the year.
We captured about $2.2 billion of net proceeds from dispositions and took on about $2.4 billion of debt. Our 2015 capital expenditures were $10.1 billion. And after accounting for dividends and some other items, we ended the year with $2.4 billion in cash.
Turning to Slide 10. I'll cover some thoughts on the balance sheet. A period of low prices highlights the importance of a strong balance sheet in the cyclical business. However, a consequence of the recent price drops has been that credit rating agencies have become very pessimistic about future prices. And they are currently reviewing the industry's credit ratings using much lower forecasted prices. 
We should see industry-wide credit downgrades over the next couple of months, with a potential for multi-notch downgrades in some cases. Across the industry, this is going to result in reduced debt capacity within given earning bands compared to just a few months ago. We believe the reduction in the dividend and the substantially lower risk of significant borrowings as a result of that decision will help mitigate the credit rating impacts.
We are well positioned should we need to acquire additional debt capital. We ended 2015 with over $8 billion in liquidity comprised of $2.4 billion in cash and about $6 billion of available debt capacity on our revolving credit facilities. We expect to see significant levels of borrowings among our peer companies this year. And our liquidity balance will give us the flexibility to access the capital markets at the time of our choosing and avoid a very crowded energy market for energy sector debt this year.
In terms of how much debt we will need to raise in 2016, our current estimate is that we will utilize our cash balances and not need significant additional debt if oil prices average around $40 for the year. 
By making the difficult decision to reduce our dividends, we believe we are positioned to preserve a strong balance sheet in a prolonged period of low prices such as the ones we're seeing today. While we have been successful over the last several years in selling assets at full value, during a period of higher prices and strong demand for assets, another important benefit of making the changes we announced this morning and maintaining balance sheet capacity is that asset sales are not necessary to bridge funding gaps.
That concludes my comments. Note that our appendix includes some updated net income sensitivities and some additional 2016 guidance items. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for his operational comments."

I'll review our operational performance beginning with our 2015 reserves. Finer reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February but we don't expect these numbers to change significantly. 
On Slide 12, you'll see that we started the year with 8.9 billion barrels of reserves. We produced 610 million barrels and had additions of 523 million, excluding market factors. So on that basis, our adjusted replacement ratio was 86%. However, because our portfolio is dominated by tax and royalty regimes, there were significant price-related reserve impacts in 2015. 
The lower price effect reduced our year-end reserves by 353 million BOE. In addition, also due to lower prices, we've reduced our expected capital program for the next several years. This slower pace of development has resulted in the booked reserve reduction of 111 million BOE. Now these combined 600 -- 464 million barrels have not gone away because prices have dropped, so we expect to rebook reserves as prices improve.
Adjusting our additions for the price effect on the planned capital reductions, we had organic reserve additions of 59 million barrels, which results in an organic reserve replacement ratio of 10% of 2015 production. Reserves were further reduced by 175 million BOE, primarily as a result of non-core asset dispositions. So our total reserve replacement ratio, including both dispositions and market factors, was negative 19%. As I said, more details will be available in our 10-K filing.
Now I'll cover our operational priorities for the year on the next slide. The midpoint of our 2016 production range is expected to be essentially flat to 2015 production when you adjust out the full year effects of asset sales. In the first quarter, production is expected to be between 1,540 and 1,580 MBOE per day. Production will be lower in the second and third quarters as we see our usual downtime for major turnarounds. And then in the fourth quarter as we move out of turnaround season, we'll see increased production associated with major project ramps in places like Surmont 2 and APLNG and the production associated with development activity across the globe. 
In Alaska, we're still progressing our GMT1 project and our winter exploration program around the existing infrastructure. In the Lower 48, we'll be focused on assessing the results of multiple pilot tests we conducted in 2015. This will allow us to optimize development plans as we prepare for a future ramp-up as our price outlook improves. We also expect to complete our Gulf of Mexico exploration programs before year-end.
In Canada, ramp-up continues at Surmont 2 and we have 2 exploration wells being drilled offshore in Nova Scotia. In our Europe and North Africa segment, we'll continue development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk Area, and we expect first production from Alder in the second half of the year. At APLNG, we're now shipping LNG from Train 1. We've shipped 4 cargoes already and the plant is running well. We also expect the stack-up of Train 2 in the second half of the year. Finally, in Other International, the second well on our offshore Senegal SNE discovery had very encouraging test rates. We've just finished drilling the third well and are currently preparing to test.
It looks like 2016 may be an even more challenging year for the industry than we experienced in 2015. But we remain focused on what we can control, delivering best-in-class operational and safety performance, and we are ready to ramp up the development of our diverse, flexible, low cost of supply resource base when prices recover. Now I'll turn the call back to Ryan to wrap up."

This -- the world has changed and been a dramatic drop in prices, so we're seeing and enduring a much lower drop in prices. And as we look at the fundamentals, it looks like balancing, probably shifting to later in 2016 and possibly moving into 2017. So really it was the depth of the drop over the last 8 weeks to 2 months, combined with the duration. And the inventory doesn't seem to be flattening, let alone starting to drop off. And that, combined with the last month of conversations that we've been having with the rating agencies. And clearly, the debt capacity is going to be reduced. So when we came out with our operating plan in December, we talked about using the balance sheet to get through the cycle. And now the capacity is reduced, the cycle has deepened and potentially gotten longer. So we have to prepare for that. And we made the difficult decision of preserving the balance sheet over the dividend that time. You asked about mid-cycle price. That's a tough one. It looks like it's going to be longer to get there, and there's some downsides, some upsides to that conversation. The downside, the supply has certainly been more resilient than most people expected and we're still building inventory. Certainly, OPEC for now is protecting price or not protecting price and doing that, so they're protecting market share. I think we've seen the resiliency in the unconventional revolutions. It's opened up a new supply source that is more flexible, lower cost of supply than some of the other conventional production like deepwater. And certainly some concerns about economic growth. So those are kind of the things to the downside that would suggest a lower mid-cycle price, but there's other factors. Certainly, the capital cuts that the industry is making should result in a supply rebound or a supply shock to the downside. And certainly, the Saudis could lead OPEC to a different decision whenever they feel like the point they're trying to make has been made. And certainly, the lower prices are stimulating demand. So there's pieces on both sides of this thing that balance out the concern about where mid-cycles might be going to. In the past, we've had a view of mid-cycle prices in the mid-$70s but we're currently taking a look at that."

We've got development capital program of just over $2 billion, $2.2 billion. And despite the cuts that we're doing in the Lower 48, there's still the $800 million of that going into North America and -- as we ramp down our rig program. And then we have, as you mentioned, an exploration program going on as quite significant deepwater component next year as we finish our deepwater program. That's a total of $1.2 billion. So we're going to be looking to execute all of that at lower cost and execute all that scope at lower cost.

I think, what is target leverage you target credit rating, particularly in the credit rating side, it's kind of hard to answer any kind of thought about a target credit rating agencies because the rating agencies are going a lot through quite a change on how they assess the industry. We don't know what, really, right now what debt levels are going to correlate to what credit ratings. So I think the direction of your question is right, it's just how do we think about the level of our debt going forward. And just some general comments about debt. If you think about what we've done over the last several years, we ended 2015 with $24.9 billion, so essentially $25 billion for the debt. And 3 years ago, at 2012, we had $22 billion worth of debt. So unlike some of the peers that -- in our company, we've not really added a significant amount of debt in the last several years, and really what we've been doing as we've been an independent E&P, as we funded our capital program and our dividends mostly from cash from operations and selling noncore assets. And then we quickly made adjustments to our capital program and our operating cost structure as the circumstances have changed trying to limit our debt borrowing. So that's history. So -- but going forward how do we think about the question of the right level of debt and what makes sense at different mid-cycle prices, so last year, we generated $7.5 billion of cash flow in kind of what was a $50-ish price environment. 2014, the year before that, we generated $16 billion of cash flow in what was kind of a $90 price environment. And you can think the mid-cycle price is going to be somewhere in that range between $50 and $90 but it would -- we can look at $25 billion of debt, though, and feel like that's a reasonable amount of debt to have in either of those kind of mid-cycle scenarios. So consequently, as prices improve, we don't feel like we're going to be compelled to use cash flows to reduce debt levels. So delevering is not going to be a priority for us. But we're not comfortable, and this is what you heard from us today, is we're not comfortable with having a plan that relies on the heavy use of debt financing to fund cash shortfalls in a period of really low prices. And that's where we felt like we were going to be if we continued the current dividend, that we'd be rapidly using balance sheet capacity while we are waiting on some kind of commodity price improvement."

And then on the demand side, like everybody, we're following China and the growing markets around the world and trying to see what the economic impact is going to be. The fourth quarter GDP in the U.S. was quite low, largely driven by lack of investment in the oil and gas industry driving some of that.

I'm going to let Jeff handle the 2015 recap in his upcoming comments, and I want to jump right into the news we announced today beginning with Slide 4.
With today's announcement regarding reductions in our operating plan and our dividend, we have taken significant actions to reset the company in response to much lower commodity prices and tightening credit markets across the industry. These are 2 factors that we have -- that have changed significantly in our view in a short period of time, and they have important implications for the sector, especially in 2016 and '17. 
Regarding prices, there are 3 factors that are driving our actions. First, current prices are much lower than we expected at the time we announced our 2016 operating plan. This is amid bearish supply-demand signals and record levels of inventories. Brent is currently trading 40% lower than 2015 average prices. 
Second, we believe this downturn could last a while longer. Just a few months ago, we thought the market would rebalance by the second half of 2016. Now it looks like that could stretch into 2017. 
And third, greater concerns about global growth suggests it could take longer to reach an equilibrium mid-cycle price after balancing occurs. Now certainly there's a lot of debate about these factors but we can't bet on prices turning quickly. Instead, we're taking what we believe are prudent actions to prepare for a weaker price environment and for a longer period of time.
Regarding the credit markets, it's no secret that the credit rating agencies also see a likelihood of a weaker, more protracted downturn. Recently, Moody's and S&P have issued significantly lower price decks. The agencies have industry under review for credit rating downgrades. Moody's has stated that multi-notch rating downgrades are likely and some have already occurred. The consequences of these downgrades are that debt capacity will shrink across the sector. 
For ConocoPhillips, the bottom line is this: we're going to take actions to maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe this is critical and will be a key differentiator in this business. So as difficult as these choices are, and they were very difficult, we must do the right thing for the company. 
As we announced, we're taking 2 key actions to respond to these factors. First, we are further reducing our 2016 operating plan capital and operating expense. Now for the past 18 months, we've lowered CapEx and OpEx levels across the company as prices have weakened, and we're doing it again in 2016. And that's shown on Slide 5. 
This slide summarizes our revised 2016 operating plan. It represents a significant shift compared to last year and an even bigger shift compared to 2014. Now importantly, these reductions we're making will improve net cash flow in 2016 by $2 billion compared to the plan we laid out in December. 
On the left side of this chart, you can see we're lowering our 2016 capital expenditures to $6.4 billion. That's a reduction of $3.7 billion compared with 2015 and $1.3 billion compared to our original 2016 operating plan. We're dropping down to 3 rigs in the Lower 48 because it doesn't make economic sense to maintain our regional level of activity at current prices, and we don't lose acreage or optionality. We're cutting other discretionary programs across the business, which are somewhat offset by anticipated cash calls in our equity affiliates.
Our original plan anticipated 1% to 3% production growth in 2016. Now we expect flat production, given these capital cuts. We're letting Lower 48 volumes decline but these will be offset in the near term from ramp-up at APLNG and in the oil sands.
Finally, we continue to improve our operating costs. We set an initial budget of $7.7 billion for 2016. We're now lowering that to $7 billion. But we don't believe these reductions are sufficient to maintain our strong balance sheet under the lower for longer circumstances I just described. And so we've taken a second and more difficult step of reducing the dividend. This morning, we announced reducing the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share effective with the first quarter 2016 dividend payment and this was discussed on Slide 6.
In mid-December, we reaffirmed that our dividend is the top priority use of cash. In 2016, this was premised on using up to a couple billion dollars of balance sheet capacity based on similar prices to 2015. After making those adjustments to our operating plan that I just reviewed, we analyzed the impact to our balance sheet under conditions where prices stay in the $30s for longer. We came to the conclusion that our balance sheet could get stretched beyond a prudent level. 
Ultimately, we believe we needed to make a tough choice between protecting the current level of the dividend or maintaining our strong balance sheet through an extended downturn. We made the decision to reduce the dividend. This action, combined with the operating plan reductions, will improve net cash flow by about $4.4 billion in 2016. 
Once we made that decision, our primary consideration was to set a dividend that will be sustainable through the cycles. We are balancing several objectives, including yield, financial strength and lowering the breakeven cost of our business. We set the dividend at a level that we believe results in a competitive yield. 
The dividend will continue to be a top priority. It provides important discipline on our investment programs and will remain a core part of our offering. We believe our dividend is at a level that preserves balance sheet strength and provides financial flexibility through the current downturn. These actions also lower our breakeven price to roughly $45 per barrel Brent. And what we mean here is that we can keep production flat and pay our dividend for many years at $45 per barrel without needing to sell assets or increase our debt levels. 
This significant improvement in our breakeven price will allow us to generate greater profitability and cash flow growth when the cycle turns. And the combined reset of capital, operating cost and the dividend will enable us to generate free cash flow that we can deploy across a range of choices, including increased investment into our low cost of supply resource base but also including returning capital to shareholders. The reset will allow us to grow our dividend in the future as our cash flows grow and at a much lower mid-cycle price.
Now it goes without saying that these were very difficult actions to take. But they will improve our ability to manage through the price weakness the industry is facing. They will improve our medium-term outlook by allowing us to accelerate performance as prices turn. And they will help the long-term performance of the business by making us more resilient in a world of lower, more volatile prices. 
So now let me turn it over to Jeff and Matt and I'll come back at the end to conclude my remarks."

And as Ryan said, I'll open with some brief comments about 2015, the summary of which are shown on this page. Measured against the standard of delivering the things within our control, it was a strong year. Strategically, we lowered our capital expenditures by more than 40% compared to 2014. We achieved $2.2 billion in disposition proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, primarily North American gas assets, and announced our intention to begin a phased exit of deepwater exploration. 
Operationally, we achieved 5% year-over-year production growth, excluding Libya and downtime and dispositions. That exceeded our initial guidance for the year and came mostly from the development drilling programs and a ramp-up of production from our major projects. We also achieved first production from Surmont 2 and first LNG from APLNG, which are big milestones for the company.
Financially, we have an adjusted net loss of $1.7 billion or $1.40 per share. This includes a fourth quarter adjusted net loss of $1.1 billion or $0.90 a share. We recognize that analyst consensus was a negative 64% -- $0.64 per share, and we believe this difference primarily reflects the $506 million of dry hole expense in the quarter in our adjusted earnings, which we think is about 15% -- $0.15 higher than consensus estimates. FX impacts accounts for the balance of this difference.
Finally, we had $7.6 billion in cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, and ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I'll now walk through our cash flow waterfall on Slide 9. On this chart, you can see the major buckets of cash sources and uses for the year. We started the year with $5.1 billion in cash and generated $7.6 billion from operating activities, excluding working capital. Working capital was about $1 billion use of cash during the year.
We captured about $2.2 billion of net proceeds from dispositions and took on about $2.4 billion of debt. Our 2015 capital expenditures were $10.1 billion. And after accounting for dividends and some other items, we ended the year with $2.4 billion in cash.
Turning to Slide 10. I'll cover some thoughts on the balance sheet. A period of low prices highlights the importance of a strong balance sheet in the cyclical business. However, a consequence of the recent price drops has been that credit rating agencies have become very pessimistic about future prices and they are currently reviewing the industry's credit ratings using much lower forecasted prices. 
We should see industry-wide credit downgrades over the next couple of months, with a potential for multi-notch downgrades in some cases. Across the industry, this is going to result in reduced debt capacity within given rating bands compared to just a few months ago. We believe the reduction in the dividend and the substantially lower risk of significant borrowings as a result of that decision will help mitigate the credit rating impacts.
We are well positioned should we need to acquire additional debt capital. We ended 2015 with over $8 billion in liquidity comprised of $2.4 billion in cash and about $6 billion of available debt capacity on our revolving credit facilities. We expect to see significant levels of borrowings among our peer companies this year. And our liquidity balance will give us the flexibility to access the capital markets at the time of our choosing and avoid a very crowded energy market for energy sector debt this year.
In terms of how much debt we will need to raise in 2016, our current estimate is that we will utilize our cash balances and not need significant additional debt if oil prices average around $40 for the year. 
By making the difficult decision to reduce our dividends, we believe we are positioned to preserve a strong balance sheet in a prolonged period of low prices such as the ones we're seeing today. While we have been successful over the last several years in selling assets at full value, during a period of higher prices and strong demand for assets, another important benefit of making the changes we announced this morning and maintaining balance sheet capacity is that asset sales are not necessary to bridge funding gaps.
That concludes my comments. Note that our appendix includes some updated net income sensitivities and some additional 2016 guidance items. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for his operational comments."

Final reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February but we don't expect these numbers to change significantly. On Slide 12, you'll see that we start",605,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll review our operational performance beginning with our 2015 reserves. Final reserve details will be published in our 10-K in late February but we don't expect these numbers to change significantly. 
On Slide 12, you'll see that we started the year with 8.9 billion barrels of reserves. We produced 610 million barrels and had additions of 523 million, excluding market factors. So on that basis, our adjusted replacement ratio was 86%. However, because our portfolio is dominated by tax and royalty regimes, there were significant price-related reserve impacts in 2015. 
The lower price effect reduced our year-end reserves by 353 million BOE. In addition, also due to lower prices, we've reduced our expected capital program for the next several years. This slower pace of development has resulted in the booked reserve reduction of 111 million BOE. Now these combined 600 -- 464 million barrels have not gone away because prices have dropped, so we expect to rebook reserves as prices improve.
Adjusting our additions for the price effect and the planned capital reductions, we had organic reserve additions of 59 million barrels, which results in an organic reserve replacement ratio of 10% of 2015 production. Reserves were further reduced by 175 million BOE, primarily as a result of non-core asset dispositions. So our total reserve replacement ratio, including both dispositions and market factors, was negative 19%. As I said, more details will be available in our 10-K filing.
Now I'll cover our operational priorities for the year on the next slide. The midpoint of our 2016 production range is expected to be essentially flat to 2015 production when you adjust out the full year effects of asset sales. In the first quarter, production is expected to be between 1,540 and 1,580 MBOE per day. Production will be lower in the second and third quarters as we see our usual downtime for major turnarounds. And then in the fourth quarter as we move out of turnaround season, we'll see increased production associated with major project ramps in places like Surmont 2 and APLNG and the production associated with development activity across the globe. 
In Alaska, we're still progressing our GMT1 project and our winter exploration program around the existing infrastructure. In the Lower 48, we'll be focused on assessing the results of multiple pilot tests we conducted in 2015. This will allow us to optimize development plans as we prepare for a future ramp-up as our price outlook improves. We also expect to complete our Gulf of Mexico exploration programs before year-end.
In Canada, ramp-up continues at Surmont 2 and we have 2 exploration wells being drilled offshore in Nova Scotia. In our Europe and North Africa segment, we'll continue development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk Area, and we expect first production from Alder in the second half of the year. At APLNG, we're now shipping LNG from Train 1. We've shipped 4 cargoes already and the plant is running well. We also expect the stack-up of Train 2 in the second half of the year. Finally, in Other International, the second well on our offshore Senegal SNE discovery had very encouraging test rates. We've just finished drilling the third well and are currently preparing to test.
It looks like 2016 may be an even more challenging year for the industry than we experienced in 2015. But we remain focused on what we can control, delivering best-in-class operational and safety performance, and we are ready to ramp up the development of our diverse, flexible, low cost of supply resource base when prices recover. Now I'll turn the call back to Ryan to wrap up."

This -- the world has changed and been a dramatic drop in prices, so we're seeing and enduring a much lower drop in prices. And as we look at the fundamentals, it looks like balancing probably is shifting to later in 2016 and possibly moving into 2017. So really it was the depth of the drop over the last 8 weeks to 2 months, combined with the duration. And the inventory doesn't seem to be flattening, let alone starting to drop off. And that, combined with the last month of conversations that we've been having with the rating agencies. And clearly, the debt capacity is going to be reduced. So when we came out with our operating plan in December, we talked about using the balance sheet to get through the cycle. And now the capacity is reduced, the cycle has deepened and potentially gotten longer. So we have to prepare for that. And we made the difficult decision of preserving the balance sheet over the dividend that time. You asked about mid-cycle price. That's a tough one. It looks like it's going to be longer to get there, and there's some downsides and some upsides to that conversation. The downside, the supply has certainly been more resilient than most people expected and we're still building inventory. Certainly, OPEC for now is protecting price -- or not protecting price and doing that, so they're protecting market share. I think we've seen the resiliency in the unconventional revolutions. It's opened up a new supply source that is more flexible, lower cost of supply than some of the other conventional production like deepwater and certainly some concerns about economic growth. So those are kind of the things to the downside that would suggest a lower mid-cycle price, but there's other factors. Certainly, the capital cuts that the industry is making should result in a supply rebound or a supply shock to the downside. And certainly, the Saudis could lead OPEC to a different decision whenever they feel like the point they're trying to make has been made. And certainly, the lower prices are stimulating demand. So there's pieces on both sides of this thing that balance out the concern about where mid-cycles might be going to. In the past, we've had a view of mid-cycle prices in the mid-$70s but we're currently taking a look at that."

We're hitting the reset button here a little bit and I can understand that. And it was a gut-wrenching decision for us to go do that.

There's about $300 million going into Clair Ridge to move that towards completion, and about the same going into Malakai in Malaysia. So these are projects that are getting very close to completion. We've got development capital program of just over $2 billion, $2.2 billion. And despite the cuts that we're doing in the Lower 48, there's still the $800 million of that going into North America and -- as we ramp down our rig program. And then we have, as you mentioned, an exploration program going on as quite significant deepwater component next year as we finalize -- finish our deepwater program. That's a total of $1.2 billion. So we're going to be looking to execute all of that at lower cost and execute all that scope at lower cost.

And that is one, we want to do continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and minimize the borrowing in 2016, which would lead you in one direction. We certainly had what sort of long-term breakeven price do we think is appropriate and provides for a good value proposition going forward. So that's factored into it. And certainly, the desire to keep a competitive dividend as measured by yield or other kinds of factors. So it was really a triangulation around -- of all those things. And then factoring into that is our capital program and the commitments that Matt talked about and the capital spend that we need to have that we think makes sense for the long-term value of the company. So there were those pieces that put us in that box, trying to decide and triangulate a bit on what the right level of dividend going forward should be for the company."

I think, what is target leverage you target credit rating, particularly in the credit rating side, it's kind of hard to answer any kind of thought about a target credit rating agency because the rating agencies are going a lot through quite a change on how they assess the industry. We don't know what, really, right now what debt levels are going to correlate to what credit ratings. So I think the direction of your question is right, it's just how do we think about the level of our debt going forward. And just some general comments about debt. If you think about what we've done over the last several years, we ended 2015 with $24.9 billion, so essentially $25 billion for the debt. And 3 years ago, at 2012, we had $22 billion worth of debt. So unlike some of the peers that -- in our company, we've not really added a significant amount of debt in the last several years, and really what we've been doing as we've been an independent E&P, is we funded our capital program and our dividends mostly from cash from operations and selling noncore assets. And then we quickly made adjustments to our capital program and our operating cost structure as the circumstances have changed trying to limit our debt borrowing. So that's history. So -- but going forward how do we think about the question of the right level of debt and what makes sense at different mid-cycle prices, so last year, we generated $7.5 billion of cash flow in kind of what was a $50-ish price environment. 2014, the year before that, we generated $16 billion of cash flow in what was kind of a $90 price environment. And you can think the mid-cycle price is going to be somewhere in that range between $50 and $90 but it would -- we can look at $25 billion of debt, though, and feel like that's a reasonable amount of debt to have in either of those kind of mid-cycle scenarios. So consequently, as prices improve, we don't feel like we're going to be compelled to use cash flows to reduce debt levels. So delevering is not going to be a priority for us. But we're not comfortable, and this is what you heard from us today, is we're not comfortable with having a plan that relies on the heavy use of debt financing to fund cash shortfalls in a period of really low prices. And that's where we felt like we were going to be if we continued the current dividend, that we'd be rapidly using balance sheet capacity while we are waiting on some kind of commodity price improvement."

And two, is that the prudent thing to do? But we do have some assets on the market. They're ones sort of around the fringes of our noncore. They're typically in areas that aren't near the gas or North American gas that haven't been subjected to the recent price downturn on the oil side. And so you ought to still expect a little bit of disposition this year, probably less than what we had last year. But we're still marketing our deepwater assets. We have some assets in Indonesia and in Alaska and we're still moving those forward. But I think the point Jeff was trying to make is if you're counting on generating multi-billion dollars of proceeds from an asset sale to bridge some cash flow gap at these lower commodity prices, we just don't think that's smart to rely on."

And then on the demand side, like everybody, we're following China and the growing markets around the world and trying to see what the economic impact is going to be. The fourth quarter GDP in the U.S. was quite low, largely driven by lack of investment in the oil and gas industry driving some of that.

It looks like about a $5 difference in oil is how you covered the dividend, if I assume net income is a good proxy for cash flow.

So that's one point. The other point we're making, as we look longer term at the company more of a steady-state is with the changes we're making in a $45 Brent environment, we're going to be able to have enough capital to keep flat production kind of around the $5.5 billion that Matt referenced earlier and cover our dividend and not have any borrowings, not have any use of cash, not any have asset sales come into that.

I think it's important for investors to know how we're thinking about the current environment but also how we have positioned the company for strong performance when prices recover. 
So if you please turn to Slide 4, we'll get started. We believe that our value proposition lies in the combination of our unique portfolio attributes and our capital allocation principles. Let me start with the left side of this slide. Underlying our value proposition is a portfolio that we think is quite unique among E&Ps. We've listed several attributes that distinguish or asset base. We have a diverse, relatively low decline base of production. We expect our decline rate to moderate somewhat over the next few years as we bring on additional tranches of low to no decline oil sands and LNG projects. Growth will come from investments in our large low cost of supply resource base. 
We continue to analyze and calibrate this resource base as we believe it holds profitable investment inventory to keep production or grow modestly -- keep flat production or grow modestly for well over a decade. Within this captured resource base, we have a mix of flexible short cycle projects and lower risk medium cycle investment projects. We see a role for both of these types of assets in our portfolio. And finally, the key to being successful in a cyclical business is to have a sustained low cost structure.
Now on the right side of this slide are the capital allocation principles that describe our value proposition. Conceptually, the principles are similar to the ones we had at the time of the spin, namely give cash back to shareholders, maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet and exercise disciplined growth. Obviously, these elements have been reset but this is still how we expect to deliver returns to the shareholders. 
Now let me go through these principles. We reset the dividend but we still intend to return a meaningful portion of our cash back to our shareholders through a cash dividend. In February, we set the dividend at a level that we believe can be sustained through the price cycles, but that also results in a competitive yield compared to the broad market as well as to E&Ps. 
The dividend will remain a core part of our offering, and we are targeting annual real growth in that dividend going forward. We remain committed to have a strong investment-grade balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of a strong balance sheet. We have set a target to get our debt to less than $25 billion. The pace of that debt reduction will depend on prices and asset sales progress. But delevering is a top priority as we come out of the downturn. 
We have positioned the company to compete on financial returns, so despite having a large low cost of supply portfolio, we won't grow for growth's sake. We'll continue to be very disciplined about how we allocate our growth capital. We're in a strong position to do that as we come to the end of a significant major project investment phase. 
You'll notice that we're stating that our growth could be on an absolute or a per share basis. Again, financial returns are at the core of our value proposition. If we get the returns right, the rest will follow, and we're committed to getting the returns right. 
So the way we think about creating value through the cycles is to have clear principles that align with a competitive portfolio to generate strong returns for the shareholders. One without the other is not sufficient and we believe we have both. 
We believe we have a sound value proposition but what also matters is how we are executing our value proposition for the short, medium and long term. And it's important to be disciplined across all 3 time horizons, especially coming out of this price downturn. 
Now I'll cover this on the next slide. First, the short term. For us, it's all about defending against low prices in 2016 and '17. In the first quarter, we raised $4.6 billion of low-cost debt. We announced this morning that we're further cutting 2016 capital from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion. 
We reset the dividend for the lower end of the price cycle. We have strong liquidity, including about $5 billion of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. We think we took the right short-term steps to protect against some extended period of weak prices. At the same time, we're staying disciplined and continuing to safely execute our operating plan, and Al will provide more details about that in a moment, but we're running well and our key projects are on track. Finally, we're focused on lowering the breakeven cost of the business. 
Now for perspective, if we were in a steady-state world of sustained $45 per barrel oil prices, we believe we could cover the capital required to maintain flat production and pay our dividend with cash from operations. Now this steady state for us comes after completion of our major projects and a reallocation of capital to our low cost of supply conventional and unconventional portfolio.
This positions us to accelerate performance as prices improve in the medium term. Debt reduction will be a priority and we'll target growing the dividend on a real annual basis. We remain focused on safely executing the business. We'll complete several major projects in the medium term that will ramp up production for most projects. Finally, when prices start to recover, it'll be important to stay diligent on our cost efforts.
Our long-term goal is to execute predictable performance in a world of lower more volatile prices. We can do this by achieving our target debt level and striving to maintain cash flow neutrality. Now we define cash flow neutrality as CapEx for flat production plus our dividend equals cash from operations. As we generate cash in excess of cash flow neutrality, we have choices about how to allocate those funds. We can return cash to shareholders through share repurchases or we could fund more investments in our low cost of supply resource base. Growth CapEx will compete with distributions to shareholders. That means we're not setting a target for absolute growth because we're willing to grow on a per share basis if that makes more sense. 
We'll continue to high-grade the portfolio and those proceeds will be allocated to debt reduction, distributions and CapEx. We could also choose to keep additional cash on hand, especially if we thought another low price cycle was approaching. The decisions on how we allocate the cash flows will be based on staying disciplined, achieving the best returns and maximizing value for shareholders.
Now certainly, the last 18 months have really brought home some fundamentals for how to thrive in a cyclical business. We believe it's essential to have a high degree of capital flexibility, a low cost of supply portfolio, best-in-class cost structure and a strong balance sheet. Most of all, you have to be disciplined. The way to win in a cyclical business is to have a low cost of supply portfolio and to be the most resilient when prices are low and the most disciplined when prices are high. 
I hope these comments were helpful, but on Slide 6, I'll summarize the results for the quarter. So left column recaps the strategic actions that I've just described. The middle column captures our operational highlights, and Al will discuss those in a bit more detail. We met our goals and our important capital programs are impressed -- are progressing well. 
The right column summarizes the financial results for the quarter and there's no getting around it. It was a very weak quarter financially. Underlying performance on the things we can control like operating costs was strong, but the bottom line was a large adjusted net loss that clearly reflected the weak commodity price environment. So now let me to turn the call over to Don for a few comments on our financial results."
296527,330355155,965924,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Ryan. I'll start with our first quarter adjusted earnings on Slide 8. As Ryan mentioned, we had a strong quarter operationally but low commodity prices continued to dominate the quarter's financial results. We reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2",541,"Thanks, Ryan. I'll start with our first quarter adjusted earnings on Slide 8. As Ryan mentioned, we had a strong quarter operationally but low commodity prices continued to dominate the quarter's financial results. We reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion or $0.95 per share, with realized prices down 20% sequentially and 38% year-over-year. 
First quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide. Our segment adjusted earnings are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail. 
The only notable item to call out this quarter is in the Lower 48, where earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million as a result of a dry hole at the Melmar prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. 
A couple of other items of note. While we have lowered capital guidance, we are not changing any other guidance items at this time. This includes operating expense, which ran light to expectations in this quarter. We expect to give you an update at midyear. Also, we've updated our sensitivities in the appendix of this deck. We changed Henry Hub to reflect the impact of last year's asset sales and WTI to reflect production decline in the Lower 48 due to reduced drilling activity.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll cover production. First quarter production averaged 1.578 million BOE per day, which was the upper end of guidance, reflecting increased ramp at APLNG and better performance across the portfolio. Last year's first quarter volumes were 1.61 million BOE per day, but after adjusting for dispositions, first quarter 2015 volumes would be 1.54 million BOE per day. As a reminder, the majority of those dispositions were natural gas properties. So as a result, North American gas represents only 19% of our overall production this quarter compared to 24% in the year-ago period.
Continuing through the waterfall and netting out the differences in down time, we saw an underlying increase of 34,000 BOE per day or 2%. That increase came primarily from APLNG gas and Canadian bitumen, partly offset by a decline in North American gas. This gets you to 1.578 million BOE per day of production for the quarter, so underlying performance is strong.
If you turn to Slide 10, I'll cover the cash flows during the quarter. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and generated $700 million from operating activities, excluding working capital. Working capital was an offset of about $400 million in the first quarter, but we expect it to be a wash for the full year. 
During the quarter, we received about $100 million of net proceeds from dispositions. Net debt increased by $4.5 billion, and capital spending for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which we expect to be the high watermark for the year. After dividend payments of $300 million, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
It was a tough quarter financially, but we ended the quarter with a significant amount of cash on hand and strong liquidity to manage through the price environment. We can't do much about prices but the key is to continue executing the business well and we're doing that as you'll now hear from Al."
296527,330355155,965924,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief update on each of our operating segments and then we can move on to your questions. I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments on Slide 12. In the Lower 48, our production in the first quarter was 491,000 barrels",941,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief update on each of our operating segments and then we can move on to your questions. I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments on Slide 12. 
In the Lower 48, our production in the first quarter was 491,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's down 15,000 barrels per day or 3% compared to our first quarter production last year once you adjust for asset sales. The reduction is primarily due to our reduced rig count last year, which is impacting our production this year. 
We further exercised our capital flexibility in the Lower 48 and dropped down to 3 operated rigs in April, and we plan to stay at that level through 2016. Now that said, even with the lower rig count, we're continuing to realize strong efficiencies in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and we'll keep leveraging technology and working with our vendors to improve performance and capture deflation where possible. 
In exploration, the non-operated Gibson well is currently drilling. However, that's the last exploration well that we plan to drill in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In this price environment, we don't feel it's prudent to continue allocating capital to new deepwater prospects, so we no longer plan to drill or Socorro, which we had planned to drill with the Maersk drill ship. By the way, these changes account for about half of our 2016 capital reduction from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion that Ryan referred to earlier.
Looking at Canada, our production was 293,000 barrels per day. That's an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2015 production of 288,000 after adjusting for dispositions. The increase is driven mostly by improved well performance in Western Canada and ramp-up at Surmont 2. In the past year, we've increased our bitumen production by 6% and reduced underlying gas production by 3%. But when you include asset sales, gas is down 23% so we've significantly changed our production mix in Canada.
So moving over to Slide 13, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. These regions have many of our legacy assets that still compete for capital. As you can see, the low cost of supply projects we brought online over the last couple of years are beginning to offset natural declines. 
In Alaska, we're seeing favorable results from our CD5 and Drill Site 2S projects, which both started up in the fourth quarter of last year and are contributing to a 3% production increase over the first quarter of 2015. We also just approved an additional phase at CD5, which will bring more wells online in late 2017. We're starting activity at GMT1, which was sanctioned at the end of 2015 and is expected to come online in late 2018. 
In Europe, production is also up 3% versus the first quarter of 2015, and we have several more projects underway, which are expected to start up over the next couple of years. In late 2015, we successfully took over operatorship at Britannia, which was previously operated by a joint venture. We're seeing cost savings from this action and is a good example of efficiency improvements that we've been able to implement.
Slide 14 covers our last 2 segments: Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International. In APME, production is up 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 10% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the ramp-up at APLNG. Train 1 is running well and ramped up more quickly than anticipated, with 11 cargoes loaded in the first quarter. And as of earlier this week, we've actually now loaded 15 cargoes at APLNG. 
In Malaysia, we're ramping up at Gumusut after starting up the gas and water injection, and we're continuing to progress the Malikai project, which should start producing next year. 
As the Other International segment is exploration-focused, the main news for the quarter is from Senegal, where we completed several successful appraisal wells and drill tests to further evaluate this new play opening discovery. 
So Ryan started the call with details of our value proposition and strategy, and then Don covered the financial results. If you'll turn to Slide 15, I'll wrap up with our operational outlook for the year. While we continue to focus on lowering capital and reducing costs, we're committed to safely delivering on our operational commitments. As we previously guided, we expect our 2016 production to be essentially flat to 2015 when you exclude the full year effects of asset sales. This result is driven by some decline in the Lower 48 unconventionals as we continue to exercise our capital flexibility there, offset by growth in the other segments. 
In the second quarter, production is expected to be between 1.5 million and 1.54 million barrels per day. The reduction from first quarter is the result of major turnaround activity we have planned primarily in Europe. Turnaround activity will continue into the third quarter mostly in Europe and Alaska. By the fourth quarter, we expect production to increase as our major turnarounds are completed. 
We're continuing to ramp up at Surmont 2 in Canada and have ongoing project developments in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific that will also add to production. Finally, in Australia, we expect to deliver the first cargo from APLNG Train 2 in the fourth quarter of this year. 
So the price environment continues to be challenging, but as always, we'll continue to focus on the things we can control, delivering best-in-class safety performance, bringing our projects online on time and on budget and meeting or exceeding our operating targets. So now I'll turn the call over for Q&A."

We'll be looking at the entire macro environment, looking at supply and demand fundamentals of whether we think that any price action that we get is actually sustainable or not. And then as prices do come back, our first priority is going to be to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce our debt. And then even after that, we recognize that adding capital for organic growth is going to have to compete with other things on our list like, for example, per share growth. So we're not in a hurry to say there's some price trigger where we're going to add back capital."

And then our unconventional investments, which I think was more the point of your question around Eagle Ford and the Bakken, while they could have a gross wide range of cost of supply, if you're in the best like we are and the positions that we are, those cost of supplies are very competitive with anything that we've got or any non-OPEC kind of investments that you referred to around the world today. So we'll talk a bit more about that in the analyst meeting that Ellen referred to coming up to show you even within our portfolio, there's a range of cost of supplies around each asset, but we're getting to the place where we understand that very well so we can make sure that we're very disciplined in terms of how we allocate the capital to the highest-returning lowest cost of supply assets in the portfolio."

So we'll be targeting some of those annual returns to the shareholders through the dividend channel and also reducing the debt as we come out of an area where we're generating free cash or we've reached that point of cash flow neutrality that we referred to. Now as we get that free cash and we think about it, we said is we're just going to be really judicious about allocating the capital, make sure that per share growth competes with organic growth that we have in the portfolio.

And as you correctly point out, if you look at the first quarter number, multiply by 4, you get a number that's less than $6.5 billion. So we were on a really good pace in the first quarter. Our operating and our technical teams and our supply chain folks have really been successful at driving out cost. And the focus in all that work, as were kind of hinting at, has been on sustainability, find sustainable reduction, structural reductions while also capturing as much of the cyclical as we can even though we know we'll have to give some of that back at the end of the day. So frankly, I do expect to beat $7 billion this year. But we've got these turnaround season coming. There's also the and Socorro decision.

First, on supply chain, let me just mention our overall progress there. We talked at our Analyst Day a year ago about trying to get $1 billion of -- that's both CapEx and OpEx of supply chain savings. And we did achieve just a little over that in 2015 of deflation savings, CapEx and OpEx from our supply chain. And then we set a target for ourselves for this year to get another $1 billion. And so far, we're on track to that. If you look at actually captured deflation savings in 2016 for us in the first quarter, it was $300 million. That's CapEx and OpEx. So we're on track there. And in fact, we're starting to think about our window of opportunity for locking in some of these prices for longer periods of time going forward as we think about what our cost structure is going to look like as things start to come back. In terms of the rigs that we need to -- let me just talk about say the rigs we need to hold flat. So we're down to 3 rigs in the Lower 48 right now. We would need to get back up to 12 to 13 rigs, somewhere in that range in order to just get back to holding our production flat, a number higher than that just start growing our production again. We have retained the capability amongst our staff to be able to do that. And so from our internal standpoint, we could do it relatively quickly if that's what we chose to do. From an external standpoint, obviously, there has been a lot both hardware capability and people capability amongst our contracting community. And so I think the first leg of returning some rigs back to work is going to be something that can be done in a fairly short amount of time. But similar to us where we go from 3 to 12 or 13 to hold flat or to go that even bigger number to grow with a whole industry trying to do that at once, I don't think that capacity is going to be there. And so it'll have to be built up over time and I could see that being north of 1 year, 1- to 2-year kind of time frame to really build the kind of capacity back. In other words, I don't think U.S. unconventional production can go back up as fast as it came down or is coming down still."

The added comment to the balance sheet piece is certainly, we'll be watching that in trying to decide. We're setting ourselves up with a lot of capital flexibility in the shorter cycle time projects so it's not just this going to be other ways to manage the cash. And at the end of the day, once we hit free cash flow, we've got a lot of choices about how to allocate that free cash flow, some of which may be keeping cash on the balance sheet and preparing -- so it's about net debt.

If we have inflation and how that inflation comes back in depends on what's happened in the market and the industry, then the nominal number can go up over time. So it's $5 billion to $6 billion under today's conditions or low price conditions. And in a scenario where we're moving back up $60, $70s to $80s in the oil price, that number is going to go up. It's going to reflate. And so we've done some estimates on how much of the cost reduction we've got, we think, structural versus cyclical but certainly there is a significant cyclical component that will come back as you move back up. Now on some of these medium cycle projects, the ones you mentioned, those costs are fairly well locked in already, and so they are not going to change with reflation. The place where it will hit us first is in the unconventional North America just as that was the place where we first captured and most heavily captured deflation. I expect that's where we'll see reflation coming back first. And so I also mentioned a minute ago that one of the things we've been doing to kind out of it is in the first quarter, that's when we started to work on locking in pricing for longer periods of time, particularly in the L48 the unconventional where we give out the right to be able to rebid when we think things are going lower instead lock in the price as things move higher over a longer period of time. Just trying to delay when some of that reflation comes back into our numbers."

I'll take the first part and maybe Al can take the second part there. I think as we go into this analyst meeting, as I tried to say in my opening comments, Paul, I think sort of our disciplined capital approach is still fundamental. We have that at the spin and we'll continue to talk about that. I think the portfolio differentiates itself and as we learn more about the unconventionals more and more, the technology, the work that we've done over the last few years, we just see lower cost of supply and a lot more resilience in that portfolio, so I think the portfolio will continue to evolve and occupy a big piece of what we talked about. And then certainly what's different is, while the dividend decision was difficult, probably the most difficult I've had to make as set the company. So we have I think -- we've lowered the breakeven for the company we start to generate free cash flow, which is something we didn't have sort of at the spin as we came out of that. To was going to take until these major produce, and we got through these long cycle time projects to get up and running before we reached that condition. That was the case post-spin, and that's even more so the case now and I think what's different now is that the deeper and a better understanding of the low cost of supply that sits in the portfolio. It was captured which have informed our deepwater decision as well here about a year ago, which was a tough one at the time, looks better today obviously but certainly a tougher one at the time. But it's been informed by what -- as we've interrogated the portfolio and applied technology to that, what we can do with the existing captured resource base and the kind of growth we can see flat capital for a decade or more just by exercising the options we have in the captured portfolio."

That's one of the things that's driven our thinking around deepwater is that you haven't been able to drive -- that cost of supply hasn't -- the structural part of it has been a bit more difficult to drive it down versus say unconventional. Now with regard to your question on how industry comes back in the U.S. on the unconventional side, I don't think we're going to be the only ones thinking that we want to do some debt reduction before we go back to running rigs. So I expect that, that, along with some of the effects we were talking about earlier, will cause things not to come back up at the same speed that they came down. And of course, there will be that delay effect as well just as we have the way down you will have that on the way up. I already mentioned some of the things we're doing on the supply chain side to try to manage our cost on the way up. But I will say, we talked earlier, as we get to a free cash flow position and we're judging whether we want to put somebody to organic growth versus per share growth versus other uses of that capital, one of the things we'll be looking at is what the cost is doing. If costs are reflating all the way back to where they were before, then our interest in putting that money back to work and that kind of work is going to be lower. So we are going to be disciplined in managing those costs and the pace that we go back to work partly depend the attractiveness of that were partly depend on how that reflation works."

Before I jump into the quarterly results, I want to make some general comments about the company and the environment that we find ourselves in today.

Before I jump into the quarterly results, I want to make some general comments about the company and the environment that we find ourselves in today. On the next couple of slides, I'll address how ConocoPhillips is positioning to create value as an independent E&P company. I'll describe our value proposition and how we'll compete in a world of lower mid-cycle and more volatile prices. I'll also describe how we are prioritizing our business activities in the short term, the medium term and the long term. I think it's important for investors to know how we're thinking about the current environment but also how we have positioned the company for strong performance when prices recover.
So if you please turn to Slide 4, we'll get started. We believe that our value proposition lies in the combination of our unique portfolio attributes and our capital allocation principles. Let me start with the left side of this slide. Underlying our value proposition is a portfolio that we think is quite unique among E&Ps. We've listed several attributes to distinguish our asset base. We have a diverse, relatively low decline base of production. We expect our decline rate to moderate somewhat over the next few years as we bring on additional tranches of low to no decline oil sands and LNG projects. Growth will come from investments in our large low cost of supply resource base.
We continue to analyze and calibrate this resource base as we believe it holds profitable investment inventory to keep production or grow modestly -- keep flat production or grow modestly for well over a decade. Within this captured resource base, we have a mix of flexible short-cycle projects and lower-risk medium-cycle investment projects. We see a role for both of these types of assets in our portfolio. And finally, the key to being successful in a cyclical business is to have a sustained low cost structure.
Now on the right side of this slide are the capital allocation principles that describe our value proposition. Conceptually, the principles are similar to the ones we had at the time of the spin, namely give cash back to shareholders, maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet and exercise disciplined growth. Obviously, these elements have been reset, but this is still how we expect to deliver returns to the shareholders.
Now let me go through these principles. We reset the dividend but we still intend to return a meaningful portion of our cash back to our shareholders through a cash dividend. In February, we set the dividend at a level that we believe can be sustained through the price cycles but that also results in a competitive yield compared to the broad market as well as to the E&Ps.
The dividend will remain a core part of our offering, and we are targeting annual real growth in that dividend going forward. We remain committed to have a strong investment-grade balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of a strong balance sheet. We have set a target to get our debt to less than $25 billion. The pace of that debt reduction will depend on prices and asset sales progress. But Delevering is a top priority as we come out of the downturn.
We have positioned the company to compete on financial returns. So despite having a large low cost of supply portfolio, we won't grow for growth's sake. We'll continue to be very disciplined about how we allocate our growth capital. We're in a strong position to do that as we come to the end of a significant major project investment phase. You'll notice that we're stating that our growth could be on an absolute or a per share basis. Again, financial returns are at the core of our value proposition. If we get the returns right, the rest will follow, and we're committed to getting the returns right.
So the way we think about creating value through the cycles is to have clear principles that align with a competitive portfolio to generate strong returns for the shareholders. One without the other is not sufficient and we believe we have both. We believe we have a sound value proposition. But what also matters is how we are executing our value proposition for the short, medium and long term. And it's important to be disciplined across all 3 time horizons, especially coming out of this price downturn, and I'll cover this on the next slide.
First, the short term. For us, it's all about defending against low prices in 2016 and '17. In the first quarter, we raised $4.6 billion of low-cost debt. We announced this morning that we're further cutting 2016 capital from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion. We reset the dividend for the lower end of the price cycle. We have strong liquidity, including about $5 billion of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter.
We think we took the right short-term steps to protect against an extended period of weak prices. At the same time, we're staying disciplined and continuing to safely execute our operating plan, and Al will provide more details about that in a moment. But we're running well and our key projects are on track. Finally, we're focused on lowering the breakeven cost to the business.
Now for perspective, if we were in a steady-state world of sustained $45 per barrel oil prices, we believe we could cover the capital required to maintain flat production and pay our dividend with cash from operations. Now this steady state for us comes after completion of our major projects and a reallocation of capital to our low cost of supply, conventional and unconventional portfolio.
This positions us to accelerate performance as prices improve in the medium term. Debt reduction will be a priority, and we'll target growing the dividend on a real annual basis. We remain focused on safely executing the business. We'll complete several major projects in the medium term that will ramp up production for most projects. Finally, when prices start to recover, it'll be important to stay diligent on our cost efforts.
Our long-term goal is to execute predictable performance in a world of lower, more volatile prices. We can do this by achieving our target debt level and striving to maintain cash flow neutrality. Now we define cash flow neutrality as CapEx for flat production plus our dividend equals cash from operations. As we generate cash in excess of cash flow neutrality, we have choices about how to allocate those funds. We can return cash to shareholders through share repurchases or we could fund more investments in our low cost of supply resource base. Growth CapEx will compete with distributions to shareholders. That means we're not setting a target for absolute growth because we're willing to grow on a per share basis if that makes more sense.
We'll continue to high-grade the portfolio, and those proceeds will be allocated to debt reduction, distributions and CapEx. We could also choose to keep additional cash on hand, especially if we thought another low price cycle was approaching. The decisions on how we allocate the cash flows will be based on staying disciplined, achieving the best returns and maximizing value for shareholders.
Now certainly, the last 18 months have really brought home some fundamentals for how to thrive in a cyclical business. We believe it's essential to have a high degree of capital flexibility, a low cost of supply portfolio, best-in-class cost structure and a strong balance sheet. Most of all, you have to be disciplined. The way to win in a cyclical business is to have a low cost of supply portfolio and to be the most resilient when prices are low and the most disciplined when prices are high.
I hope these short comments were helpful, but on Slide 6, I'll summarize the results for the quarter. The left column recaps the strategic actions that I've just described. The middle column captures our operational highlights, and Al will discuss those in a bit more detail. We met our goals and our important capital programs are impressed -- are progressing well.
The right column summarizes the financial results for the quarter. There's no getting around it. It was a very weak quarter financially. Underlying performance on the things we can control like operating cost was strong, but the bottom line was a large adjusted net loss that clearly reflected the weak commodity price environment.
So now let me to turn the call over to Don for a few comments on our financial results."
296527,330355155,966270,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Ryan. I'll start with our first quarter adjusted earnings on Slide 8. As Ryan mentioned, we had a strong quarter operationally, but low commodity prices continued to dominate the quarter's financial results. We reported an adjusted net loss of $1.",542,"Thanks, Ryan. I'll start with our first quarter adjusted earnings on Slide 8. As Ryan mentioned, we had a strong quarter operationally, but low commodity prices continued to dominate the quarter's financial results. We reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion or $0.95 per share, with realized prices down 20% sequentially and 38% year-over-year.
First quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide. Our segment adjusted earnings are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail. The only notable item to call out this quarter is in the Lower 48, where earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million as a result of a dry hole at the Melmar prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. 
A couple of other items of note. While we have lowered capital guidance, we are not changing any other guidance items at this time. This includes operating expense, which ran light to expectations in this quarter. We expect to give you an update at midyear. Also, we've updated our sensitivities in the appendix of this deck. We changed Henry Hub to reflect the impact of last year's asset sales and WTI to reflect production decline in the Lower 48 due to reduced drilling activity.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll cover production. First quarter production averaged 1.578 million BOE per day, which was the upper end of guidance, reflecting increased ramp at APLNG and better performance across the portfolio. Last year's first quarter volumes were 1.61 million BOE per day, but after adjusting for dispositions, first quarter 2015 volumes would be 1.54 million BOE per day. As a reminder, the majority of those dispositions were natural gas properties. So as a result, North American gas represents only 19% of our overall production this quarter compared to 24% in the year-ago period.
Continuing through the waterfall and netting out the differences in down time, we saw an underlying increase of 34,000 BOE per day or 2%. That increase came primarily from APLNG gas and Canadian bitumen, partly offset by a decline in North American gas. This gets you to 1.578 million BOE per day of production for the quarter, so underlying performance is strong.
If you turn to Slide 10, I'll cover the cash flows during the quarter. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and generated $700 million from operating activities, excluding working capital. Working capital was an offset of about $400 million in the first quarter, but we expect it to be awash for the full year.
During the quarter, we received about $100 million in -- of net proceeds from dispositions. Net debt increased by $4.5 billion and capital spending for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which we expect to be the high watermark for the year. After dividend payments of $300 million, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
It was a tough quarter financially, but we ended the quarter with a significant amount of cash on hand and strong liquidity to manage through the price environment. We can't do much about prices, but the key is to continue executing the business well and we're doing that as you'll now hear from Al."
296527,330355155,966270,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief update on each of our operating segments and then we can move on to your questions. I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments on Slide 12.In the Lower 48, our production in the first quarter was 491,000 barrels o",945,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief update on each of our operating segments and then we can move on to your questions. I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments on Slide 12.
In the Lower 48, our production in the first quarter was 491,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's down 15,000 barrels per day or 3% compared to our first quarter production last year once you adjust for asset sales. The reduction is primarily due to our reduced rig count last year, which is impacting our production this year.
We further exercised our capital flexibility in the Lower 48 and dropped down to 3 operated rigs in April, and we plan to stay at that level through 2016. Now that said, even with the lower rig count, we're continuing to realize strong efficiencies in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and we'll keep leveraging technology and working with our vendors to improve performance and capture deflation where possible.
In exploration, the nonoperated Gibson well is currently drilling. However, that's the last exploration well that we plan to drill in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In this price environment, we don't feel it's prudent to continue allocating capital to new deepwater prospects, so we no longer plan to drill Horus or Socorro, which we had planned to drill with the Maersk Valiant drill ship. By the way, these changes account for about half of our 2016 capital reduction from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion that Ryan referred to earlier.
Looking at Canada, our production was 293,000 barrels per day. That's an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2015 production of 288,000 after adjusting for dispositions. The increase is driven mostly by improved well performance in Western Canada and ramp-up at Surmont 2. In the past year, we've increased our bitumen production by 6% and reduced underlying gas production by 3%. But when you include asset sales though, gas is down 23% so we've significantly changed our production mix in Canada.
So moving over to Slide 13, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. These regions have many of our legacy assets that still compete for capital. As you can see, the low cost of supply projects we brought online over the last couple of years are beginning to offset natural declines.
In Alaska, we're seeing favorable results from our CD5 and Drill Site 2S projects, which both started up in the fourth quarter of last year and are contributing to a 3% production increase over the first quarter of 2015. We also just approved an additional phase at CD5, which will bring more wells online in late 2017. We're starting activity at GMT1, which was sanctioned at the end of 2015 and is expected to come online in late 2018.
In Europe, production is also up 3% versus the first quarter of 2015, and we have several more projects underway, which are expected to start up over the next couple of years. In late 2015, we successfully took over operatorship at Britannia, which was previously operated by a joint venture. We're seeing cost savings from this action and is a good example of efficiency improvements that we've been able to implement.
Slide 14 covers our last 2 segments: Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International. In APME, production is up 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 10% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the ramp-up at APLNG. Train 1 is running well and ramped up more quickly than anticipated, with 11 cargoes loaded in the first quarter. And as of earlier this week, we've actually now loaded 15 cargoes at APLNG. In Malaysia, we're ramping up at Gumusut after starting up the gas and water injection, and we're continuing to progress the Malikai project, which should start producing next year.
As the Other International segment is exploration-focused, the main news for the quarter is from Senegal, where we completed several successful appraisal wells and drill stem tests to further evaluate this new play opening discovery.
So Ryan started the call with details of our value proposition and strategy and then Don covered the financial results. If you'll turn to Slide 15, I'll wrap up with our operational outlook for the year. While we continue to focus on lowering capital and reducing costs, we're committed to safely delivering on our operational commitments. As we previously guided, we expect our 2016 production to be essentially flat to 2015 when you exclude the full year effects of asset sales. This result is driven by some decline in the Lower 48 unconventionals as we continue to exercise our capital flexibility there, offset by growth in the other segments.
In the second quarter, production is expected to be between 1.5 million and 1.54 million barrels per day. The reduction from first quarter is a result of major turnaround activity we have planned primarily in Europe. Turnaround activity will continue into the third quarter, mostly in Europe and Alaska. By the fourth quarter, we expect production to increase as our major turnarounds are completed.
We're continuing to ramp up at Surmont 2 in Canada and have ongoing project developments in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific that will also add to production. Finally, in Australia, we expect to deliver the first cargo from APLNG Train 2 in the fourth quarter of this year.
So the price environment continues to be challenging, but as always, we'll continue to focus on the things we can control, delivering best-in-class safety performance, bringing our projects online, on time and on budget and meeting or exceeding our operating targets.
So now I'll turn the call over for Q&A."

We'll be looking at the entire macro environment, looking at supply and demand fundamentals of whether we think that any price action that we get is actually sustainable or not. And then as prices do come back, our first priority is going to be to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce our debt. And then even after that, we recognize that adding capital for organic growth is going to have to compete with other things on our list like, for example, per share growth.

The $0.7 billion of reduction, just about half of that, as I mentioned earlier, comes from the reduction that were taken earlier by -- on deepwater Gulf of Mexico by not drilling Horus and Socorro. The next biggest item after that actually is additional deflation beyond what we had already assumed in our numbers. And then beyond that, it's all smaller things around the world in different places, APLNG, China, Indonesia with some small reductions. APLNG is a joint venture because we've got some extra cargoes over what we'd anticipated. Because the plan's running so well, that extra revenue has us putting a little less cash in there. So it's things, smaller things like that, that add up to the rest of that to get us to that $5.7 billion. So none of those things are going to have any impact on 2016 production, only a very tiny impact on 2017 production, some of those small deferrals. As far as the way you think about how much CapEx it takes to stay flat, the only thing on that list that might impact that a bit is just the deflation. We're still in that $5 billion to $6 billion range of what it's going to take to stay flat over a long period of time.

And then our unconventional investments, which, I think, was more the point of your question, around Eagle Ford and the Bakken, while they could have a gross wide range of costs of supply, if you're in the best trucks [ph] like we are and in the positions that we are, those costs of supplies are very competitive with anything that we've got or any non-OPEC kind of investments that you refer to around the world today. So we'll talk a bit more about that in the Analyst Meeting that Ellen referred to coming up to show you, even within our portfolio, there's a range of cost of supplies around each asset.

We have some of these mid-cycle size projects that we have executed that are going to be bringing us volumes over the next few years that are in a phase in their life where their capital is actually going to be increasing '16 to '17, and that's close to $1 billion. So that's things like Bohai Phase 3 in China, Clair Ridge, GMT1, 1H NEWS, Aasta Hansteen, some of those kind of midsized projects are going to use some of that.

So I think we're going to -- that'll be important to us to demonstrate that as well as we're going forward. So we'll be targeting some of those annual returns to the shareholders through the dividend channel and also reducing the debt as we come out of an area where we're generating free cash or we've reached that point of cash flow neutrality that you referred to. Now as we get that free cash and we think about it, what we said is we're just going to be really judicious about allocating the capital, make sure that per share growth competes with organic growth that we have in the portfolio.

And we beat that in '15 by coming down $1.7 billion down to $8 billion. And then we've taken another $1 billion out in our target for '16. And as you correctly point out, if you look at the first quarter number, multiply by 4, you get a number that's less than $6.5 billion. So we were on a really good pace in the first quarter. Our operating and our technical teams and our supply chain folks have really been successful at driving out cost. And the focus in all that work, as you were kind of hinting at, has been on sustainability, finding sustainable reductions, structural reductions while also capturing as much of the cyclical as we can even though we know we'll have to give some of that back at the end of the day. So frankly, I do expect to beat $7 billion this year. But we've got this turnaround season coming. There's also the Horus and Socorro decision. That rig was going to be on CapEx and will have about an incremental $100 million of OpEx as we have a stacked rig there. And so our organization's going to continue working.

Well, first, on supply chain, let me just mention our overall progress there. We talked at our Analyst Day a year ago about trying to get $1 billion of -- that's both CapEx and OpEx of supply chain savings. And we did achieve just a little over that in 2015 of deflation savings, CapEx and OpEx from our supply chain. And then we set a target for ourselves for this year to get another $1 billion. And so far, we're on track for that. If you look at actually captured deflation savings in 2016 for us in the first quarter, it was $300 million. That's CapEx and OpEx. So we're on track there. And in fact, they're starting to think about our window of opportunity for locking in some of these prices for longer periods of time going forward as we think about what our cost structure is going to look like as things start to come back. In terms of the rigs that we need to -- well, let me just talk about say the rigs we need to hold flat. So we're down to 3 rigs in the Lower 48 right now. We would need to get back up to 12 to 13 rigs, somewhere in that range, in order to just get back to holding our production flat, a number higher than that just start growing our production again. We have retained the capability amongst our staff to be able to do that. And so from our internal standpoint, we could do it relatively quickly if that's what we chose to do. From an external standpoint, obviously, there has been a lot of loss of both hardware capability and people capability amongst our contracting community. And so I think the first leg of returning some rigs back to work is going to be something that can be done in a fairly short amount of time. But similar to us, where we go from 3 to 12 or 13 to hold flat, well, to go to that even bigger number to grow with the whole industry trying to do that at once, I don't think that capacity is going to be there. And so it'll have to be built up over time, and I could see that being north of 1 year, 1- to 2-year kind of time frame to really build that kind of capacity back. In other words, I don't think U.S. unconventional production can go back up as fast as it came down or is coming down still."

And really, I sort of said it earlier, but it probably went by fast that when we think about this $5 billion to $6 billion over long periods of time to hold production flat, that's a real number, it's $5 billion to $6 billion today. If we have inflation and how that inflation comes back in depends on what's happened in the market and the industry, then the nominal number can go up over time. So it's $5 billion to $6 billion under today's conditions or low price conditions. And in a scenario where we're moving back up $60, $70s to $80s in the oil price, that number is going to go up. It's going to reflate. And so we've done some estimates on how much of the cost reduction we've got, we think it's structural versus cyclical, but certainly, there's a significant cyclical component that will come back as you move back up. Now on some of these medium cycle projects, the ones you mentioned, those costs are fairly well locked in already, and so they're not going to change with reflation. The place where it will hit us first is in the unconventional North America just as that was the place where we first captured and most heavily captured deflation. I expect that's where we'll see reflation coming back first. And so I also mentioned a minute ago that one of the things we've been doing to counteract that a bit is in the first quarter, that's when we started to work on locking in pricing for longer periods of time, particularly in the L48, the unconventional, where we give out the right to be able to rebid when we think things are going lower, but instead lock in the price as things move higher over a longer period of time. Just trying to delay when some of that reflation comes back into our numbers."

And as we learn more about the unconventionals more and more, the technology, the work that we've done over the last few years, we just see lower cost of supply and a lot more resilience in that portfolio. So I think the portfolio will continue to evolve and occupy a big piece of what we talked about. And then certainly, what's different is, while the dividend decision was difficult, probably the most difficult I've had to make as we reset [ph] the company. So we have -- I think we've lowered the breakeven for the company. We start to generate free cash flow, which is something we didn't have sort of at the spin as we came out of that. It was going to take until these major projects and we got through these long cycle time projects to get up and running before we reach that condition. That was the case post spin, and that's even more so the case now. And I think what's different now is that the deeper and a better understanding of the low cost of supply that sits in the portfolio. It was captured, which have informed our deepwater decision as well here about a year ago, which was a tough one at the time, looks better today obviously but was certainly a tougher one at the time. But it's been informed by what we've -- as we've interrogated the portfolio and applied technology to that, what we can do with the existing captured resource base and the kind of growth we can see are flat capital for a decade or more just by exercising the options we have in the captured portfolio."

That's one of the things that's driven our thinking around deepwater is that you haven't been able to drive -- that cost of supply hasn't -- the structural part of it has been a bit more difficult to drive it down versus say unconventional. Now with regard to your question on how industry comes back in the U.S. on the unconventional side, I don't think we're going to be the only ones thinking that we want to do some debt reduction before we go back to running rigs. So I expect that, that, along with some of the effects we were talking about earlier, will cause things not to come back up at the same speed that they came down. And of course, there will be that delay effect as well. Just as we had on the way down, you'll have that on the way up. I already mentioned some of the things that we're doing on the supply chain side to try to manage our cost on the way up. But I will say, we talked earlier, as we get to a free cash flow position and we're judging whether we want to put somebody to organic growth versus per share growth versus other uses of that capital, one of the things we'll be looking at is what the cost is doing. If costs are reflating all the way back to where they were before, then our interest in putting that money back to work and that kind of work is going to be lower. So we're going to be disciplined in managing those costs. And the pace that we go back to work will partly depend -- the attractiveness of that will partly depend on how that reflation works."

Before I jump into the quarterly results, I want to make some general comments about the company and the environment that we find ourselves in today. On the next couple of slides, I'll addres",1442,"Thank you, Ellen, and thanks to all for joining the call today. Before I jump into the quarterly results, I want to make some general comments about the company and the environment that we find ourselves in today. On the next couple of slides, I'll address how ConocoPhillips is positioning to create value as an independent E&P company. I'll describe our value proposition and how we'll compete in a world of lower mid-cycle and more volatile prices. I'll also describe how we are prioritizing our business activities in the short term, the medium term and the long term. I think it's important for investors to know how we're thinking about the current environment but also how we have positioned the company for strong performance when prices recover.
So if you please turn to Slide 4, we'll get started. We believe that our value proposition lies in the combination of our unique portfolio attributes and our capital allocation principles. Let me start with the left side of this slide. Underlying our value proposition is a portfolio that we think is quite unique among E&Ps. We've listed several attributes to distinguish our asset base. We have a diverse, relatively low decline base of production. We expect our decline rate to moderate somewhat over the next few years as we bring on additional tranches of low to no decline oil sands and LNG projects. Growth will come from investments in our large low cost of supply resource base.
We continue to analyze and calibrate this resource base as we believe it holds profitable investment inventory to keep production or grow modestly -- keep flat production or grow modestly for well over a decade. Within this captured resource base, we have a mix of flexible short-cycle projects and lower-risk medium-cycle investment projects. We see a role for both of these types of assets in our portfolio. And finally, the key to being successful in a cyclical business is to have a sustained low cost structure.
Now on the right side of this slide are the capital allocation principles that describe our value proposition. Conceptually, the principles are similar to the ones we had at the time of the spin, namely give cash back to shareholders, maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet and exercise disciplined growth. Obviously, these elements have been reset, but this is still how we expect to deliver returns to the shareholders.
Now let me go through these principles. We reset the dividend but we still intend to return a meaningful portion of our cash back to our shareholders through a cash dividend. In February, we set the dividend at a level that we believe can be sustained through the price cycles but that also results in a competitive yield compared to the broad market as well as to the E&Ps.
The dividend will remain a core part of our offering, and we are targeting annual real growth in that dividend going forward. We remain committed to have a strong investment-grade balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of a strong balance sheet. We have set a target to get our debt to less than $25 billion. The pace of that debt reduction will depend on prices and asset sales progress. But delevering is a top priority as we come out of the downturn.
We have positioned the company to compete on financial returns. So despite having a large low cost of supply portfolio, we won't grow for growth's sake. We'll continue to be very disciplined about how we allocate our growth capital. We're in a strong position to do that as we come to the end of this significant major project investment phase. You'll notice that we're stating that our growth could be on an absolute or a per share basis. Again, financial returns are at the core of our value proposition. If we get the returns right, the rest will follow, and we're committed to getting the returns right.
So the way we think about creating value through the cycles is to have clear principles that align with a competitive portfolio to generate strong returns for the shareholders. One without the other is not sufficient and we believe we have both. We believe we have a sound value proposition. But what also matters is how we are executing our value proposition for the short, medium and long term. And it's important to be disciplined across all 3 time horizons, especially coming out of this price downturn, and I'll cover this on the next slide.
First, the short term. For us, it's all about defending against low prices in 2016 and '17. In the first quarter, we raised $4.6 billion of low-cost debt. We announced this morning that we're further cutting 2016 capital from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion. We reset the dividend for the lower end of the price cycle. We have strong liquidity, including about $5 billion of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter.
We think we took the right short-term steps to protect against an extended period of weak prices. At the same time, we're staying disciplined and continuing to safely execute our operating plan, and Al will provide more details about that in a moment. But we're running well and our key projects are on track. Finally, we're focused on lowering the breakeven cost to the business.
Now for perspective, if we were in a steady-state world of sustained $45 per barrel oil prices, we believe we could cover the capital required to maintain flat production and pay our dividend with cash from operations. Now this steady state for us comes after completion of our major projects and a reallocation of capital to our low cost of supply, conventional and unconventional portfolio.
This positions us to accelerate performance as prices improve in the medium term. Debt reduction will be a priority, and we'll target growing the dividend on a real annual basis. We remain focused on safely executing the business. We'll complete several major projects in the medium term that will ramp up production for most projects. Finally, when prices start to recover, it'll be important to stay diligent on our cost efforts.
Our long-term goal is to execute predictable performance in a world of lower, more volatile prices. We can do this by achieving our target debt level and striving to maintain cash flow neutrality. Now we define cash flow neutrality as CapEx for flat production plus our dividend equals cash from operations. As we generate cash in excess of cash flow neutrality, we have choices about how to allocate those funds. We can return cash to shareholders through share repurchases or we could fund more investments in our low cost of supply resource base. Growth CapEx will compete with distributions to shareholders. That means we're not setting a target for absolute growth because we're willing to grow on a per share basis if that makes more sense.
We'll continue to high-grade the portfolio, and those proceeds will be allocated to debt reduction, distributions and CapEx. We could also choose to keep additional cash on hand, especially if we thought another low price cycle was approaching. The decisions on how we allocate the cash flows will be based on staying disciplined, achieving the best returns and maximizing value for shareholders.
Now certainly, the last 18 months have really brought home some fundamentals for how to thrive in a cyclical business. We believe it's essential to have a high degree of capital flexibility, a low cost of supply portfolio, best-in-class cost structure and a strong balance sheet. Most of all, you have to be disciplined. The way to win in a cyclical business is to have a low cost of supply portfolio and to be the most resilient when prices are low and the most disciplined when prices are high.
I hope these short comments were helpful, but on Slide 6, I'll summarize the results for the quarter. The left column recaps the strategic actions that I've just described. The middle column captures our operational highlights, and Al will discuss those in a bit more detail. We met our goals and our important capital programs are impressed -- are progressing well.
The right column summarizes the financial results for the quarter. There's no getting around it. It was a very weak quarter financially. Underlying performance on the things we can control like operating cost was strong, but the bottom line was a large adjusted net loss that clearly reflected the weak commodity price environment.
So now let me to turn the call over to Don for a few comments on our financial results."
296527,330355155,966725,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Ryan. I'll start with our first quarter adjusted earnings on Slide 8. As Ryan mentioned, we had a strong quarter operationally, but low commodity prices continued to dominate the quarter's financial results. We reported an adjusted net loss of $1.",543,"Thanks, Ryan. I'll start with our first quarter adjusted earnings on Slide 8. As Ryan mentioned, we had a strong quarter operationally, but low commodity prices continued to dominate the quarter's financial results. We reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion or $0.95 per share, with realized prices down 20% sequentially and 38% year-over-year.
First quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide. Our segment adjusted earnings are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail. The only notable item to call out this quarter is in the Lower 48, where earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million as a result of a dry hole at the Melmar prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. 
A couple of other items of note. While we have lowered capital guidance, we are not changing any other guidance items at this time. This includes operating expense, which ran light to expectations in this quarter. We expect to give you an update at midyear. Also, we've updated our sensitivities in the appendix of this deck. We changed Henry Hub to reflect the impact of last year's asset sales and WTI to reflect production decline in the Lower 48 due to reduced drilling activity.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll cover production. First quarter production averaged 1.578 million BOE per day, which was the upper end of guidance, reflecting increased ramp at APLNG and better performance across the portfolio. Last year's first quarter volumes were 1.61 million BOE per day, but after adjusting for dispositions, first quarter 2015 volumes would be 1.54 million BOE per day. As a reminder, the majority of those dispositions were natural gas properties. So as a result, North American gas represents only 19% of our overall production this quarter compared to 24% in the year-ago period.
Continuing through the waterfall and netting out the differences in down time, we saw an underlying increase of 34,000 BOE per day or 2%. That increase came primarily from APLNG gas and Canadian bitumen, partly offset by a decline in North American gas. This gets you to 1.578 million BOE per day of production for the quarter, so underlying performance is strong.
If you turn to Slide 10, I'll cover the cash flows during the quarter. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and generated $700 million from operating activities, excluding working capital. Working capital was an offset of about $400 million in the first quarter, but we expect it to be a wash for the full year.
During the quarter, we received about $100 million in -- of net proceeds from dispositions. Net debt increased by $4.5 billion and capital spending for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which we expect to be the high watermark for the year. After dividend payments of $300 million, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
It was a tough quarter financially, but we ended the quarter with a significant amount of cash on hand and strong liquidity to manage through the price environment. We can't do much about prices, but the key is to continue executing the business well and we're doing that as you'll now hear from Al."
296527,330355155,966725,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief update on each of our operating segments and then we can move on to your questions. I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments on Slide 12.In the Lower 48, our production in the first quarter was 491,000 barrels o",945,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief update on each of our operating segments and then we can move on to your questions. I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments on Slide 12.
In the Lower 48, our production in the first quarter was 491,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's down 15,000 barrels per day or 3% compared to our first quarter production last year once you adjust for asset sales. The reduction is primarily due to our reduced rig count last year, which is impacting our production this year.
We further exercised our capital flexibility in the Lower 48 and dropped down to 3 operated rigs in April, and we plan to stay at that level through 2016. Now that said, even with the lower rig count, we're continuing to realize strong efficiencies in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and we'll keep leveraging technology and working with our vendors to improve performance and capture deflation where possible.
In exploration, the nonoperated Gibson well is currently drilling. However, that's the last exploration well that we plan to drill in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In this price environment, we don't feel it's prudent to continue allocating capital to new deepwater prospects, so we no longer plan to drill Horus or Socorro, which we had planned to drill with the Maersk Valiant drill ship. By the way, these changes account for about half of our 2016 capital reduction from $6.4 billion to $5.7 billion that Ryan referred to earlier.
Looking at Canada, our production was 293,000 barrels per day. That's an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2015 production of 288,000 after adjusting for dispositions. The increase is driven mostly by improved well performance in Western Canada and ramp-up at Surmont 2. In the past year, we've increased our bitumen production by 6% and reduced underlying gas production by 3%. But when you include asset sales though, gas is down 23% so we've significantly changed our production mix in Canada.
So moving over to Slide 13, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. These regions have many of our legacy assets that still compete for capital. As you can see, the low cost of supply projects we brought online over the last couple of years are beginning to offset natural declines.
In Alaska, we're seeing favorable results from our CD5 and Drill Site 2S projects, which both started up in the fourth quarter of last year and are contributing to a 3% production increase over the first quarter of 2015. We also just approved an additional phase at CD5, which will bring more wells online in late 2017. We're starting activity at GMT1, which was sanctioned at the end of 2015 and is expected to come online in late 2018.
In Europe, production is also up 3% versus the first quarter of 2015, and we have several more projects underway, which are expected to start up over the next couple of years. In late 2015, we successfully took over operatorship at Britannia, which was previously operated by a joint venture. We're seeing cost savings from this action and is a good example of efficiency improvements that we've been able to implement.
Slide 14 covers our last 2 segments: Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International. In APME, production is up 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 10% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the ramp-up at APLNG. Train 1 is running well and ramped up more quickly than anticipated, with 11 cargoes loaded in the first quarter. And as of earlier this week, we've actually now loaded 15 cargoes at APLNG. In Malaysia, we're ramping up at Gumusut after starting up the gas and water injection, and we're continuing to progress the Malikai project, which should start producing next year.
As the Other International segment is exploration-focused, the main news for the quarter is from Senegal, where we completed several successful appraisal wells and drill stem tests to further evaluate this new play opening discovery.
So Ryan started the call with details of our value proposition and strategy and then Don covered the financial results. If you'll turn to Slide 15, I'll wrap up with our operational outlook for the year. While we continue to focus on lowering capital and reducing costs, we're committed to safely delivering on our operational commitments. As we previously guided, we expect our 2016 production to be essentially flat to 2015 when you exclude the full year effects of asset sales. This result is driven by some decline in the Lower 48 unconventionals as we continue to exercise our capital flexibility there, offset by growth in the other segments.
In the second quarter, production is expected to be between 1.5 million and 1.54 million barrels per day. The reduction from first quarter is a result of major turnaround activity we have planned primarily in Europe. Turnaround activity will continue into the third quarter, mostly in Europe and Alaska. By the fourth quarter, we expect production to increase as our major turnarounds are completed.
We're continuing to ramp up at Surmont 2 in Canada and have ongoing project developments in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific that will also add to production. Finally, in Australia, we expect to deliver the first cargo from APLNG Train 2 in the fourth quarter of this year.
So the price environment continues to be challenging, but as always, we'll continue to focus on the things we can control, delivering best-in-class safety performance, bringing our projects online, on time and on budget and meeting or exceeding our operating targets.
So now I'll turn the call over for Q&A."

We'll be looking at the entire macro environment, looking at supply and demand fundamentals and whether we think that any price action that we get is actually sustainable or not. And then as prices do come back, our first priority is going to be to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce our debt.

The $0.7 billion of reduction, just about half of that, as I mentioned earlier, comes from the reduction that were taken earlier by -- on deepwater Gulf of Mexico by not drilling Horus and Socorro. The next biggest item after that actually is additional deflation beyond what we had already assumed in our numbers. And then beyond that, it's all smaller things around the world in different places, APLNG, China, Indonesia with some small reductions. APLNG is a joint venture because we've got some extra cargoes over what we'd anticipated. Because the plant's running so well, that extra revenue has us putting a little less cash in there. So it's things, smaller things like that, that add up to the rest of that to get us to that $5.7 billion. So none of those things are going to have any impact on 2016 production, only a very tiny impact on 2017 production, some of those small deferrals. As far as the way you think about how much CapEx it takes to stay flat, the only thing on that list that might impact that a bit is just the deflation.

And then I guess, the second question, I'll just go ahead and ask them both. Are there any specific metrics you're going to be evaluating on buybacks versus reinvesting into the business? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense. Is this going to be more of a ratable type of program or more opportunistic, depending on where the equity price kind of sits at the time?"

So I think we're going to -- that'll be important to us to demonstrate that as well as we're going forward. So we'll be targeting some of those annual returns to the shareholders through the dividend channel and also reducing the debt as we come out of an area where we're generating free cash or we've reached that point of cash flow neutrality that you referred to. Now as we get that free cash and we think about it, what we said is we're just going to be really judicious about allocating the capital, make sure that per share growth competes with organic growth that we have in the portfolio. I think we'll probably may be a bit less ratable. We'll try to be a bit more opportunistic around that."

And we beat that in '15 by coming down $1.7 billion down to $8 billion. And then we've taken another $1 billion out in our target for '16. And as you correctly point out, if you look at the first quarter number, multiply by 4, you get a number that's less than $6.5 billion. So we were on a really good pace in the first quarter. Our operating and our technical teams and our supply chain folks have really been successful at driving out cost. And the focus in all that work, as you were kind of hinting at, has been on sustainability, finding sustainable reductions, structural reductions while also capturing as much of the cyclical as we can even though we know we'll have to give some of that back at the end of the day. So frankly, I do expect to beat $7 billion this year. But we've got this turnaround season coming. There's also the Horus and Socorro decision. That rig was going to be on CapEx and will have about an incremental $100 million of OpEx as we have a stacked rig there. And so our organization's going to continue working. We've got a lot of work going on to continue work on OpEx. And I expect that we'll beat that number. But really, at midyear, I think we'll be ready to update where we're going to land."

Well, first, on supply chain, let me just mention our overall progress there. We talked at our Analyst Day a year ago about trying to get $1 billion of -- that's both CapEx and OpEx of supply chain savings. And we did achieve just a little over that in 2015 of deflation savings, CapEx and OpEx from our supply chain. And then we set a target for ourselves for this year to get another $1 billion. And so far, we're on track for that. If you look at actually captured deflation savings in 2016 for us in the first quarter, it was $300 million. That's CapEx and OpEx. So we're on track there. And in fact, we're starting to think about our window of opportunity for locking in some of these prices for longer periods of time going forward as we think about what our cost structure is going to look like as things start to come back. In terms of the rigs that we need to -- well, let me just talk about say the rigs we need to hold flat. So we're down to 3 rigs in the Lower 48 right now. We would need to get back up to 12 to 13 rigs, somewhere in that range, in order to just get back to holding our production flat, and a number higher than that just start growing our production again. We have retained the capability amongst our staff to be able to do that. And so from our internal standpoint, we could do it relatively quickly if that's what we chose to do. From an external standpoint, obviously, there has been a lot of loss of both hardware capability and people capability amongst our contracting community. And so I think the first leg of returning some rigs back to work is going to be something that can be done in a fairly short amount of time. But similar to us, where we go from 3 to 12 or 13 to hold flat, well, to go to that even bigger number to grow with the whole industry trying to do that at once, I don't think that capacity is going to be there. And so it'll have to be built up over time, and I could see that being north of 1 year, 1- to 2-year kind of time frame to really build that kind of capacity back. In other words, I don't think U.S. unconventional production can go back up as fast as it came down or is coming down still."

And really, I sort of said it earlier, but it probably went by fast that when we think about this $5 billion to $6 billion over long periods of time to hold production flat, that's a real number, it's $5 billion to $6 billion today. If we have inflation and how that inflation comes back in depends on what's happening in the market and the industry, then the nominal number can go up over time. So it's $5 billion to $6 billion under today's conditions or low price conditions. And in a scenario where we're moving back up $60, $70s to $80s in the oil price, that number is going to go up. It's going to reflate. And so we've done some estimates on how much of the cost reduction we've got, we think is structural versus cyclical, but certainly, there's a significant cyclical component that will come back as you move back up. Now on some of these medium cycle projects, the ones you mentioned, those costs are fairly well locked in already, and so they're not going to change with reflation. The place where it will hit us first is in the unconventional North America just as that was the place where we first captured and most heavily captured deflation. I expect that's where we'll see reflation coming back first. And so I also mentioned a minute ago that one of the things we've been doing to counteract that a bit is in the first quarter, that's when we started to work on locking in pricing for longer periods of time, particularly in the L48, the unconventional, where we give up the right to be able to rebid when we think things are going lower, but instead lock in the price as things move higher over a longer period of time.

There's still have a lot of construction work left to do this year, so there's still a lot of capital going into that. So that's what's driving the continued capital injection into APLNG. Once we've got the trains both running, and you get into a -- into the $40s on crude price, say mid-$40s kind of price, then we'll start to get cash back out from APLNG."

It was somewhat inherited as a result of the split. As you go into this analyst meeting, what do you feel is going to be the differentiating aspect of ConocoPhillips that you want to promote? That's point 1, question 1. And then maybe for Ryan or for Al. This time around, it feels like we may be in -- maybe different insofar as  most companies are now saying they'll be less likely to commit to a very large high upfront cost, long-term projects and more likely to use the U.S. unconventional to flex production. How do you think that makes things different when we begin to spin off many times in this call when we think about how cost will inflate or not inflate going forward, how you can, I guess, differentiate yourself in that respect too?"

I'll take the first part and maybe Al can take the second part there. I think so as we go into this analyst meeting, as I tried to say in my opening comments, Paul, I think sort of our disciplined capital approach is still fundamental. We have that at the spin and we'll continue to talk about that. I think the portfolio differentiates itself. And as we learn more about the unconventionals more and more, the technology, the work that we've done over the last few years, we just see lower cost of supply and a lot more resilience in that portfolio. So I think the portfolio will continue to evolve and occupy a big piece of what we talked about. And then certainly, what's different is, while the dividend decision was difficult, probably the most difficult I've had to make. it has reset the company. So we have -- I think we've lowered the breakeven for the company. We start to generate free cash flow, which is something we didn't have sort of at the spin as we came out of that. It was going to take until these major projects and we got through these long cycle time projects to get up and running before we reach that condition. That was the case post spin, and that's even more so the case now. And I think what's different now is that the deeper and a better understanding of the low cost of supply that sits in the portfolio. It was captured, which kind of informed our deepwater decision as well here about a year ago, which was a tough one at the time, looks better today obviously but was certainly a tougher one at the time. But it's been informed by what we've -- as we've interrogated the portfolio and applied technology to that, what we can do with the existing captured resource base and the kind of growth we can see are flat capital for a decade or more just by exercising the options we have in the captured portfolio."

That's one of the things that's driven our thinking around deepwater is that you haven't been able to drive -- that cost of supply hasn't -- the structural part of it has been a bit more difficult to drive it down versus say unconventional. Now with regard to your question on how industry comes back in the U.S. on the unconventional side, I don't think we're going to be the only ones thinking that we want to do some debt reduction before we go back to running rigs. So I expect that, that, along with some of the effects we were talking about earlier, will cause things not to come back up at the same speed that they came down. And of course, there will be that delay effect as well. Just as we had on the way down, you'll have that on the way up. I already mentioned some of the things that we're doing on the supply chain side to try to manage our costs on the way up. But I will say, we talked earlier, as we get to a free cash flow position and we're judging whether we want to put somebody to organic growth versus per share growth versus other uses of that capital, one of the things we'll be looking at is what the cost is doing. If costs are reflating all the way back to where they were before, then our interest in putting that money back to work and that kind of work is going to be lower. So we're going to be disciplined in managing those costs. And the pace that we go back to work will partly depend -- the attractiveness of that will partly depend on how that reflation works."

This is a recap of our 2Q results, and Don and Al will provide more detail in a moment. But the key messages are we delivered strong operational performance, our financial performance is improving, and we're making progress strategically to position ourselves for a world of lower and more volatile prices. Let me quickly go through this slide.
Production grew year-over-year by 3%. Our second quarter performance exceeded guidance despite a busy season of turnarounds and over a month of downtime at Surmont due to the wildfires. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising the midpoint of our 2016 production guidance by 2%. 
We're also lowering our 2016 CapEx from $5.7 billion to $5.5 billion based on efficiency improvements really across all business lines. Our major projects across our portfolio are on track for startup as planned, and Al will talk about these projects in more detail.
Our financial performance was challenged like the rest of industry but did improve sequentially in line with prices. 3 of 5 of our producing segments were profitable this quarter, and I think this highlights the benefit of having a high-quality legacy assets in our portfolio. Cash flows were in line with expectations, and we ended the quarter with over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.
We're continuing to make progress on our asset sale program and expect to achieve our goal of about $1 billion of proceeds this year. We reduced debt by $800 million in the second quarter so we're making progress on improving our balance sheet.
On the strategic front, we continued our phased exit of deepwater exploration. We signed an agreement to sell our position in Senegal in July and expensed our remaining deepwater position in the Gibson and Tiber wells in the Gulf of Mexico, and we drilled a successful appraisal well at Shenandoah.
Our adjusted operating costs continue to improve across the business, and we're lowering our full year guidance there as well. This will create additional cash flow momentum as prices improve. And finally, we continue to spend a lot of time analyzing the macro outlook and the choices we have for allocating cash flows through the business cycles. This is an important aspect of our value proposition and very much on the minds of investors. We've set priorities and targets that will gather allocation decisions. By following these priorities, we can create value as prices recover and through future price cycles. 
So before I turn it over to Don and Al, I want to step through our allocation priorities and targets on the next slide. The way to create value in this business is through disciplined capital allocation. On our last quarter's call, I've outlined the principles of our capital allocation approach, which are shown on the left side of this slide. And as a reminder, they were that the dividend will remain a core part of our offering, and we're targeting real annual growth in that dividend. 
Another principle is to maintain a strong balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of this principle. For us, that means having debt of less than $25 billion. And finally, we'll focus on disciplined growth where per share growth will compete with absolute growth. 
We have positioned the company to compete on returns, so while we have a large low cost of supply portfolio, we'll be disciplined about allocating cash to volume growth. Now establishing these principles was an important first step in articulating our value proposition, especially coming out of the downturn. But we also want to set priorities and targets that will guide our incremental allocation decisions, and these are shown on the right-hand side of this slide. Let me step through them.
The first use of cash is to pay our existing dividend and invest capital to maintain our production base. Now let me be clear that flat production is not our goal but at a minimum, we want to sustain our existing production. Because of our low decline base production, we can keep production flat for over a decade, with CapEx of $5 billion to $6 billion. 
Now we believe our capital intensity is now one of the lowest among our competitors and that's a real advantage. After our cash from operations exceeds the level of required to cover our dividend and CapEx for flat volumes, the next use of cash will be to grow our quarterly dividend -- or dividend annually at the real rate. We think this is a prudent and sustainable target.
Our next priority is to reduce our debt to below $25 billion. Our target is to reduce debt as it matures, but we might accelerate some of that reduction with asset sales. Our target is to have an A-rated balance sheet, which we think is a competitive advantage.
Next, we have a target to achieve 20% to 30% total shareholder payout of cash flow from operations through a combination of our ordinary dividend and flexible share repurchases. We don't believe our ordinary dividend represents enough return of capital to shareholders through the cycles for a company of our size and. Maturity so when we have available cash flows, we expect to retain additional capital through share buybacks. 
We believe this will be a differential aspect of our offering. It will also force discipline on the system while giving us a more flexible means of returning capital to our owners. And our final priority cash flows will be in invest in our large, low cost of supply captured resource base, to allocate capital to the lowest cost of supply opportunities while maintaining an appropriate balance between short and medium cycle programs and we have that inventory to grow. 
So what I've laid out should give you a clear sense of how we plan to create value through disciplined capital allocation. You should not think of our priorities and targets as a precise formula but rather as a relative ranking of the choices we can exercise through the cycles. In some parts of the cycles, we can envision pulling at all these levers. At other times, we may be hunkered down. But in all parts of the cycle, we'll be disciplined.
So let me stop here. We'll have some more time for your questions in this call. We'll also provide a lot more detail on our strategy at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. But what you should take away from my comments is that we know where we're headed, and we have a strategy that is distinctive and will differentiate ConocoPhillips from our competitors.
So let me turn it over to Don for a few comments on our financial results."

I'll provide a quick overview of the second quarter financials, starting with adjusted earnings on Slide 7. The business is performing well operationally, and we grew production 3%, but the low commodity price environment continues to impact financial results. 
For the second quarter, with an average realized price of around $28 per BOE, we reported an adjusted net loss of roughly $1 billion or $0.79 per share. A couple of items to note that negatively impacted earnings in the quarter. We expensed our remaining position in the Keathley Canyon area of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and with respect to adjusted earnings recognized the Gibson and Tiber wells as dry holes. 
We also saw higher DD&A in the quarter and we're increasing our guidance for the year from $8.5 billion to $9.2 billion. This increase is due in part to stronger production performance but it's also related to an increase in the DD&A rate, primarily a result of price-related reserve revisions. We continue to reduce costs across the business and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the year-ago quarter.
Second quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower-right side of this slide. While Lower 48 was impacted sequentially by higher DD&A and dry hole expenses, the remaining segments are roughly in line with expectations. As a reminder, the supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
Turning to Slide 8, I'll cover production. Our second quarter production averaged 1.546 million BOE per day, which exceeded our guidance despite the wildfires in Canada. Last year's second quarter volumes were 1.595 million BOE per day or 1.523 million when adjusted for dispositions. 
Adjusting for the impact of incremental downtime, production increased by 46,000 BOE a day, representing 3% growth year-over-year. Increases in LNG and liquids volumes were partially offset by lower natural gas volumes, mostly in North America. This gets you to our 1.546 million BOE per day production for the quarter. 
If you turn now to Slide 9, I'll cover the cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and have generated $1.9 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital changes. Total working capital was a use of cash of $600 million in the first half of the year. This was largely driven by reduced capital spending and lower decommissioning activity in Europe. 
Since we don't expect a significant reversal of our spending trends for the remainder of 2016, we believe working capital will be a use of cash for the full year. Proceeds from asset sales, mostly North America Gas properties, were $400 million in the first half. Through the first 6 months, debt increased by $3.8 billion. This reflects the $4.6 billion debt raised in the first quarter, offset by $800 million of commercial paper retired in the second quarter. Capital spending for the first half of the year was $3 billion. And after dividend payments of $600 million and some other small items, we ended June with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to run through our operational performance."

I'll go through our operations by segment and then provide a brief overview of what's left to watch for in the second half of the year and then we could take your questions.
If you turn to Slide 11, I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments. In the Lower 48, our production in the second quarter was 503,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying decrease of 17,000 barrels a day compared to this time last year. 
The unconventionals produced 262,000 barrels per day or down 4% from second quarter of 2015. That's better performance than we had expected, driven primarily by better well performance in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken but also by the lag effects from our rampdown in rig activity. Now that we're running with 3 rigs, we expect decline in the unconventionals to steepen somewhat in the second half of the year. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw successful results at the latest Shenandoah 5 appraisal well, which encountered over 1,000 feet of net pay.
Moving to Canada, our production was 279,000 barrels per day. Adjusted for dispositions, we saw growth compared to the second quarter of last year, even including the wildfire impacts at Surmont. That's the result of ongoing ramp-up of our oil sands projects, which provided a 16% increase in bitumen production compared to this time last year. We expect growth to continue as Surmont 2 ramps up to full capacity through 2017 and we bring additional phases online at FCCL. We also achieved first production with the commissioning of the Foster Creek Phase G during the second quarter, and we're progressing toward first production at Christina Lake Phase F.
Moving to Slide 12, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. In Alaska, we saw growth compared to the same time last year, with second quarter production of 179,000 barrels per day. This came from ongoing strong production at CD5 and Drill Site 2S. In the quarter, we also approved an expansion phase of CD5, which will add an additional 16 wells and bring CD5 to its full design capacity. We have significant turnaround activity planned in Alaska for the third quarter at both Kuparuk and Alpine. And finally, we completed the sale of our Beluga River asset in the Cook Inlet during the quarter.
In Europe and North Africa, production of 187,000 barrels per day was down 20,000 barrels per day compared to the same period last year. That decrease is primarily the result of increased turnaround activity in this year's second quarter. In the U.K. at Clair Ridge, the drilling and production modules were successfully installed, and progress is also continuing at Alder where we expect to achieve first reduction in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll cover the Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International segments. In APME, production was 398,000 barrels per day, up 14% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the ongoing ramp-up at APLNG. Train 1 is continuing to run ahead of expectations, with 27 cargoes loaded in the first half of the year, including our first cargo to Kansai Electric in Japan. We're on track to deliver the first cargo from Train 2 in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In Malaysia, Gumusut's continuing to produce at a high level, and third-party pipeline commissioning is underway at KBB, so we're beginning to see increased production volumes there as well. And the sale away of the Malikai TLP was completed this month, with start-up expected next year. In the Other International segment, the key milestone was signing the SPA for the sale of our exploration blocks in Senegal in July. This sale is expected to generate proceeds of $400 million to $450 million.
If you turn to Slide 14, I'll provide a few comments about our outlook for the rest of the year. As Ryan and Don mentioned, the business has performed well through the first half of the year. We're updating our full year production guidance to 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels per day. That's an increase of 35,000 barrels per day or about 2% over prior guidance. While at the same time, we're lowering both our capital and our operating cost guidance. 
For the third quarter, we expect production to be between 1.51 million and 1.55 million barrels per day, which reflects ongoing turnaround activity in Europe and Alaska. Our project activity is on track. We're continuing to ramp up at our Surmont and FCCL projects and are progressing several other projects in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific. 
We expect to complete our Senegal sale before the end of the year, and we're continuing to market our remaining deepwater exploration positions in Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. And then finally, just a reminder that we will host our 2016 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York on November 10. At that meeting, we'll provide more details on our cash flow priorities, our low cost of supply portfolio and our future investment plans. So we look forward to seeing all of you at that update. And now I'll turn it over for Q&A."

So we recognize that as prices recover, that's not enough payout to the shareholders. Even when we spun the company, we were talking about these kinds of payout levels. We were doing that with the just the ordinary dividend at the time. So we set a pretty broad range, 20% to 30%. And clearly, we'll take a look at that as the circumstances warrant and then compare really, as you get down to those fourth and fifth priorities, it's about what kind of investments do we have shareholders would want us to be making in the portfolio, what kind of returns do they have? What kind of cost to supply do they have?

But if you just look at our near-term performance on volumes, take -- start out with second quarter volumes, we beat the midpoint of our guidance by 26,000 barrels a day, and we're even above the high end of our range, and that was despite being -- having about a negative 15 [ph] at Surmont due to the wildfires. So you can see there that there are a lot of parts of our business that are really performing well. And the single biggest area that drove that outperformance on volumes was the Lower 48 unconventionals as you kind of see from some of the numbers we were quoting to Paul's question earlier. The decline, even running just 3 rigs in Lower 48, we're seeing better performance on the volume side and on the cost side in our Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a key driver. And then as you look toward the end of the year, the strong momentum that we're going to have on volumes will have Alder starting up, APLNG Train 2, Surmont 2 will be continuing to ramp, KBB volumes are moving up, FCCLs. So we have a lot of different projects that'll be adding volumes that give us a lot of confidence that we can continue to drive that volume performance of at least flat or even growth if we want to at these lower kind of capital levels that we've been talking about.

And what we wanted to try to tell folks is we feel comfortable with paying off the debt as it matures with the cash flow. So as we get some recovery in prices and we're generating cash flow above the -- above what it takes to hold production flat and pay the dividend, we'll go ahead and put that to the balance sheet. But we're not going to spend $4 billion before we do anything else because we think we can get there over time over the next couple of years. As you say with the natural maturities that we have on the balance sheet, and then we know we want to get back into the market with some asset sales when the market starts are covering. So we know that we'll be selling some more of our noncore assets, and we'll always have that to help us accelerate that debt repayment. But the main message is it's manageable.

And my answer was 10%. At that time, it looked our projection was we would drop about 10% on our Lower 48 unconventionals. With this update and with the performance we've had in the second quarter, that number's been cut roughly in half. About 6% now is what we think will be down in Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a big change, holding that same flat 3-rig rate. We've also got some improved production in Europe and Malaysia. And so really if you think about it, those are all above-average margin barrels for us.

Let me just start kind of with your first question, sort of. Yes, we have a lot of confidence. As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital, at kind of today's inflationary rates and what's going on in the market today, we can see with our portfolio a decade of flat production at that kind of level. So with the opportunities that we have to invest in the portfolio even at the lower capital levels, yes, we're pretty clear about what we can do over a long period of time at that kind of a level. And while that's driven by the fact that after we get APLNG up and running second train and we get Surmont 2 ramped up, we've got 500,000 [ph] -- we got 1/3 of our production base that's virtually no decline for the next 20 years. I think that's what's unique about our company and helps us drive down this maintenance capital level or this capital to hold our production flat to the kind of level that we're seeing. Now as that translates to F&D, it's a little bit tougher question because now you're bringing the vagaries of reserves and bookings and all that kind of stuff. And that gets to be a little bit more tougher question. But generally, you're right. It has to drive SMB down from where we've been at over the last few years. But in our portfolio, where we do have a pretty high RFP so we are willing to let that moderate some because the bookings will not necessarily exactly follow the capital as we go forward. So reserve bookings end up being lumpy. But over time, over 3- and 5-year periods, yes, the F&D should follow. And as you're starting to book all the resources that you're developing, typically in the unconventionals, even in the Eagle Ford, we're booked to a small percentage of what we think the total resource potential will ultimately be out of Eagle Ford. So the F&D is lumpy but generally over time, it should happen but there's probably some drift in RFP."

And we've tried to tell you what we're going to do with that free cash flow in a big -- prevalent piece of that is a recognition that we need to return more to the shareholders as prices start to recover relative to where the ordinary dividend is. But I'll tell you, I think there's a lot of differentiating factors in the portfolio. The maintenance capital keep flat production, the quality of the investment cases that we have, the of supply we have in the portfolio, we'll show you that in quite a lot of detail in November. But I think there's space in this E&P world for a company like ours that is focused on returns. We know given our size that we can't compete against the growth, the pure play smaller growth companies. So -- but we're going into a world of lower and high volatile prices and some predictability, which I think executions since we spun the company. We've delivered on everything we said. We know how to run the company. We know how to run this business. We know what we're doing. And as we think about that, there's space in the E&P space for a company that is differential on returns. And that can be more predictable through the cycles and do that both on the low and the upper end. And finally, ever since we spun the company, we've been saying that we'll give returns back to our shareholders right off the top, and that's what we're trying to tell you here is an important part of our offering, the 20%, 30%, we recognize needs to go to the shareholder to create discipline within the company. And that, combined with our flexible investments and what the portfolio looks like, we think will differentiate ourselves."

So as we think about it going forward, it's kind of really, really cautious as we go through 2016. And it's going to take well into '17 before we see any real increases in the price. So we're -- we continue, as Al said, we're down the hatches. We're focused on lowering the capital required to deliver the scope, and we're focused on reducing the cost and trying to get our breakeven down as low as it possibly get because we're going to be in this world for periods of time over the next 1 year, 1.5 years."

I don't mean to be pedantic with it but I just wanted to clarify that. And then the second piece is the 20% to 30% target on cash flow being paid out to shareholders that's being put above growth capital.

I realize the inflation rate is quite low today but we're -- what we're trying to say is we're not going to be trying to increase the dividend annually to get back to somewhere like we were before we cut the dividend. So we're recognizing [indiscernible] pain and the agony of the dividend decision to reset the fixed cost of the company at the lower end of the cycle. And we recognize as we go through the middle part of the trough and to the upper end of the cycle, that's not enough return to the shareholders. So we're going to augment that with a variable distribution plan around share buyback. And while we say a lot of the -- can you be countercyclic and that kind of role? We're going to look at that pretty judiciously. We'll have a view of commodity prices today and where we think they're going over the next 3 [ph] years. We'll look at how our shares are trading in the marketplace and we'll make a decision on what the level of share buyback is. Certainly at a minimum, we like to offset the dilution that our stock programs to our employees provide so that would sort of set a floor on the share buyback. But again, I think there's bright lines between all of these. And as I tried to say in my comments, as the prices start to recover, we can envision doing a little bit of everything. We're going to be doing some share buyback but we're also going to be investing in the portfolio as well. But certainly review making sure that we hit that 20% to 30% return to our shareholders is an important hurdle for estimate before we start investing in the portfolio."

This is a recap of our 2Q results, and Don and Al will provide more detail in a moment. But the key messages are we delivered strong operational performance, our financial performance is improving and we're making progress strategically to position ourselves for a world of lower and more volatile prices. Let me quickly go through this slide.
Production grew year-over-year by 3%. Our second quarter performance exceeded guidance despite a busy season of turnarounds and over a month of downtime at Surmont due to the wildfires. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising the midpoint of our 2016 production guidance by 2%.
We're also lowering our 2016 CapEx from $5.7 billion to $5.5 billion based on efficiency improvements really across all business lines. Our major projects across our portfolio are on track for startup as planned, and Al will talk about these projects in more detail.
Our financial performance was challenged like the rest of industry but did improve sequentially in line with prices. 3 of 5 of our producing segments were profitable this quarter, and I think this highlights the benefit of having high-quality legacy assets in our portfolio. Cash flows were in line with expectations, and we ended the quarter with over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.
We're continuing to make progress on our asset sale program and expect to achieve our goal of about $1 billion of proceeds this year. We reduced debt by $800 million in the second quarter, so we're making progress on improving our balance sheet.
On the strategic front, we continued our phased exit of deepwater exploration. We signed an agreement to sell our position in Senegal in July and expensed our remaining deepwater position in the Gibson and Tiber wells in the Gulf of Mexico, and we drilled a successful appraisal well at Shenandoah.
Our adjusted operating costs continue to improve across the business, and we're lowering our full year guidance there as well. This will create additional cash flow momentum as prices improve. And finally, we continue to spend a lot of time analyzing the macro outlook and the choices we have for allocating cash flows through the business cycles. This is an important aspect of our value proposition and very much on the minds of investors. We've set priorities and targets that will guide our allocation decisions. By following these priorities, we can create value as prices recover and through future price cycles.
So before I turn it over to Don and Al, I want to step through our allocation priorities and targets on the next slide. The way to create value in this business is through disciplined capital allocation. On last quarter's call, I had outlined the principles of our capital allocation approach, which are shown on the left side of this slide. And as a reminder, they were that the dividend will remain a core part of our offering, and we're targeting real annual growth in that dividend.
Another principle is to maintain a strong balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of this principle. For us, that means having debt of less than $25 billion. And finally, we'll focus on disciplined growth where per share growth will compete with absolute growth.
We have positioned the company to compete on returns. So while we have a large low cost of supply portfolio, we'll be disciplined about allocating cash to volume growth. Now establishing these principles was an important first step in articulating our value proposition, especially coming out of the downturn. But we also want to set priorities and targets that will guide our incremental allocation decisions, and these are shown on the right-hand side of this slide. Let me step through them.
The first use of cash is to pay our existing dividend and invest capital to maintain our production base. Now let me be clear that flat production is not our goal. But at a minimum, we want to sustain our existing production. Because of our low decline base production, we can keep production flat for over a decade with CapEx of $5 billion to $6 billion.
Now we believe our capital intensity is now one of the lowest among our competitors, and that's a real advantage. After our cash from operations exceeds the level required to cover our dividend and CapEx for flat volumes, the next use of cash will be to grow our quarterly dividend -- or dividend annually at a real rate. We think this is a prudent and sustainable target.
Our next priority is to reduce our debt to below $25 billion. Our target is to reduce debt as it matures, but we might accelerate some of that reduction with asset sales. Our target is to have an A-rated balance sheet, which we think is a competitive advantage.
Next, we have a target to achieve 20% to 30% total shareholder payout of cash flow from operations through a combination of our ordinary dividend and flexible share repurchases. We don't believe our ordinary dividend represents enough return of capital to shareholders through the cycles for a company our size and maturity. So when we have available cash flows, we expect to return additional capital through share buybacks.
We believe this will be a differential aspect of our offering. It will also force discipline on the system while giving us a more flexible means of returning capital to our owners. And our final priority, cash flows will be to invest in our large, low cost of supply captured resource base, [ph] will allocate capital to the lowest cost of supply opportunities while maintaining an appropriate balance between short and medium cycle programs and we have that inventory to grow.
So what I've laid out should give you a clear sense of how we plan to create value through disciplined capital allocation. You should not think of our priorities and targets as a precise formula but rather as a relative ranking of the choices we can exercise through the cycles. In some parts of the cycles, we can envision pulling at all these levers. At other times, we may be hunkered down. But in all parts of the cycle, we'll be disciplined.
So let me stop here. We'll have some more time for your questions in this call. We'll also provide a lot more detail on our strategy at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. But what you should take away from my comments is that we know where we're headed, and we have a strategy that is distinctive and will differentiate ConocoPhillips from our competitors.
So let me turn it over to Don for a few comments on our financial results."

I'll provide a quick overview of the second quarter financials, starting with adjusted earnings on Slide 7. The business is performing well operationally and we grew production 3%, but the low commodity price environment continues to impact financial results. For the second quarter, with an average realized price of around $28 per BOE, we reported an adjusted net loss of roughly $1 billion or $0.79 per share.
A couple of items to note that negatively impacted earnings in the quarter. We expensed our remaining position in the Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and with respect to adjusted earnings, recognized the Gibson and Tiber wells as dry holes.
We also saw higher DD&A in the quarter, and we're increasing our guidance for the year from $8.5 billion to $9.2 billion. This increase is due in part to stronger production performance, but it's also related to an increase in the DD&A rate, primarily a result of price-related reserve revisions. We continue to reduce costs across the business and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the year-ago quarter.
Second quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower-right side of this slide. While Lower 48 was impacted sequentially by higher DD&A and dry hole expenses, the remaining segments are roughly in line with expectations. As a reminder, the supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
Turning to Slide 8, I'll cover production. Our second quarter production averaged 1.546 million BOE per day, which exceeded our guidance despite the wildfires in Canada. Last year's second quarter volumes were 1.595 million BOE per day or 1.523 million when adjusted for dispositions.
Adjusting for the impact of incremental downtime, production increased by 46,000 BOE a day, representing 3% growth year-over-year. Increases in LNG and liquids volumes were partially offset by lower natural gas volumes, mostly in North America. This gets you to our 1.546 million BOE per day production for the quarter.
If you turn now to Slide 9, I'll cover the cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and have generated $1.9 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital changes. Total working capital was a use of cash of $600 million in the first half of the year. This was largely driven by reduced capital spending and lower decommissioning activity in Europe.
Since we don't expect a significant reversal of our spending trends for the remainder of 2016, we believe working capital will be a use of cash for the full year. Proceeds from asset sales, mostly North America Gas properties, were $400 million in the first half. Through the first 6 months, debt increased by $3.8 billion. This reflects the $4.6 billion debt raised in the first quarter, offset by $800 million of commercial paper retired in the second quarter. Capital spending for the first half of the year was $3 billion. And after dividend payments of $600 million and some other small items, we ended June with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to run through our operational performance."

I'll go through our operations by segment and then provide a brief overview of what's left to watch for in the second half of the year and then we could take your questions.
If you turn to Slide 11, I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments. In the Lower 48, our production in the second quarter was 503,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying decrease of 17,000 barrels a day compared to this time last year.
The unconventionals produced 262,000 barrels per day or down 4% from second quarter of 2015. That's better performance than we had expected, driven primarily by better well performance in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken but also by the lag effects from our ramp down in rig activity. Now that we're running with 3 rigs, we expect decline in the unconventionals to steepen somewhat in the second half of the year. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw successful results at the latest Shenandoah 5 appraisal well, which encountered over 1,000 feet of net pay.
Moving to Canada, our production was 279,000 barrels per day. Adjusted for dispositions, we saw growth compared to the second quarter of last year, even including the wildfire impacts at Surmont. That's the result of ongoing ramp-up of our oil sands projects, which provided a 16% increase in bitumen production compared to this time last year. We expect growth to continue as Surmont 2 ramps up to full capacity through 2017 and we bring additional phases online at FCCL. We also achieved first production with the commissioning of the Foster Creek Phase G during the second quarter, and we're progressing toward first production at Christina Lake Phase F.
Moving to Slide 12, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. In Alaska, we saw growth compared to the same time last year, with second quarter production of 179,000 barrels per day. This came from ongoing strong production at CD5 and Drill Site 2S. In the quarter, we also approved an expansion phase of CD5, which will add an additional 16 wells and bring CD5 to its full design capacity. We have significant turnaround activity planned in Alaska for the third quarter at both Kuparuk and Alpine. And finally, we completed the sale of our Beluga River asset in the Cook Inlet during the quarter.
In Europe and North Africa, production of 187,000 barrels per day was down 20,000 barrels per day compared to the same period last year. That decrease is primarily the result of increased turnaround activity in this year's second quarter. In the U.K., at Clair Ridge, the drilling and production modules were successfully installed, and progress is also continuing at Alder where we expect to achieve first reduction in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll cover the Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International segments. In APME, production was 398,000 barrels per day, up 14% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the ongoing ramp-up at APLNG. Train 1 is continuing to run ahead of expectations with 27 cargoes loaded in the first half of the year, including our first cargo to Kansai Electric in Japan. We're on track to deliver the first cargo from Train 2 in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In Malaysia, Gumusut's continuing to produce at a high level, and third-party pipeline commissioning is underway at KBB, so we're beginning to see increased production volumes there as well. And the sailaway of the Malikai TLP was completed this month, with startup expected next year. In the Other International segment, the key milestone was signing the SPA for the sale of our exploration blocks in Senegal in July. This sale is expected to generate proceeds of $400 million to $450 million.
If you turn to Slide 14, I'll provide a few comments about our outlook for the rest of the year. As Ryan and Don mentioned, the business has performed well through the first half of the year. We're updating our full year production guidance to 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels per day. That's an increase of 35,000 barrels per day or about 2% over prior guidance, while at the same time, we're lowering both our capital and our operating cost guidance.
For the third quarter, we expect production to be between 1.51 million and 1.55 million barrels per day, which reflects ongoing turnaround activity in Europe and Alaska. Our project activity is on track. We're continuing to ramp up at our Surmont and FCCL projects and are progressing several other projects in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific.
We expect to complete our Senegal sale before the end of the year, and we're continuing to market our remaining deepwater exploration positions in Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. And then finally, just a reminder that we will host our 2016 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York on November 10. At that meeting, we'll provide more details on our cash flow priorities, our low cost of supply portfolio and our future investment plans. So we look forward to seeing all of you at that update. And now I'll turn it over for Q&A."

But if you look -- if you just look at our near-term performance on volumes, take -- start out with second quarter volumes, we beat the midpoint of our guidance by 26,000 barrels a day, and we're even above the high end of our range, and that was despite being -- having about a negative 15 [ph] at Surmont due to the wildfires. So you can see there that there are a lot of parts of our business that are really performing well. And the single biggest area that drove that outperformance on volumes was the Lower 48 unconventionals as you kind of see from some of the numbers we were quoting to Paul's question earlier. The decline, even running just 3 rigs in Lower 48, we're seeing better performance on the volume side and on the cost side in our Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a key driver. And then as you look toward the end of the year, the strong momentum that we're going to have on volumes -- we'll have Alder starting up, APLNG Train 2, Surmont 2 will be continuing to ramp, KBB volumes are moving up, FCCLs. So we have a lot of different projects that'll be adding volumes that give us a lot of confidence that we can continue to drive that volume performance of at least flat or even growth if we want to at these lower kind of capital levels that we've been talking about.

And what we wanted to try to tell folks is we feel comfortable with paying off the debt as it matures with the cash flow. So as we get some recovery in price and we're generating cash flow above the -- above what it takes to hold production flat and pay the dividend, we'll go ahead and put that to the balance sheet. But we're not going to spend $4 billion before we do anything else because we think we can get there over time over the next couple of years, as you say, with the natural maturities that we have on the balance sheet.

At that time, it looked -- our projection was we would drop about 10% on our Lower 48 unconventionals. With this update and with the performance we've had in the second quarter, that number's been cut roughly in half. About 6% now is what we think will be down in Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a big change, holding that same flat 3-rig rate. We've also got some improved production in Europe and in Malaysia.

Let me just start kind of with your first question sort of -- yes, we have a lot of confidence. As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital, at kind of today's inflationary rates and what's going on in the market today, we can see with our portfolio a decade of flat production at that kind of level. So with the opportunities that we have to invest in the portfolio, even at the lower capital levels, yes, we're pretty clear about what we can do over a long period of time at that kind of a level. And while that's driven by the fact that after we get APLNG up and running, second Train and we get Surmont 2 ramped up, we've got 500,000 [ph] -- we got 1/3 of our production base that's virtually no decline for the next 20 years. I think that's what's unique about our company and that's what helps us drive down this maintenance capital level or this capital to hold our production flat to the kind of level that we're seeing. Now as that translates to F&D, it's a little bit tougher question because now you're bringing the vagaries of reserves and bookings and all that kind of stuff. And that gets to be a little bit more tougher question. But generally, you're right. It has to drive F&D down from where we've been at over the last few years. But in our portfolio, where we do have a pretty high R2Ps so we are willing to let that moderate some because the bookings will not necessarily exactly follow the capital as we go forward. So reserve bookings end up being lumpy. But over time, over 3- and 5-year periods, yes, the F&D should follow. And as you're starting to book all the resources that you're developing, typically in the unconventionals, we're -- even in the Eagle Ford, we're booked to a small percentage of what we think the total resource potential will ultimately be out of Eagle Ford. So the F&D is lumpy. But generally, over time, that should happen, but there's probably some drift in R2P."

And that rolloff does provide room for it. Should we choose to increase rigs in Lower 48 next year, that rolloff money is where some of that can come from and still keep us down at these same capital levels next year.

And we've tried to tell you what we're going to do with that free cash flow in a big -- a certain, prevalent piece of that is a recognition that we need to return more to the shareholders as prices start to recover relative to where the ordinary dividend is. But I'd tell you, I think there's a lot of differentiating factors in the portfolio, the maintenance capital, keep flat production, the quality of the investment cases that we have, the low cost of supply we have in the portfolio. We'll show you that in quite a lot of detail in November. But I think there's space in this E&P world for a company like ours that is focused on returns. We know, given our size, that we can't compete against the growth of the pure play, smaller growth companies. So -- but we're going into a world of lower and high volatile prices and like having some predictability, which I think we've shown through the executions since we spun the company. We've delivered on everything we said. We know how to run the company. We know how to run this business. We know what we're doing. And as we think about that, there's space in the E&P space for a company that has differential on returns. And that can be more predictable through the cycles and do that both on the low and the upper end. And finally, we -- ever since we spun the company, we've been saying that we'll give returns back to our shareholders right off the top, and that's what we're trying to tell you here as an important part of our offering. The 20%, 30%, we recognize, needs to go to the shareholder to create discipline within the company. And that, combined with our flexible investments and what the portfolio looks like, we think, will differentiate ourselves."

I guess, we were a little bit surprised we didn't see the crude oil inventory build in the last week like it did. So we think we're in. While the supply and demand are closely balanced, it doesn't take a lot of movement on either end to create the kind of volatility that we're seeing. So as we think about it going forward, it's -- kind of be really, really cautious as we go through 2016. And it's going to take well into '17 before we see any real increases in the price. So we're -- we continue -- as Al said, we're down the hatches. We're focused on lowering the capital required to deliver the scope, and we're focused on reducing the cost and trying to get our breakeven down as low as it can possibly get because we're going to be in this world for periods of time over the next 1 year, 1.5 years."

And then the second piece is the 20% to 30% target on cash flow being paid out to shareholders that's being put above growth capital.

I realize the inflation rate is quite low today, but we're -- what we're trying to say is we're not going to be trying to increase the dividend annually to get back to somewhere like we were before we cut the dividend. So we're recognizing -- we went through the pain and the agony of the dividend decision to reset the fixed cost of the company at the lower end of the cycle. And we recognize, as we go through the middle part of the trough and to the upper end of the cycle, that's not enough return to the shareholders. So we're going to augment that with a variable distribution plan around share buyback. And while we say a lot of the -- can you be countercyclic and that kind of role? We're going to look at that pretty judiciously. We'll have a view of commodity prices today and where we think they're going over the next 3 years. We'll look at how our shares are trading in the marketplace, and we'll make a decision on what the level of share buyback is. Certainly, at a minimum, we'd like to offset the dilution that our stock programs to our employees provide so that would sort of set a floor on the share buyback. But again, I don't think there's bright lines between all of these. And as I tried to say in my comments, as the prices start to recover, we can envision doing a little bit of everything. We're going to be doing some share buyback, but we're also going to be investing in the portfolio as well. But certainly, we view giving -- making sure that we hit the 20% to 30% return to our shareholders is an important hurdle for estimate before we start investing in the portfolio."

This is a recap of our 2Q results, and Don and Al will provide more detail in a moment. But the key messages are we delivered strong operational performance, our financial performance is improving and we're making progress strategically to position ourselves for a world of lower and more volatile prices. Let me quickly go through this slide.
Production grew year-over-year by 3%. Our second quarter performance exceeded guidance despite a busy season of turnarounds and over a month of downtime at Surmont due to the wildfires. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising the midpoint of our 2016 production guidance by 2%.
We're also lowering our 2016 CapEx from $5.7 billion to $5.5 billion based on efficiency improvements really across all business lines. Our major projects across our portfolio are on track for startup as planned, and Al will talk about these projects in more detail.
Our financial performance was challenged like the rest of industry, but did improve sequentially in line with prices. 3 of 5 of our producing segments were profitable this quarter, and I think this highlights the benefit of having high-quality legacy assets in our portfolio. Cash flows were in line with expectations, and we ended the quarter with over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.
We're continuing to make progress on our asset sale program and expect to achieve our goal of about $1 billion of proceeds this year. We reduced debt by $800 million in the second quarter, so we're making progress on improving our balance sheet.
On the strategic front, we continued our phased exit of deepwater exploration. We signed an agreement to sell our position in Senegal in July and expensed our remaining deepwater position in the Gibson and Tiber wells in the Gulf of Mexico, and we drilled a successful appraisal well at Shenandoah.
Our adjusted operating costs continue to improve across the business, and we're lowering our full year guidance there as well. This will create additional cash flow momentum as prices improve. And finally, we continue to spend a lot of time analyzing the macro outlook and the choices we have for allocating cash flows through the business cycles. This is an important aspect of our value proposition and very much on the minds of investors. We've set priorities and targets that will guide our allocation decisions. By following these priorities, we can create value as prices recover and through future price cycles.
So before I turn it over to Don and Al, I want to step through our allocation priorities and targets on the next slide. The way to create value in this business is through disciplined capital allocation. On last quarter's call, I had outlined the principles of our capital allocation approach, which are shown on the left side of this slide. And as a reminder, they were that the dividend will remain a core part of our offering, and we're targeting real annual growth in that dividend.
Another principle is to maintain a strong balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of this principle. For us, that means having debt of less than $25 billion. And finally, we'll focus on disciplined growth where per-share growth will compete with absolute growth.
We have positioned the company to compete on returns. So while we have a large, low cost-of-supply portfolio, we'll be disciplined about allocating cash to volume growth. Now establishing these principles was an important first step in articulating our value proposition, especially coming out of the downturn. But we also want to set priorities and targets that will guide our incremental allocation decisions, and these are shown on the right-hand side of this slide. Let me step through them.
The first use of cash is to pay our existing dividend and invest capital to maintain our production base. Now let me be clear that flat production is not our goal. But at a minimum, we want to sustain our existing production. Because of our low decline base production, we can keep production flat for over a decade with CapEx of $5 billion to $6 billion.
Now we believe our capital intensity is now one of the lowest among our competitors, and that's a real advantage. After our cash from operations exceeds the level required to cover our dividend and CapEx for flat volumes, the next use of cash will be to grow our quarterly dividend -- our dividend annually at a real rate. We think this is a prudent and sustainable target.
Our next priority is to reduce our debt to below $25 billion. Our target is to reduce debt as it matures, but we might accelerate some of that reduction with asset sales. Our target is to have an A-rated balance sheet, which we think is a competitive advantage.
Next, we have a target to achieve 20% to 30% total shareholder payout of cash flow from operations through a combination of our ordinary dividend and flexible share repurchases. We don't believe our ordinary dividend represents enough return of capital to shareholders through the cycles for a company our size and maturity. So when we have available cash flows, we expect to return additional capital through share buybacks.
We believe this will be a differential aspect of our offering. It will also force discipline on the system while giving us a more flexible means of returning capital to our owners. And our final priority for cash flows will be to invest in our large, low cost-of-supply captured resource base. We'll allocate capital to the lowest cost-of-supply opportunities while maintaining an appropriate balance between short and medium cycle programs and we have that inventory to grow.
So what I've laid out should give you a clear sense of how we plan to create value through disciplined capital allocation. You should not think of our priorities and targets as a precise formula, but rather as a relative ranking of the choices we can exercise through the cycles. In some parts of the cycles, we can envision pulling on all these levers. At other times, we may be hunkered down. But in all parts of the cycle, we'll be disciplined.
So let me stop here. We'll have some more time for your questions in this call. We'll also provide a lot more detail on our strategy at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. But what you should take away from my comments is that we know where we're headed, and we have a strategy that is distinctive and will differentiate ConocoPhillips from our competitors.
So let me turn it over to Don for a few comments on our financial results."

I'll provide a quick overview of the second quarter financials, starting with adjusted earnings on Slide 7. The business is performing well operationally and we grew production 3%, but the low commodity price environment continues to impact financial results. For the second quarter, with an average realized price of around $28 per BOE, we reported an adjusted net loss of roughly $1 billion or $0.79 per share.
A couple of items to note that negatively impacted earnings in the quarter. We expensed our remaining position in the Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and with respect to adjusted earnings, recognized the Gibson and Tiber wells as dry holes.
We also saw higher DD&A in the quarter, and we're increasing our guidance for the year from $8.5 billion to $9.2 billion. This increase is due in part to stronger production performance, but it's also related to an increase in the DD&A rate, primarily a result of price-related reserve revisions. We continue to reduce costs across the business and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the year-ago quarter.
Second quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower-right side of this slide. While Lower 48 was impacted sequentially by higher DD&A and dry hole expenses, the remaining segments are roughly in line with expectations. As a reminder, the supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
Turning to Slide 8, I'll cover production. Our second quarter production averaged 1.546 million BOE per day, which exceeded our guidance despite the wildfires in Canada. Last year's second quarter volumes were 1.595 million BOE per day or 1.523 million when adjusted for dispositions.
Adjusting for the impact of incremental downtime, production increased by 46,000 BOE a day, representing 3% growth year-over-year. Increases in LNG and liquids volumes were partially offset by lower natural gas volumes, mostly in North America. This gets you to our 1.546 million BOE per day production for the quarter.
If you turn now to Slide 9, I'll cover the cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and have generated $1.9 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital changes. Total working capital was a use of cash of $600 million in the first half of the year. This was largely driven by reduced capital spending and lower decommissioning activity in Europe.
Since we don't expect a significant reversal of our spending trends for the remainder of 2016, we believe working capital will be a use of cash for the full year. Proceeds from asset sales, mostly North America Gas properties, were $400 million in the first half. Through the first 6 months, debt increased by $3.8 billion. This reflects the $4.6 billion debt raised in the first quarter, offset by $800 million of commercial paper retired in the second quarter. Capital spending for the first half of the year was $3 billion. And after dividend payments of $600 million and some other small items, we ended June with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to run through our operational performance."

I'll go through our operations by segment and then provide a brief overview of what's left to watch for in the second half of the year, and then we could take your questions.
If you turn to Slide 11, I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments. In the Lower 48, our production in the second quarter was 503,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying decrease of 17,000 barrels a day compared to this time last year.
The unconventionals produced 262,000 barrels per day or down 4% from second quarter of 2015. That's a better performance than we had expected, driven primarily by better well performance in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, but also by the lag effects from our ramp-down in rig activity. Now that we're running with 3 rigs, we expect decline in the unconventionals to steepen somewhat in the second half of the year. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw successful results at the latest Shenandoah 5 appraisal well, which encountered over 1,000 feet of net pay.
Moving to Canada, our production was 279,000 barrels per day. Adjusted for dispositions, we saw growth compared to the second quarter of last year, even including the wildfire impacts at Surmont. That's the result of ongoing ramp-up of our oil sands projects, which provided a 16% increase in bitumen production compared to this time last year. We expect growth to continue as Surmont 2 ramps up to full capacity through 2017 and we bring additional phases online at FCCL. We also achieved first production with the commissioning of the Foster Creek Phase G during the second quarter, and we're progressing toward first production at Christina Lake Phase F.
Moving to Slide 12, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. In Alaska, we saw growth compared to the same time last year, with second quarter production of 179,000 barrels per day. This came from ongoing strong production at CD5 and Drill Site 2S. In the quarter, we also approved an expansion phase of CD5, which will add an additional 16 wells and bring CD5 to its full design capacity. We have significant turnaround activity planned in Alaska for the third quarter at both Kuparuk and Alpine. And finally, we completed the sale of our Beluga River asset in the Cook Inlet during the quarter.
In Europe and North Africa, production of 187,000 barrels per day was down 20,000 barrels per day compared to the same period last year. That decrease is primarily the result of increased turnaround activity in this year's second quarter. In the U.K., at Clair Ridge, the drilling and production modules were successfully installed, and progress is also continuing at Alder where we expect to achieve first reduction in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll cover the Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International segments. In APME, production was 398,000 barrels per day, up 14% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the ongoing ramp-up at APLNG. Train 1 is continuing to run ahead of expectations with 27 cargoes loaded in the first half of the year, including our first cargo to Kansai Electric in Japan. We're on track to deliver the first cargo from Train 2 in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In Malaysia, Gumusut's continuing to produce at a high level, and third-party pipeline commissioning is underway at KBB, so we're beginning to see increased production volumes there as well. And the sailaway of the Malikai TLP was completed this month, with startup expected next year. In the Other International segment, the key milestone was signing the SPA for the sale of our exploration blocks in Senegal in July. This sale is expected to generate proceeds of $400 million to $450 million.
If you turn to Slide 14, I'll provide a few comments about our outlook for the rest of the year. As Ryan and Don mentioned, the business has performed well through the first half of the year. We're updating our full year production guidance to 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels per day. That's an increase of 35,000 barrels per day or about 2% over prior guidance, while at the same time, we're lowering both our capital and our operating cost guidance.
For the third quarter, we expect production to be between 1.51 million and 1.55 million barrels per day, which reflects ongoing turnaround activity in Europe and Alaska. Our project activity is on track. We're continuing to ramp up at our Surmont and FCCL projects and are progressing several other projects in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific.
We expect to complete our Senegal sale before the end of the year, and we're continuing to market our remaining deepwater exploration positions in Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. And then finally, just a reminder that we will host our 2016 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York on November 10. At that meeting, we'll provide more details on our cash flow priorities, our low cost-of-supply portfolio and our future investment plans. So we look forward to seeing all of you at that update. And now I'll turn it over for Q&A."

So I mean, you've heard a lot from us over the last few years about the shift that we've had from megaprojects, longer cycle to shorter cycle, more flexible investment, that's really standing us in good stead now. But if you look -- if you just look at our near-term performance on volumes, take -- start out with second quarter volumes, we beat the midpoint of our guidance by 26,000 barrels a day, and we're even above the high end of our range, and that was despite being -- having about a negative 15 [ph] at Surmont due to the wildfires. So you can see there that there are a lot of parts of our business that are really performing well. And the single biggest area that drove that outperformance on volumes was the Lower 48 unconventionals, as you kind of see from some of the numbers we were quoting to Paul's question earlier. The decline, even running just 3 rigs in the Lower 48, we're seeing better performance on the volume side and on the cost side in our Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a key driver. And then as you look toward the end of the year, the strong momentum that we're going to have on volumes -- we'll have Alder starting up, APLNG Train 2, Surmont 2 will be continuing to ramp, KBB volumes are moving up, FCCL. So we have a lot of different projects that'll be adding volumes that give us a lot of confidence that we can continue to drive that volume performance of at least flat or even growth if we want to at these lower kind of capital levels that we've been talking about.

And what we wanted to try to tell folks is we feel comfortable with paying off the debt as it matures with the cash flow. So as we get some recovery in price and we're generating cash flow above the -- above what it takes to hold production flat and pay the dividend, we'll go ahead and put that to the balance sheet. But we're not going to spend $4 billion before we do anything else because we think we can get there over time over the next couple of years, as you say, with the natural maturities that we have on the balance sheet. And then we know we want to get back into the market with some asset sales when the market starts recovering. So we know that we'll be selling some more of our noncore assets, and we'll always have that to help us accelerate that debt repayment. But the main message, it's manageable.

At that time, it looked -- our projection was we would drop about 10% on our Lower 48 unconventionals. With this update and with the performance we've had in the second quarter, that number's been cut roughly in half. About 6% now is what we think we'll be down in Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a big change, holding that same flat 3-rig rate. We've also got some improved production in Europe and in Malaysia. And so really, if you think about it, those are all above-average-margin barrels for us.

Let me just start kind of with your first question sort of -- yes, we have a lot of confidence. As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital, at kind of today's inflationary rates and what's going on",369,"Yes, there's quite a lot in that, Guy. Let me just start kind of with your first question sort of -- yes, we have a lot of confidence. As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital, at kind of today's inflationary rates and what's going on in the market today, we can see with our portfolio a decade of flat production at that kind of level. So with the opportunities that we have to invest in the portfolio, even at the lower capital levels, yes, we're pretty clear about what we can do over a long period of time at that kind of a level. And a lot of that's driven by the fact that after we get APLNG up and running, second Train and we get Surmont 2 ramped up, we've got 500,000 -- we got 1/3 of our production base that's virtually no decline for the next 20 years. I think that's what's unique about our company and that's what helps us drive down this maintenance capital level or this capital to hold our production flat to the kind of level that we're seeing. Now as that translates to F&D, it's a little bit tougher question because now you're bringing in the vagaries of reserves and bookings and all that kind of stuff. And that gets to be a little bit more tougher question. But generally, you're right. It has to drive F&D down from where we've been at over the last few years. But in our portfolio, where we do have a pretty high R2P, so we are willing to let that moderate some because the bookings will not necessarily exactly follow the capital as we go forward. So reserve bookings end up being lumpy. But over time, over 3- and 5-year periods, yes, the F&D should follow. And as you're starting to book all the resources that you're developing, typically in the unconventionals, we're -- even in the Eagle Ford, we're booked to a small percentage of what we think the total resource potential will ultimately be out of Eagle Ford. So the F&D is lumpy. But generally, over time, that should happen, but there's probably some drift in R2P."

And that roll-off does provide room for us. Should we choose to increase rigs in Lower 48 next year, that roll-off money is where some of that can come from and still keep us down at these same capital levels next year.

Of course, the deflation is a piece of this and we're trying to hang onto that as -- get as much of that as we can along the way and hang on to it for as long as we can.

I know one of the pushbacks that you often get from investors is that Conoco is kind of stuck in the middle. For some who look at you as a major, they'll say you have a low yield. And for some that are looking at you as an E&P, they'll be more focused on growth. Is the message on that slide and going into the Analyst Day that the most powerful differentiating factor is the free cash flow? Is that what you see as the most powerful unique value proposition point?"

And we've tried to tell you what we're going to do with that free cash flow, and to be certain, a prevalent piece of that is a recognition that we need to return more to the shareholders as prices start to recover relative to where the ordinary dividend is. But I'd tell you, I think there's a lot of differentiating factors in the portfolio, the maintenance capital to keep flat production, the quality of the investment cases that we have, the low cost of supply we have in the portfolio. We'll show you that in quite a lot of detail in November. But I think there's space in this E&P world for a company like ours that is focused on returns. We know, given our size, that we can't compete against the growth of the pure play, smaller growth companies. So -- but we're going into a world of lower and high volatile prices. And having some predictability, which I think we've shown through the execution since we spun the company. We've delivered on everything we said. We know how to run the company. We know how to run this business. We know what we're doing. And as we think about that, there's space in the E&P space for a company that is differential on returns and that can be more predictable through the cycles, and do that both on the low and the upper end. And finally, we -- ever since we spun the company, we've been saying that we'll give returns back to our shareholders right off the top, and that's what we're trying to tell you here. It's an important part of our offering. The 20%, 30% we recognize needs to go to the shareholder to create discipline within the company. And that, combined with our flexible investments and what the portfolio looks like, we think will differentiate ourselves."

I guess we were a little bit surprised to even see the crude oil inventory build in the last week like it did. So we think we're in -- while the supply and demand are closely balanced, it doesn't take a lot of movement on either end to create the kind of volatility that we're seeing. So as we think about it going forward, it's kind of be really, really cautious as we go through 2016. And it's going to take well into '17 before we see any real increases in the price. So we're -- we continue -- as Al said, we're battening down the hatches. We're focused on lowering the capital required to deliver the scope, and we're focused on reducing the cost and trying to get our breakeven down as low as it can possibly get because we're going to be in this world for periods of time over the next 1 year, 1.5 years."

I don't mean to be pedantic with it, but I just wanted to clarify that. And then the second piece is the 20% to 30% target on cash flow being paid out to shareholders. That's being put above growth capital. So is it fair to think that the buybacks are going to take priority over reinvesting? In other words, CapEx will remain at the $5 billion to $6 billion level until you've begun doing some buybacks?"

I realize the inflation rate is quite low today, but we're -- what we're trying to say is we're not going to be trying to increase the dividend annually to get back to somewhere like we were before we cut the dividend. So we're recognizing we went through the pain and the agony of the dividend decision to reset the fixed cost of the company at the lower end of the cycle. And we recognize, as we go through the middle part of the trough and to the upper end of the cycle, that's not enough return to the shareholders. So we're going to augment that with a variable distribution plan around share buyback. And while we say a lot of the -- can you be countercyclic in that kind of world? We're going to look at that pretty judiciously. We'll have a view of commodity prices today and where we think they're going over the next 3 years. We'll look at how our shares are trading in the marketplace, and we'll make a decision on what the level of share buyback is. Certainly, at a minimum, we'd like to offset the dilution that our stock programs to our employees provide, so that would sort of set a floor on the share buyback. But again, I don't think there's bright lines between all of these. And as I tried to say in my comments, as the prices start to recover, we can envision doing a little bit of everything. We're going to be doing some share buyback, but we're also going to be investing in the portfolio as well. But certainly, we view giving -- making sure that we hit the 20% to 30% return to our shareholders is an important hurdle for us to make before we start investing in the portfolio."

This is a recap of our 2Q results, and Don and Al will provide more detail in a moment. But the key messages are we delivered strong operational performance, our financial performance is improving and we're making progress strategically to position ourselves for a world of lower and more volatile prices. Let me quickly go through this slide.
Production grew year-over-year by 3%. Our second quarter performance exceeded guidance despite a busy season of turnarounds and over a month of downtime at Surmont due to the wildfires. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising the midpoint of our 2016 production guidance by 2%.
We're also lowering our 2016 CapEx from $5.7 billion to $5.5 billion based on efficiency improvements really across all business lines. Our major projects across our portfolio are on track for startup as planned, and Al will talk about these projects in more detail.
Our financial performance was challenged like the rest of industry, but did improve sequentially in line with prices. 3 of 5 of our producing segments were profitable this quarter, and I think this highlights the benefit of having high-quality legacy assets in our portfolio. Cash flows were in line with expectations, and we ended the quarter with over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.
We're continuing to make progress on our asset sale program and expect to achieve our goal of about $1 billion of proceeds this year. We reduced debt by $800 million in the second quarter, so we're making progress on improving our balance sheet.
On the strategic front, we continued our phased exit of deepwater exploration. We signed an agreement to sell our position in Senegal in July and expensed our remaining deepwater position in the Gibson and Tiber wells in the Gulf of Mexico, and we drilled a successful appraisal well at Shenandoah.
Our adjusted operating costs continue to improve across the business, and we're lowering our full year guidance there as well. This will create additional cash flow momentum as prices improve. And finally, we continue to spend a lot of time analyzing the macro outlook and the choices we have for allocating cash flows through the business cycles. This is an important aspect of our value proposition and very much on the minds of investors. We've set priorities and targets that will guide our allocation decisions. By following these priorities, we can create value as prices recover and through future price cycles.
So before I turn it over to Don and Al, I want to step through our allocation priorities and targets on the next slide. The way to create value in this business is through disciplined capital allocation. On last quarter's call, I had outlined the principles of our capital allocation approach, which are shown on the left side of this slide. And as a reminder, they were that the dividend will remain a core part of our offering, and we're targeting real annual growth in that dividend.
Another principle is to maintain a strong balance sheet. The recent downturn has emphasized the importance of this principle. For us, that means having debt of less than $25 billion. And finally, we'll focus on disciplined growth where per share growth will compete with absolute growth.
We have positioned the company to compete on returns. So while we have a large, low cost of supply portfolio, we'll be disciplined about allocating cash to volume growth. Now establishing these principles was an important first step in articulating our value proposition, especially coming out of the downturn. But we also want to set priorities and targets that will guide our incremental allocation decisions, and these are shown on the right-hand side of this slide. Let me step through them.
The first use of cash is to pay our existing dividend and invest capital to maintain our production base. Now let me be clear that flat production is not our goal. But at a minimum, we want to sustain our existing production. Because of our low decline base production, we can keep production flat for over a decade with CapEx of $5 billion to $6 billion.
Now we believe our capital intensity is now one of the lowest among our competitors, and that's a real advantage. After our cash from operations exceeds the level required to cover our dividend and CapEx for flat volumes, the next use of cash will be to grow our quarterly dividend -- our dividend annually at a real rate. We think this is a prudent and sustainable target.
Our next priority is to reduce our debt to below $25 billion. Our target is to reduce debt as it matures, but we might accelerate some of that reduction with asset sales. Our target is to have an A-rated balance sheet, which we think is a competitive advantage.
Next, we have a target to achieve 20% to 30% total shareholder payout of cash flow from operations through a combination of our ordinary dividend and flexible share repurchases. We don't believe our ordinary dividend represents enough return of capital to shareholders through the cycles for a company our size and maturity. So when we have available cash flows, we expect to return additional capital through share buybacks.
We believe this will be a differential aspect of our offering. It will also force discipline on the system while giving us a more flexible means of returning capital to our owners. And our final priority for cash flows will be to invest in our large, low cost of supply captured resource base. We'll allocate capital to the lowest cost of supply opportunities while maintaining an appropriate balance between short and medium cycle programs and we have that inventory to grow.
So what I've laid out should give you a clear sense of how we plan to create value through disciplined capital allocation. You should not think of our priorities and targets as a precise formula, but rather as a relative ranking of the choices we can exercise through the cycles. In some parts of the cycles, we can envision pulling on all these levers. At other times, we may be hunkered down. But in all parts of the cycle, we'll be disciplined.
So let me stop here. We'll have some more time for your questions in this call. We'll also provide a lot more detail on our strategy at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. But what you should take away from my comments is that we know where we're headed, and we have a strategy that is distinctive and will differentiate ConocoPhillips from our competitors.
So let me turn it over to Don for a few comments on our financial results."

I'll provide a quick overview of the second quarter financials, starting with adjusted earnings on Slide 7. The business is performing well operationally and we grew production 3%, but the low commodity price environment continues to impact financial results. For the second quarter, with an average realized price of around $28 per BOE, we reported an adjusted net loss of roughly $1 billion or $0.79 per share.
A couple of items to note that negatively impacted earnings in the quarter. We expensed our remaining position in the Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and with respect to adjusted earnings, recognized the Gibson and Tiber wells as dry holes.
We also saw higher DD&A in the quarter, and we're increasing our guidance for the year from $8.5 billion to $9.2 billion. This increase is due in part to stronger production performance, but it's also related to an increase in the DD&A rate, primarily a result of price-related reserve revisions. We continue to reduce costs across the business and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the year-ago quarter.
Second quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower-right side of this slide. While Lower 48 was impacted sequentially by higher DD&A and dry hole expenses, the remaining segments are roughly in line with expectations. As a reminder, the supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
Turning to Slide 8, I'll cover production. Our second quarter production averaged 1.546 million BOE per day, which exceeded our guidance despite the wildfires in Canada. Last year's second quarter volumes were 1.595 million BOE per day or 1.523 million when adjusted for dispositions.
Adjusting for the impact of incremental downtime, production increased by 46,000 BOE a day, representing 3% growth year-over-year. Increases in LNG and liquids volumes were partially offset by lower natural gas volumes, mostly in North America. This gets you to our 1.546 million BOE per day production for the quarter.
If you turn now to Slide 9, I'll cover the cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash and have generated $1.9 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital changes. Total working capital was a use of cash of $600 million in the first half of the year. This was largely driven by reduced capital spending and lower decommissioning activity in Europe.
Since we don't expect a significant reversal of our spending trends for the remainder of 2016, we believe working capital will be a use of cash for the full year. Proceeds from asset sales, mostly North America Gas properties, were $400 million in the first half. Through the first 6 months, debt increased by $3.8 billion. This reflects the $4.6 billion debt raised in the first quarter, offset by $800 million of commercial paper retired in the second quarter. Capital spending for the first half of the year was $3 billion. And after dividend payments of $600 million and some other small items, we ended June with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to run through our operational performance."

I'll go through our operations by segment and then provide a brief overview of what's left to watch for in the second half of the year, and then we could take your questions.
If you turn to Slide 11, I'll start with the Lower 48 and Canada segments. In the Lower 48, our production in the second quarter was 503,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales, that's an underlying decrease of 17,000 barrels a day compared to this time last year.
The unconventionals produced 262,000 barrels per day or down 4% from second quarter of 2015. That's a better performance than we had expected, driven primarily by better well performance in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, but also by the lag effects from our ramp down in rig activity. Now that we're running with 3 rigs, we expect decline in the unconventionals to steepen somewhat in the second half of the year. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw successful results at the latest Shenandoah 5 appraisal well, which encountered over 1,000 feet of net pay.
Moving to Canada, our production was 279,000 barrels per day. Adjusted for dispositions, we saw growth compared to the second quarter of last year, even including the wildfire impacts at Surmont. That's the result of ongoing ramp-up of our oil sands projects, which provided a 16% increase in bitumen production compared to this time last year. We expect growth to continue as Surmont 2 ramps up to full capacity through 2017 and we bring additional phases online at FCCL. We also achieved first production with the commissioning of the Foster Creek Phase G during the second quarter, and we're progressing toward first production at Christina Lake Phase F.
Moving to Slide 12, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. In Alaska, we saw growth compared to the same time last year, with second quarter production of 179,000 barrels per day. This came from ongoing strong production at CD5 and Drill Site 2S. In the quarter, we also approved an expansion phase of CD5, which will add an additional 16 wells and bring CD5 to its full design capacity. We have significant turnaround activity planned in Alaska for the third quarter at both Kuparuk and Alpine. And finally, we completed the sale of our Beluga River asset in the Cook Inlet during the quarter.
In Europe and North Africa, production of 187,000 barrels per day was down 20,000 barrels per day compared to the same period last year. That decrease is primarily the result of increased turnaround activity in this year's second quarter. In the U.K., at Clair Ridge, the drilling and production modules were successfully installed, and progress is also continuing at Alder where we expect to achieve first reduction in the fourth quarter.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll cover the Asia Pacific and Middle East and Other International segments. In APME, production was 398,000 barrels per day, up 14% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the ongoing ramp-up at APLNG. Train 1 is continuing to run ahead of expectations with 27 cargoes loaded in the first half of the year, including our first cargo to Kansai Electric in Japan. We're on track to deliver the first cargo from Train 2 in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In Malaysia, Gumusut's continuing to produce at a high level, and third-party pipeline commissioning is underway at KBB, so we're beginning to see increased production volumes there as well. And the sailaway of the Malikai TLP was completed this month, with startup expected next year. In the Other International segment, the key milestone was signing the SPA for the sale of our exploration blocks in Senegal in July. This sale is expected to generate proceeds of $400 million to $450 million.
If you turn to Slide 14, I'll provide a few comments about our outlook for the rest of the year. As Ryan and Don mentioned, the business has performed well through the first half of the year. We're updating our full year production guidance to 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels per day. That's an increase of 35,000 barrels per day or about 2% over prior guidance, while at the same time, we're lowering both our capital and our operating cost guidance.
For the third quarter, we expect production to be between 1.51 million and 1.55 million barrels per day, which reflects ongoing turnaround activity in Europe and Alaska. Our project activity is on track. We're continuing to ramp up at our Surmont and FCCL projects and are progressing several other projects in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific.
We expect to complete our Senegal sale before the end of the year, and we're continuing to market our remaining deepwater exploration positions in Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. And then finally, just a reminder that we will host our 2016 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York on November 10. At that meeting, we'll provide more details on our cash flow priorities, our low cost of supply portfolio and our future investment plans. So we look forward to seeing all of you at that update. And now I'll turn it over for Q&A."

So we recognize that as prices recover, that's not enough payout to the shareholders. Even when we spun the company, we were talking about these kinds of payout levels. We were doing that with the -- just the ordinary dividend at the time. So we set a pretty broad range, 20% to 30%. And clearly, we'll take a look at that as the circumstances warrant and then compare really -- as you get down to those fourth and fifth priorities, it's about what kind of investments do we have that the shareholders would want us to be making in the portfolio?

But if you look -- if you just look at our near-term performance on volumes, take -- start out with second quarter volumes, we beat the midpoint of our guidance by 26,000 barrels a day, and we're even above the high end of our range, and that was despite being -- having about a negative 15 [ph] at Surmont due to the wildfires. So you can see there that there are a lot of parts of our business that are really performing well. And the single biggest area that drove that outperformance on volumes was the Lower 48 unconventionals, as you kind of see from some of the numbers we were quoting to Paul's question earlier. The decline, even running just 3 rigs in the Lower 48, we're seeing better performance on the volume side and on the cost side in our Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a key driver. And then as you look toward the end of the year, the strong momentum that we're going to have on volumes -- we'll have Alder starting up, APLNG Train 2, Surmont 2 will be continuing to ramp, KBB volumes are moving up, FCCL. So we have a lot of different projects that'll be adding volumes that give us a lot of confidence that we can continue to drive that volume performance of at least flat or even growth if we want to at these lower kind of capital levels that we've been talking about.

And what we wanted to try to tell folks is we feel comfortable with paying off the debt as it matures with the cash flow. So as we get some recovery in price and we're generating cash flow above the -- above what it takes to hold production flat and pay the dividend, we'll go ahead and put that to the balance sheet. But we're not going to spend $4 billion before we do anything else because we think we can get there over time over the next couple of years, as you say, with the natural maturities that we have on the balance sheet. And then we know we want to get back into the market with some asset sales when the market starts recovering. So we know that we'll be selling some more of our noncore assets, and we'll always have that to help us accelerate that debt repayment. But the main message, it's manageable.

At that time, it looked -- our projection was we would drop about 10% on our Lower 48 unconventionals. With this update and with the performance we've had in the second quarter, that number's been cut roughly in half. About 6% now is what we think we'll be down in Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a big change, holding that same flat 3-rig rate. We've also got some improved production in Europe and in Malaysia.

As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital, at kind of today's inflationary rates and what's going on",369,"Yes, there's quite a lot in that, Guy. Let me just start kind of with your first question sort of -- yes, we have a lot of confidence. As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital, at kind of today's inflationary rates and what's going on in the market today, we can see with our portfolio a decade of flat production at that kind of level. So with the opportunities that we have to invest in the portfolio, even at the lower capital levels, yes, we're pretty clear about what we can do over a long period of time at that kind of a level. And a lot of that's driven by the fact that after we get APLNG up and running, second Train and we get Surmont 2 ramped up, we've got 500,000 -- we got 1/3 of our production base that's virtually no decline for the next 20 years. I think that's what's unique about our company and that's what helps us drive down this maintenance capital level or this capital to hold our production flat to the kind of level that we're seeing. Now as that translates to F&D, it's a little bit tougher question because now you're bringing in the vagaries of reserves and bookings and all that kind of stuff. And that gets to be a little bit more tougher question. But generally, you're right. It has to drive F&D down from where we've been at over the last few years. But in our portfolio, where we do have a pretty high R2P, so we are willing to let that moderate some because the bookings will not necessarily exactly follow the capital as we go forward. So reserve bookings end up being lumpy. But over time, over 3- and 5-year periods, yes, the F&D should follow. And as you're starting to book all the resources that you're developing, typically in the unconventionals, we're -- even in the Eagle Ford, we're booked to a small percentage of what we think the total resource potential will ultimately be out of Eagle Ford. So the F&D is lumpy. But generally, over time, that should happen, but there's probably some drift in R2P."

And that roll-off does provide room for us. Should we choose to increase rigs in Lower 48 next year, that roll-off money is where some of that can come from and still keep us down at these same capital levels next year.

And we've tried to tell you what we're going to do with that free cash flow, and to be certain, a prevalent piece of that is a recognition that we need to return more to the shareholders as prices start to recover relative to where the ordinary dividend is. But I'd tell you, I think there's a lot of differentiating factors in the portfolio, the maintenance capital to keep flat production, the quality of the investment cases that we have, the low cost of supply we have in the portfolio. We'll show you that in quite a lot of detail in November. But I think there's space in this E&P world for a company like ours that is focused on returns. We know, given our size, that we can't compete against the growth of the pure play, smaller growth companies. So -- but we're going into a world of lower and high volatile prices. And having some predictability, which I think we've shown through the execution since we spun the company. We've delivered on everything we said. We know how to run the company. We know how to run this business. We know what we're doing. And as we think about that, there's space in the E&P space for a company that is differential on returns and that can be more predictable through the cycles, and do that both on the low and the upper end. And finally, we -- ever since we spun the company, we've been saying that we'll give returns back to our shareholders right off the top, and that's what we're trying to tell you here. It's an important part of our offering. The 20%, 30% we recognize needs to go to the shareholder to create discipline within the company. And that, combined with our flexible investments and what the portfolio looks like, we think will differentiate ourselves."

I guess we were a little bit surprised to even see the crude oil inventory build in the last week like it did. So we think we're in -- while the supply and demand are closely balanced, it doesn't take a lot of movement on either end to create the kind of volatility that we're seeing. So as we think about it going forward, it's kind of be really, really cautious as we go through 2016. And it's going to take well into '17 before we see any real increases in the price. So we're -- we continue -- as Al said, we're battening down the hatches. We're focused on lowering the capital required to deliver the scope, and we're focused on reducing the cost and trying to get our breakeven down as low as it can possibly get because we're going to be in this world for periods of time over the next 1 year, 1.5 years."

I don't mean to be pedantic with it, but I just wanted to clarify that. And then the second piece is the 20% to 30% target on cash flow being paid out to shareholders. That's being put above growth capital. So is it fair to think that the buybacks are going to take priority over reinvesting? In other words, CapEx will remain at the $5 billion to $6 billion level until you've begun doing some buybacks?"

I realize the inflation rate is quite low today, but we're -- what we're trying to say is we're not going to be trying to increase the dividend annually to get back to somewhere like we were before we cut the dividend. So we're recognizing we went through the pain and the agony of the dividend decision to reset the fixed cost of the company at the lower end of the cycle. And we recognize, as we go through the middle part of the trough and to the upper end of the cycle, that's not enough return to the shareholders. So we're going to augment that with a variable distribution plan around share buyback. And while we say a lot of the -- can you be countercyclic in that kind of world? We're going to look at that pretty judiciously. We'll have a view of commodity prices today and where we think they're going over the next 3 years. We'll look at how our shares are trading in the marketplace, and we'll make a decision on what the level of share buyback is. Certainly, at a minimum, we'd like to offset the dilution that our stock programs to our employees provide, so that would sort of set a floor on the share buyback. But again, I don't think there's bright lines between all of these. And as I tried to say in my comments, as the prices start to recover, we can envision doing a little bit of everything. We're going to be doing some share buyback, but we're also going to be investing in the portfolio as well. But certainly, we view giving -- making sure that we hit the 20% to 30% return to our shareholders is an important hurdle for us to make before we start investing in the portfolio."

Our cautionary statement is shown on Page 2 of today's presentation. We will make some forward-looking statements during today's call that refers to estimates and plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors noted on this slide and in our periodic SEC filings. 
We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today. These help facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. For any non-GAAP measures that we use, we'll provide a reconciliation -- we provided a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure that can also be found on our website. 
One final note before we jump in, as most of you know, ConocoPhillips will hold our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10. That's just around the corner. At that time, we'll provide an update on our strategy and our 2017 operating plan, so we will not be addressing those topics on today's call.

I'll start by covering a few highlights from the third quarter, and Al will close with more on our operational results and what to watch for through the remainder of the year. 
I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of the third quarter.
We had a strong operational quarter and again exceeded the high end of our production guidance range, delivering 4% underlying growth -- production growth year-over-year. We safely completed an active turnaround season and achieved a major milestone with the startup of Train 2 at APLNG. 
Financially, we had an adjusted net loss of $826 million. We generated $1.23 billion of operating cash flow, excluding working capital. It's notable that during the third quarter, operating cash flows covered capital spending and dividends.
Cash flow in the quarter was also negatively impacted by about $230 million from special items related to rig termination costs and severance expenses. So if you take the clean number and adjust it to today's prices of about $50 a barrel, then on an annualized basis, that would be about $6.5 billion of operating cash flow, which is about what we would expect. Again, sufficient to cover sustaining capital and dividends.
Looking at operating cost, we continue to drive cost down and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the third quarter of 2015. Most of these reductions are structural and continue to lower the overall breakeven price of our business.
With respect to strategic objectives, in July, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our 3 exploration blocks offshore Senegal, which is part of our ongoing exit from deepwater exploration. We also reached agreement on the sale of our Block B assets in Indonesia. We expect both of these sales to close before the end of the year.
Earlier this month, we retired $1.25 billion of maturing debt and expect to end the year with debt a little over $27 billion. I'll go through our third quarter financial results on Slide 5.
While we operated well this quarter, low commodity prices continued to impact financial results. For the quarter, with an average realized price just under $30 per barrel, we reported an adjusted loss of $826 million or $0.66 per share. 
Year-over-year, adjusted earnings decreased as the result of a 9% drop in realized prices and lower equity affiliate earnings. Sequentially, adjusted earnings benefited from a 7% improvement in realized prices, mainly driven by improved North America natural gas prices as well as higher contract LNG prices.
Third quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide and are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
I'll cover production on Slide 6. Last year's third quarter volumes were 1,554 MBOE per day or 1,484 MBOE a day when adjusted for dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of less downtime, production increased by 56 MBOE a day, representing 4% year-over-year growth. That increase came primarily from higher volumes at APLNG and in the Canadian oil sands. Those increases were partially offset by a 28,000 BOE per day decrease in natural gas, primarily in North America, bringing us to the 1,557 for the third quarter. Al will provide more color on third quarter operating performance. 
If you turn to Slide 7, I'll cover year-to-date cash flow. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date, we generated $3.1 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital. Total working capital has been a use of cash of $600 million. Proceeds from asset sales have generated $400 million. Debt has increased by $3.8 billion but this number will decrease for the full year once we include the $1.25 billion repayment we made in October. Capital spending year-to-date has been $3.9 billion, and after dividend payments of around $900 million, we ended September with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.
So financially, we are very well-positioned. We've made good progress on driving the business to cash flow neutrality and on improving our balance sheet since the first quarter. I look forward to providing more detail on our financial plans next month in New York.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to take you through our operational performance."

I'll provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating highlights starting on Slide 9. Then I'll provide some additional thoughts for the rest of the year, including updated guidance for capital and adjusted operating cost.
Third quarter production averaged 1,557 MBOED, which exceeded the high end of guidance. The beat was driven by better-than-expected performance in Canada, Norway, Lower 48 unconventionals and Malaysia. We completed some significant turnaround activities in Alaska and Europe during the quarter, which brings an end to our major turnarounds for the year. 
We continue to see some production resiliency in the Lower 48 unconventionals despite the fact that we've been running only 3 rigs for the majority of the year, although we do expect more decline in the fourth quarter. 
Now that APLNG Train 2 has started up, the major project capital roll-off that we have been experiencing is essentially complete, so we've been working to shift more of our capital spending to the Lower 48 unconventionals. We've already been able to secure drilling rigs and pressure pumping crews at attractive rates to maintain our low cost of supply, so we expect this incremental drilling work to start ramping in November. This work will have no impact on 2016 volumes but will give us a headstart on our 2017 production.
In Canada, Surmont fully recovered from the impact of the wildfires earlier this year and achieved a milestone of more than 100,000 barrels a day of gross production in mid-October. We're on track to exit this year at over 110,000 barrels a day gross as we continue to increase toward our 150,000 barrels a day gross capacity. 
In Australia, we achieved first production from Train 2 at APLNG in September and have again experienced a very smooth startup, which allowed us to begin delivering cargoes with Train 2 LNG in early October. 
We also have several conventional projects underway across the portfolio that are expected to come on production over the next couple of years: Alder and Clair Ridge in the U.K.; Aasta Hansteen in Norway; Malikai in Malaysia; and additional phases at Bohai in China; as well as GMT1 and 1H NEWS in Alaska.
So moving to Slide 10, I'll provide an update of our 2016 full year guidance. For the second quarter in a row, we've hit the trifecta. We increased production guidance based on robust production year-to-date while at the same time lowering both capital and adjusted operating cost guidance. We're driving strong execution and are focused on improving every aspect of our business, and we're not done with our improvements. There's more to come. 
We've revised full year production guidance to a range of 1,560 MBOED to 1,570 MBOED. That's up 10,000 barrels a day from prior guidance at the midpoint, reflecting our strong third quarter performance. 
Fourth quarter production guidance is 1,555 MBOED to 1,595 MBOED. We're lowering our capital guidance by $300 million from $5.5 billion to $5.2 billion, even though we're beginning to add rigs in Lower 48, as I just mentioned. 
Our efforts to reduce operating costs across the business are also succeeding. We're lowering our adjusted operating cost guidance by $200 million from $6.8 billion to $6.6 billion. 
As you can tell, we're continuing to improve the company's breakeven price and deliver strong momentum going into 2017. So that was a very quick recap of the third quarter. We look forward to giving you a deep dive of our portfolio and providing our 2017 operating plan at our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10. 
So now, I'll turn the call over for Q&A related to the quarter."

And some of that, I've said in the past, will roll into some other mid-cycle type projects that are coming up, and the rest will tend to roll in the Lower 48 unconventionals. So I do expect that a fair chunk of that is going to go into Lower 48 unconventionals in the -- in 2017. And that's what you see as kind of starting now, as that work has rolled off, we've gotten ourselves ready.

All right. Well, I'll let you take that one over for this quarter. Well, the first part of your question, the turnarounds where we had some pluses and minuses overall, quite successful operationally and came about right about on target, so less than 1,000 barrels a day delta from turnaround actuals versus what we had expected. The increase really has been driven by the Lower 48 unconventional by Canada, the oil sands side there, by stronger well performance in Norway and KBB in Malaysia, some better volumes there. Those have been the biggest pieces. A little bit in Alaska as well with the continuing outperformance from CD5. So it's been -- if I had to put a headline across all of that, I would say it's been really well performance and uptime beyond not so much that planned downtime, but our plan -- our unplanned downtime has been performing better than expected. So uptime has given us a little boost, but primarily, just well performance. In terms of the -- let me give you the actual numbers on the -- first, if you look at the total Lower 48 unconventional, last quarter, we were at 262,000 in the second quarter. Third quarter came in at 259,000, so down 3,000 barrels a day. The 3 big pieces of that, just because we got to get Paul Chang's full question in here, Eagle Ford was 171,000 in the second quarter, it was down 8,000 to 163,000. The Bakken went from 64,000 in the second quarter to 61,000 in the third quarter, down 3,000. And then, the Permian was an offset. It was plus 8,000. The Permian shale went from 13,000 to 21,000 for a plus 8,000. So that -- and everything else was flat, our other unconventional Lower 48. So that's why the total added up to minus 3,000, minus 8,000 in Eagle Ford offset by a plus 8,000 in Permian and a minus 3,000 in Bakken."

So where we're headed next there is that we're now -- we're focused on the upstream side on ramping our gas supply to be able to run both trains at full capacity. We're not at that point yet. I expect it will be sometime in the second quarter before we have enough gas supply from the upstream side to be able to run both trains at full tilt. And that's when we'll be looking to do our Train 2 lenders' test. And we've completed the lenders' test on Train 1. Train 2, tentatively, thinking around May or so that we'd be in a position to run that test. Just to give you an idea, year-to-date, we've now shipped over 50 cargoes from APLNG."

We will be looking to add rigs in our Permian acreage in 2017 but that's not part of this late '16 effort. On the Bakken, we've been fairly steady there on our progress in terms of recoveries and costs. But recently, we've put a new completion design in place, and we're going to talk more about it our Investor Day, and so we're really pretty excited. That's part of why we're eager to get some rigs back to work in the Bakken. In the Eagle Ford, if you look at our cost of supply there, we've got such a huge segment that's got down and below $25 fully burdened cost supply, single well cost supply in the mid-teens. And so who wouldn't want to go run more rigs there in the Eagle Ford? And so that's why we've got those extra rigs allocated in those 2 places right now."

Specifically, while it seems that well performance and efficiency gains are going to end up being structural benefits and also that highgrading and operational drilling and completion costs are going to be cyclical. And so first, would you agree with these basic cost categories? Or how do you guys think about them differently, leaving something out there? And then second, do you think that, that the cyclical structural cost decline ratio is kind of 60-40, which seems to be an emerging rule of thumb at the industry? And then finally, how do you think your cost profile is going to change during the next year or so?

And then there's the question about the timing of how those come back. Of course, the industry hasn't been through a cycle like this since the onslaught of the unconventional revolution. And so it really remains to be seen just how that ratio is going to turn out. We're all trying to model it and make some forward projections. But I'm sure we're all -- just as we all learned in our first down cycle in the unconventional, how the lag times are going to work and how the cyclical cost would work will be learning on the upside as well some new ground there. But I know everybody's talking their book about wanting to increase prices, and so we'll see what happens there. But I can tell you that we are going to be cost sensitive. It's part of our cost discipline that we are going to be selective in adding back rigs, pressure pumping crews, adding to that North American unconventional work. We don't have to do that. And if we get rapid reflation to where that starts driving up our cost supply then we're not going to add those rigs. We're going to stay disciplined in how we do that, maintain our returns focus."

I'll start by covering a few highlights from the third quarter, and Al will close with more on our operational results and what to watch for through the remainder of the year. 
I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of the third quarter.
We had a strong operational quarter and again exceeded the high end of our production guidance range, delivering 4% underlying growth -- production growth year-over-year. We safely completed an active turnaround season and achieved a major milestone with the startup of Train 2 at APLNG. 
Financially, we had an adjusted net loss of $826 million. We generated $1.23 billion of operating cash flow, excluding working capital. It's notable that during the third quarter, operating cash flows covered capital spending and dividends.
Cash flow in the quarter was also negatively impacted by about $230 million from special items related to rig termination costs and severance expenses. So if you take the clean number and adjust it to today's prices of about $50 a barrel, then on an annualized basis, that would be about $6.5 billion of operating cash flow, which is about what we would expect. Again, sufficient to cover sustaining capital and dividends.
Looking at operating cost, we continue to drive cost down and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the third quarter of 2015. Most of these reductions are structural and continue to lower the overall breakeven price of our business.
With respect to strategic objectives, in July, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our 3 exploration blocks offshore Senegal, which is part of our ongoing exit from deepwater exploration. We also reached agreement on the sale of our Block B assets in Indonesia. We expect both of these sales to close before the end of the year.
Earlier this month, we retired $1.25 billion of maturing debt and expect to end the year with debt a little over $27 billion. I'll go through our third quarter financial results on Slide 5.
While we operated well this quarter, low commodity prices continued to impact financial results. For the quarter, with an average realized price just under $30 per barrel, we reported an adjusted loss of $826 million or $0.66 per share. 
Year-over-year, adjusted earnings decreased as the result of a 9% drop in realized prices and lower equity affiliate earnings. Sequentially, adjusted earnings benefited from a 7% improvement in realized prices, mainly driven by improved North America natural gas prices as well as higher contract LNG prices.
Third quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide and are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
I'll cover production on Slide 6. Last year's third quarter volumes were 1,554 MBOE per day or 1,484 MBOE a day when adjusted for dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of less downtime, production increased by 56 MBOE a day, representing 4% year-over-year growth. That increase came primarily from higher volumes at APLNG and in the Canadian oil sands. Those increases were partially offset by a 28,000 BOE per day decrease in natural gas, primarily in North America, bringing us to the 1,557 for the third quarter. Al will provide more color on third quarter operating performance. 
If you turn to Slide 7, I'll cover year-to-date cash flow. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date, we generated $3.1 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital. Total working capital has been a use of cash of $600 million. Proceeds from asset sales have generated $400 million. Debt has increased by $3.8 billion but this number will decrease for the full year once we include the $1.25 billion repayment we made in October. Capital spending year-to-date has been $3.9 billion, and after dividend payments of around $900 million, we ended September with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.
So financially, we are very well-positioned. We've made good progress on driving the business to cash flow neutrality and on improving our balance sheet since the first quarter. I look forward to providing more detail on our financial plans next month in New York.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to take you through our operational performance."

I'll provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating highlights starting on Slide 9. Then I'll provide some additional thoughts for the rest of the year, including updated guidance for capital and adjusted operating cost.
Third quarter production averaged 1,557 MBOED, which exceeded the high end of guidance. The beat was driven by better-than-expected performance in Canada, Norway, Lower 48 unconventionals and Malaysia. We completed some significant turnaround activities in Alaska and Europe during the quarter, which brings an end to our major turnarounds for the year. 
We continue to see some production resiliency in the Lower 48 unconventionals despite the fact that we've been running only 3 rigs for the majority of the year, although we do expect more decline in the fourth quarter. 
Now that APLNG Train 2 has started up, the major project capital roll-off that we have been experiencing is essentially complete, so we've been working to shift more of our capital spending to the Lower 48 unconventionals. We've already been able to secure drilling rigs and pressure pumping crews at attractive rates to maintain our low cost of supply, so we expect this incremental drilling work to start ramping in November. This work will have no impact on 2016 volumes but will give us a head start on our 2017 production.
In Canada, Surmont fully recovered from the impact of the wildfires earlier this year and achieved a milestone of more than 100,000 barrels a day of gross production in mid-October. We're on track to exit this year at over 110,000 barrels a day gross as we continue to increase toward our 150,000 barrels a day gross capacity. 
In Australia, we achieved first production from Train 2 at APLNG in September and have again experienced a very smooth startup, which allowed us to begin delivering cargoes with Train 2 LNG in early October. 
We also have several conventional projects underway across the portfolio that are expected to come on production over the next couple of years: Alder and Clair Ridge in the U.K.; Aasta Hansteen in Norway; Malikai in Malaysia; and additional phases at Bohai in China; as well as GMT1 and 1H NEWS in Alaska.
So moving to Slide 10, I'll provide an update of our 2016 full year guidance. For the second quarter in a row, we've hit the trifecta. We increased production guidance based on robust production year-to-date while at the same time lowering both capital and adjusted operating cost guidance. We're driving strong execution and are focused on improving every aspect of our business, and we're not done with our improvements. There's more to come. 
We've revised full year production guidance to a range of 1,560 MBOED to 1,570 MBOED. That's up 10,000 barrels a day from prior guidance at the midpoint, reflecting our strong third quarter performance. 
Fourth quarter production guidance is 1,555 MBOED to 1,595 MBOED. We're lowering our capital guidance by $300 million from $5.5 billion to $5.2 billion, even though we're beginning to add rigs in Lower 48, as I just mentioned. 
Our efforts to reduce operating costs across the business are also succeeding. We're lowering our adjusted operating cost guidance by $200 million from $6.8 billion to $6.6 billion. 
As you can tell, we're continuing to improve the company's breakeven price and deliver strong momentum going into 2017. So that was a very quick recap of the third quarter. We look forward to giving you a deep dive of our portfolio and providing our 2017 operating plan at our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10.

And some of that, I've said in the past, will roll into some other mid-cycle type projects that are coming up, and the rest will tend to roll in the Lower 48 unconventionals. So I do expect that a fair chunk of that is going to go into Lower 48 unconventionals in the -- in 2017. And that's what you see as kind of starting now, as that work has rolled off, we've gotten ourselves ready. First, we went out and checked the market to see what kind of pricing we could get on rigs and frac crews. And provided that we still can get attractive rates similar to what we've been getting all year long, we're interested in getting started with that and that's what we found and so we've done that."

So that shows you how much progress we've made as we've gone through the year. And it's been a combination, as you know, of both the structural work that we've been doing. We've had a very rigorous program ongoing with a lot of concrete steps to drive down our cost, in addition to the more cyclical side of the deflation that we've been able to capture. And so it started strongest in the U.S. and the Lower 48 unconventionals, but as we progress through the year and as that has kind of asymptoted a bit, we're getting bigger savings in the later parts of the year in Alaska, Europe and the Far East, the rest of the world outside the U.S."

All right. Well, I'll let you take that one over for this quarter. Well, the first part of your question, the turnarounds where we had some pluses and minuses overall, quite successful operationally and came about right about on target, so less than 1,000 barrels a day delta from turnaround actuals versus what we had expected. The increase really has been driven by the Lower 48 unconventional by Canada, the oil sands side there, by stronger well performance in Norway and KBB in Malaysia, some better volumes there. Those have been the biggest pieces. A little bit in Alaska as well with the continuing outperformance from CD5. So it's been -- if I had to put a headline across all of that, I would say it's been really well performance and uptime beyond not so much that planned downtime, but our plan -- our unplanned downtime has been performing better than expected. So uptime has given us a little boost, but primarily, just well performance. In terms of the -- let me give you the actual numbers on the -- first, if you look at the total Lower 48 unconventional, last quarter, we were at 262,000 in the second quarter. Third quarter came in at 259,000, so down 3,000 barrels a day. The 3 big pieces of that, just because we got to get Paul Cheng's full question in here, Eagle Ford was 171,000 in the second quarter, it was down 8,000 to 163,000. The Bakken went from 64,000 in the second quarter to 61,000 in the third quarter, down 3,000. And then, the Permian was an offset. It was plus 8,000. The Permian shale went from 13,000 to 21,000 for a plus 8,000. So that -- and everything else was flat, our other unconventional Lower 48. So that's why the total added up to minus 3,000, minus 8,000 in Eagle Ford offset by a plus 8,000 in Permian and a minus 3,000 in Bakken."

So I think that the guidance we've given on trying to estimate cash flow is probably legitimate, still within that range, and that is to take the earnings sensitivities that we've given you and gross them up for the effective tax rate, put it on a pretax basis. It's going to be a while, as I mentioned before, I think, in North America and the U.S. and Canada before we move into a taxpaying position.

And so it really remains to be seen just how that ratio is going to turn out. We're all trying to model it and make some forward projections. But I'm sure we're all -- just as we all learned in our first down cycle in the unconventional, how the lag times are going to work and how the cyclical cost would work, we'll be learning on the upside as well with some new ground there. But I know everybody's talking their book about wanting to increase prices, and so we'll see what happens there. But I can tell you that we are going to be cost-sensitive. It's part of our cost discipline that we are going to be selective in adding back rigs, pressure pumping crews, adding to that North American unconventional work. We don't have to do that. And if we get rapid reflation to where that starts driving up our cost of supply, then we're not going to add those rigs.

But we're not in a hurry to go start drilling that up before we completely understand it. If you look at the very disciplined process that we've used in the Eagle Ford and in the Bakken where we make sure we understand it, everything from the spacing to the completion design to being able to drill with maximum efficiency, lining all that out before we go out there and just run a whole bunch of rigs drilling is our view of how to develop the asset the most efficiently and create -- and derive the most value from it. And so we're approaching the Permian in that same way. And in fact, this rush to the Permian by everybody else has really left us advantaged in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken because we don't have nearly as much competition for suppliers there for midstream. Everyone in the Permian is worrying now about all the pipes filling up and the plants filling up and not being able to get capacity, and just the way it used to be in the Eagle Ford.

But if we continue to produce at this 50,000 barrel a day gross from our facilities there, it should lead to a first lifting from Es Sider, from the port there sometime in November. But there's a tremendous amount of damage, significant challenges repairing infrastructure pipelines and out in the well field, also at the port and the tankage facilities there.

I'll start by covering a few highlights from the third quarter, and Al will close with more on our operational results and what to watch for through the remainder of the year. 
I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of the third quarter.
We had a strong operational quarter and again exceeded the high end of our production guidance range, delivering 4% underlying growth -- production growth year-over-year. We safely completed an active turnaround season and achieved a major milestone with the startup of Train 2 at APLNG. 
Financially, we had an adjusted net loss of $826 million. We generated $1.23 billion of operating cash flow, excluding working capital. It's notable that during the third quarter, operating cash flows covered capital spending and dividends.
Cash flow in the quarter was also negatively impacted by about $230 million from special items related to rig termination costs and severance expenses. So if you take the clean number and adjust it to today's prices of about $50 a barrel, then on an annualized basis, that would be about $6.5 billion of operating cash flow, which is about what we would expect. Again, sufficient to cover sustaining capital and dividends.
Looking at operating cost, we continue to drive cost down and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the third quarter of 2015. Most of these reductions are structural and continue to lower the overall breakeven price of our business.
With respect to strategic objectives, in July, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our 3 exploration blocks offshore Senegal, which is part of our ongoing exit from deepwater exploration. We also reached agreement on the sale of our Block B assets in Indonesia. We expect both of these sales to close before the end of the year.
Earlier this month, we retired $1.25 billion of maturing debt and expect to end the year with debt a little over $27 billion. I'll go through our third quarter financial results on Slide 5.
While we operated well this quarter, low commodity prices continued to impact financial results. For the quarter, with an average realized price just under $30 per barrel, we reported an adjusted loss of $826 million or $0.66 per share. 
Year-over-year, adjusted earnings decreased as the result of a 9% drop in realized prices and lower equity affiliate earnings. Sequentially, adjusted earnings benefited from a 7% improvement in realized prices, mainly driven by improved North America natural gas prices as well as higher contract LNG prices.
Third quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide and are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
I'll cover production on Slide 6. Last year's third quarter volumes were 1,554 MBOE per day or 1,484 MBOE a day when adjusted for dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of less downtime, production increased by 56 MBOE a day, representing 4% year-over-year growth. That increase came primarily from higher volumes at APLNG and in the Canadian oil sands. Those increases were partially offset by a 28,000 BOE per day decrease in natural gas, primarily in North America, bringing us to the 1,557 for the third quarter. Al will provide more color on third quarter operating performance. 
If you turn to Slide 7, I'll cover year-to-date cash flow. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date, we generated $3.1 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital. Total working capital has been a use of cash of $600 million. Proceeds from asset sales have generated $400 million. Debt has increased by $3.8 billion but this number will decrease for the full year once we include the $1.25 billion repayment we made in October. Capital spending year-to-date has been $3.9 billion, and after dividend payments of around $900 million, we ended September with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.
So financially, we are very well-positioned. We've made good progress on driving the business to cash flow neutrality and on improving our balance sheet since the first quarter. I look forward to providing more detail on our financial plans next month in New York.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to take you through our operational performance."

I'll provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating highlights starting on Slide 9. Then I'll provide some additional thoughts for the rest of the year, including updated guidance for capital and adjusted operating cost.
Third quarter production averaged 1,557 MBOED, which exceeded the high end of guidance. The beat was driven by better-than-expected performance in Canada, Norway, Lower 48 unconventionals and Malaysia. We completed some significant turnaround activities in Alaska and Europe during the quarter, which brings an end to our major turnarounds for the year. 
We continue to see some production resiliency in the Lower 48 unconventionals despite the fact that we've been running only 3 rigs for the majority of the year, although we do expect more decline in the fourth quarter. 
Now that APLNG Train 2 has started up, the major project capital roll-off that we have been experiencing is essentially complete, so we've been working to shift more of our capital spending to the Lower 48 unconventionals. We've already been able to secure drilling rigs and pressure pumping crews at attractive rates to maintain our low cost of supply, so we expect this incremental drilling work to start ramping in November. This work will have no impact on 2016 volumes but will give us a head start on our 2017 production.
In Canada, Surmont fully recovered from the impact of the wildfires earlier this year and achieved a milestone of more than 100,000 barrels a day of gross production in mid-October. We're on track to exit this year at over 110,000 barrels a day gross as we continue to increase toward our 150,000 barrels a day gross capacity. 
In Australia, we achieved first production from Train 2 at APLNG in September and have again experienced a very smooth startup, which allowed us to begin delivering cargoes with Train 2 LNG in early October. 
We also have several conventional projects underway across the portfolio that are expected to come on production over the next couple of years: Alder and Clair Ridge in the U.K.; Aasta Hansteen in Norway; Malikai in Malaysia; and additional phases at Bohai in China; as well as GMT1 and 1H NEWS in Alaska.
So moving to Slide 10, I'll provide an update of our 2016 full year guidance. For the second quarter in a row, we've hit the trifecta. We increased production guidance based on robust production year-to-date while at the same time lowering both capital and adjusted operating cost guidance. We're driving strong execution and are focused on improving every aspect of our business, and we're not done with our improvements. There's more to come. 
We've revised full year production guidance to a range of 1,560 MBOED to 1,570 MBOED. That's up 10,000 barrels a day from prior guidance at the midpoint, reflecting our strong third quarter performance. 
Fourth quarter production guidance is 1,555 MBOED to 1,595 MBOED. We're lowering our capital guidance by $300 million from $5.5 billion to $5.2 billion, even though we're beginning to add rigs in the Lower 48, as I just mentioned. 
Our efforts to reduce operating costs across the business are also succeeding. We're lowering our adjusted operating cost guidance by $200 million from $6.8 billion to $6.6 billion. 
As you can tell, we're continuing to improve the company's breakeven price and deliver strong momentum going into 2017. So that was a very quick recap of the third quarter. We look forward to giving you a deep dive of our portfolio and providing our 2017 operating plan at our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10. 
So now, I'll turn the call over for Q&A related to the quarter."

And some of that, I've said in the past, will roll into some other mid-cycle type projects that are coming up, and the rest will tend to roll in the Lower 48 unconventionals.

And then, with the falling prices and the soft market, we backed off and said we've done most of the strategic things we want to do. And we kind of set a sort of a status quo business as usual goal of maybe $1 billion to $2 billion in a really weak market, maybe more toward the $1 billion, which is sort of what we've guided toward this year. In a better market, maybe $2 billion. I think, as prices recover, then we continue to look at the portfolio for opportunities. And so we get a little more interested in asset sales in a recovering market than the one that we've been in, in the last couple of years."

So that shows you how much progress we've made as we've gone through the year. And it's been a combination, as you know, of both the structural work that we've been doing. We've had a very rigorous program ongoing with a lot of concrete steps to drive down our cost, in addition to the more cyclical side of the deflation that we've been able to capture. And so it started strongest in the U.S. and the Lower 48 unconventionals, but as we progress through the year and as that has kind of asymptoted a bit, we're getting bigger savings in the later parts of the year in Alaska, Europe and the Far East, the rest of the world outside the U.S."

All right. Well will let you take that one over for this quarter. Well, the first part of your question, the turnarounds where we had some pluses and minuses overall, quite successful operationally and came about right about on target, so less than 1,000 barrels a day delta from turnaround actuals versus what we had expected. The increase really has been driven by the Lower 48 unconventional by Canada, the oil sands side there, by stronger well performance in Norway and KBB in Malaysia, some better volumes there. Those have been the biggest pieces. A little bit in Alaska as well with the continuing outperformance from CD5. So it's been -- if I had to put a headline across all of that, I would say it's been really well performance and uptime beyond not so much that planned downtime, but our plan -- our unplanned downtime has been performing better than expected. So uptime has given us a little boost, but primarily, just well performance. In terms of the -- let me give you the actual numbers on the -- first, if you look at the total Lower 48 unconventional, last quarter, we were at 262,000 in the second quarter. Third quarter came in at 259,000, so down 3,000 barrels a day. The 3 big pieces of that, just because we got to get Paul Cheng's full question in here, Eagle Ford was 171,000 in the second quarter, it was down 8,000 to 163,000. The Bakken went from 64,000 in the second quarter to 61,000 in the third quarter, down 3,000. And then, the Permian was an offset. It was plus 8,000. The Permian shale went from 13,000 to 21,000 for a plus 8,000. So that -- and everything else was flat, our other unconventional Lower 48. So that's why the total added up to minus 3,000, minus 8,000 in Eagle Ford offset by a plus 8,000 in Permian and a minus 3,000 in Bakken."

Specifically, while it seems that well performance and efficiency gains are going to end up being structural benefits and also seems that high-grading and operational drilling and completion costs are going to be cyclical. And so first, would you agree with these basic cost categories? Or Al, do you guys think about them differently? Meaning, am I leaving something out there? And then, second, do you think that the cyclical/structural cost decline ratio is kind of 60-40, which seems to be an emerging rule of thumb for the industry?

And when we turn the crank on that system, it says about 2/3 of the savings we've achieved over the last couple of years are structural and about 1/3 cyclical. And then, there's the question about the timing of how those come back. Of course, the industry hasn't been through a cycle like this since the onslaught of the unconventional revolution. And so it really remains to be seen just how that ratio is going to turn out. We're all trying to model it and make some forward projections. But I'm sure we're all -- just as we all learned in our first down cycle in the unconventional, how the lag times are going to work and how the cyclical cost would work, we'll be learning on the upside as well with some new ground there. But I know everybody's talking their book about wanting to increase prices, and so we'll see what happens there. But I can tell you that we are going to be cost-sensitive. It's part of our cost discipline that we are going to be selective in adding back rigs, pressure pumping crews, adding to that North American unconventional work. We don't have to do that. And if we get rapid reflation to where that starts driving up our cost of supply, then we're not going to add those rigs.

And so we're approaching the Permian in that same way. And in fact, this rush to the Permian by everybody else has really left us advantaged in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken because we don't have nearly as much competition for suppliers there for midstream.

Our cautionary statement is shown on Page 2 of today's presentation. We will make some forward-looking statements during today's call that refers to estimates and plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors noted on this slide and in our periodic SEC filings. 
We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today. These help facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. For any non-GAAP measures that we use, we'll provide a reconciliation -- we provided a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure that can also be found on our website. 
One final note before we jump in, as most of you know, ConocoPhillips will hold our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10. That's just around the corner. At that time, we'll provide an update on our strategy and our 2017 operating plan, so we will not be addressing those topics on today's call.

I'll start by covering a few highlights from the third quarter, and Al will close with more on our operational results and what to watch for through the remainder of the year. 
I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of the third quarter.
We had a strong operational quarter and again exceeded the high end of our production guidance range, delivering 4% underlying growth -- production growth year-over-year. We safely completed an active turnaround season and achieved a major milestone with the startup of Train 2 at APLNG. 
Financially, we had an adjusted net loss of $826 million. We generated $1.23 billion of operating cash flow, excluding working capital. It's notable that during the third quarter, operating cash flows covered capital spending and dividends.
Cash flow in the quarter was also negatively impacted by about $230 million from special items related to rig termination costs and severance expenses. So if you take the clean number and adjust it to today's prices of about $50 a barrel, then on an annualized basis, that would be about $6.5 billion of operating cash flow, which is about what we would expect. Again, sufficient to cover sustaining capital and dividends.
Looking at operating cost, we continue to drive cost down and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared to the third quarter of 2015. Most of these reductions are structural and continue to lower the overall breakeven price of our business.
With respect to strategic objectives, in July, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our 3 exploration blocks offshore Senegal, which is part of our ongoing exit from deepwater exploration. We also reached agreement on the sale of our Block B assets in Indonesia. We expect both of these sales to close before the end of the year.
Earlier this month, we retired $1.25 billion of maturing debt and expect to end the year with debt a little over $27 billion. I'll go through our third quarter financial results on Slide 5.
While we operated well this quarter, low commodity prices continued to impact financial results. For the quarter, with an average realized price just under $30 per barrel, we reported an adjusted loss of $826 million or $0.66 per share. 
Year-over-year, adjusted earnings decreased as the result of a 9% drop in realized prices and lower equity affiliate earnings. Sequentially, adjusted earnings benefited from a 7% improvement in realized prices, mainly driven by improved North America natural gas prices as well as higher contract LNG prices.
Third quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower right side of the slide and are roughly in line with expectations. The supplemental data on our website provides additional financial detail.
I'll cover production on Slide 6. Last year's third quarter volumes were 1,554 MBOE per day or 1,484 MBOE a day when adjusted for dispositions. Adjusting for the impact of less downtime, production increased by 56 MBOE a day, representing 4% year-over-year growth. That increase came primarily from higher volumes at APLNG and in the Canadian oil sands. Those increases were partially offset by a 28,000 BOE per day decrease in natural gas, primarily in North America, bringing us to the 1,557 for the third quarter. Al will provide more color on third quarter operating performance. 
If you turn to Slide 7, I'll cover year-to-date cash flow. We started the year with $2.4 billion in cash. Year-to-date, we generated $3.1 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital. Total working capital has been a use of cash of $600 million. Proceeds from asset sales have generated $400 million. Debt has increased by $3.8 billion but this number will decrease for the full year once we include the $1.25 billion repayment we made in October. Capital spending year-to-date has been $3.9 billion, and after dividend payments of around $900 million, we ended September with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.
So financially, we are very well-positioned. We've made good progress on driving the business to cash flow neutrality and on improving our balance sheet since the first quarter. I look forward to providing more detail on our financial plans next month in New York.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to take you through our operational performance."

I'll provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating highlights starting on Slide 9. Then I'll provide some additional thoughts for the rest of the year, including updated guidance for capital and adjusted operating cost.
Third quarter production averaged 1,557 MBOED, which exceeded the high end of guidance. The beat was driven by better-than-expected performance in Canada, Norway, Lower 48 unconventionals and Malaysia. We completed some significant turnaround activities in Alaska and Europe during the quarter, which brings an end to our major turnarounds for the year. 
We continue to see some production resiliency in the Lower 48 unconventionals despite the fact that we've been running only 3 rigs for the majority of the year, although we do expect more decline in the fourth quarter. 
Now that APLNG Train 2 has started up, the major project capital roll-off that we have been experiencing is essentially complete, so we've been working to shift more of our capital spending to the Lower 48 unconventionals. We've already been able to secure drilling rigs and pressure pumping crews at attractive rates to maintain our low cost of supply, so we expect this incremental drilling work to start ramping in November. This work will have no impact on 2016 volumes but will give us a head start on our 2017 production.
In Canada, Surmont fully recovered from the impact of the wildfires earlier this year and achieved a milestone of more than 100,000 barrels a day of gross production in mid-October. We're on track to exit this year at over 110,000 barrels a day gross as we continue to increase toward our 150,000 barrels a day gross capacity. 
In Australia, we achieved first production from Train 2 at APLNG in September and have again experienced a very smooth startup, which allowed us to begin delivering cargoes with Train 2 LNG in early October. 
We also have several conventional projects underway across the portfolio that are expected to come on production over the next couple of years: Alder and Clair Ridge in the U.K.; Aasta Hansteen in Norway; Malikai in Malaysia; and additional phases at Bohai in China; as well as GMT1 and 1H NEWS in Alaska.
So moving to Slide 10, I'll provide an update of our 2016 full year guidance. For the second quarter in a row, we've hit the trifecta. We increased production guidance based on robust production year-to-date while at the same time lowering both capital and adjusted operating cost guidance. We're driving strong execution and are focused on improving every aspect of our business, and we're not done with our improvements. There's more to come. 
We've revised full year production guidance to a range of 1,560 MBOED to 1,570 MBOED. That's up 10,000 barrels a day from prior guidance at the midpoint, reflecting our strong third quarter performance. 
Fourth quarter production guidance is 1,555 MBOED to 1,595 MBOED. We're lowering our capital guidance by $300 million from $5.5 billion to $5.2 billion, even though we're beginning to add rigs in the Lower 48, as I just mentioned. 
Our efforts to reduce operating costs across the business are also succeeding. We're lowering our adjusted operating cost guidance by $200 million from $6.8 billion to $6.6 billion. 
As you can tell, we're continuing to improve the company's breakeven price and deliver strong momentum going into 2017. So that was a very quick recap of the third quarter. We look forward to giving you a deep dive of our portfolio and providing our 2017 operating plan at our Analyst and Investor Meeting on November 10. 
So now, I'll turn the call over for Q&A related to the quarter."

And some of that, I've said in the past, will roll into some other mid-cycle type projects that are coming up, and the rest will tend to roll in the Lower 48 unconventionals. So I do expect that a fair chunk of that is going to go into Lower 48 unconventionals in the -- in 2017. And that's what you see as kind of starting now, as that work has rolled off, we've gotten ourselves ready. First, we went out and checked the market to see what kind of pricing we could get on rigs and frac crews.

All right. Well will let you take that one over for this quarter. Well, the first part of your question, the turnarounds where we had some pluses and minuses overall, quite successful operationally and came about right about on target, so less than 1,000 barrels a day delta from turnaround actuals versus what we had expected. The increase really has been driven by the Lower 48 unconventional by Canada, the oil sands side there, by stronger well performance in Norway and KBB in Malaysia, some better volumes there. Those have been the biggest pieces. A little bit in Alaska as well with the continuing outperformance from CD5. So it's been -- if I had to put a headline across all of that, I would say it's been really well performance and uptime beyond not so much that planned downtime, but our plan -- our unplanned downtime has been performing better than expected. So uptime has given us a little boost, but primarily, just well performance. In terms of the -- let me give you the actual numbers on the -- first, if you look at the total Lower 48 unconventional, last quarter, we were at 262,000 in the second quarter. Third quarter came in at 259,000, so down 3,000 barrels a day. The 3 big pieces of that, just because we got to get Paul Cheng's full question in here, Eagle Ford was 171,000 in the second quarter, it was down 8,000 to 163,000. The Bakken went from 64,000 in the second quarter to 61,000 in the third quarter, down 3,000. And then, the Permian was an offset. It was plus 8,000. The Permian shale went from 13,000 to 21,000 for a plus 8,000. So that -- and everything else was flat, our other unconventional Lower 48. So that's why the total added up to minus 3,000, minus 8,000 in Eagle Ford offset by a plus 8,000 in Permian and a minus 3,000 in Bakken."

We will be looking to add rigs in our Permian acreage in 2017 but that's not part of this late '16 effort. On the Bakken, we've been fairly steady there on our progress in terms of recoveries and costs. But recently, we've put a new completion design into place, and we're going to talk more about it our Investor Day, and so we're really pretty excited. That's part of why we're eager to get some rigs back to work in the Bakken. In the Eagle Ford, if you look at our cost of supply there, we've got such a huge segment that's got down and below $25 fully burdened cost supply, single well cost supply in the mid-teens. And so who wouldn't want to go run more rigs there in the Eagle Ford? And so that's why we've got those extra rigs allocated in those 2 places right now."

And then, second, I wanted to ask another cost question but from somewhat of a different perspective than we talked about so far. Specifically, while it seems that well performance and efficiency gains are going to end up being structural benefits and also seems that high-grading and operational drilling and completion costs are going to be cyclical. And so first, would you agree with these basic cost categories? Or Al, do you guys think about them differently? Meaning, am I leaving something out there? And then, second, do you think that the cyclical/structural cost decline ratio is kind of 60-40, which seems to be an emerging rule of thumb for the industry? And then, finally, how do you think your cost profile is going to change during the next year or so? And the reason I asked is because there's some rumblings out there that service companies are obviously operating at unsustainable margins and something has to give. So 3 questions on cost, framework and your expectations."

We have, as I mentioned earlier, a rigorous tracking system to track all these reductions. And when we turn the crank on that system, it says about 2/3 of the savings we've achieved over the last couple of years are structural and about 1/3 cyclical. And then, there's the question about the timing of how those come back. Of course, the industry hasn't been through a cycle like this since the onslaught of the unconventional revolution. And so it really remains to be seen just how that ratio is going to turn out. We're all trying to model it and make some forward projections. But I'm sure we're all -- just as we all learned in our first down cycle in the unconventional, how the lag times are going to work and how the cyclical cost would work, we'll be learning on the upside as well with some new ground there. But I know everybody's talking their book about wanting to increase prices, and so we'll see what happens there. But I can tell you that we are going to be cost-sensitive. It's part of our cost discipline that we are going to be selective in adding back rigs, pressure pumping crews, adding to that North American unconventional work. We don't have to do that. And if we get rapid reflation to where that starts driving up our cost of supply, then we're not going to add those rigs. We're going to stay disciplined in how we do that, maintain our returns focus."

But we have on the order of 100,000, 110,000 acres in the core part of the Permian. That's both in the Delaware and the Midland basins. And we've done enough appraisal work there to see that we've obviously got very attractive acreage in the heart of those plays that is going to give us excellent economics, just as you hear from everybody else. But we're not in a hurry to go start drilling that up before we completely understand it. If you look at the very disciplined process that we've used in the Eagle Ford and in the Bakken where we make sure we understand it, everything from the spacing to the completion design to being able to drill with maximum efficiency, lining all that out before we go out there and just run a whole bunch of rigs drilling is our view of how to develop the asset the most efficiently and create -- and derive the most value from it. And so we're approaching the Permian in that same way. And in fact, this rush to the Permian by everybody else has really left us advantaged in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken because we don't have nearly as much competition for suppliers there for midstream. Everyone in the Permian is worrying now about all the pipes filling up and the plants filling up and not being able to get capacity, and just the way it used to be in the Eagle Ford. These days, in the Eagle Ford, there's [indiscernible] of all kinds and people offering us good deals.

But if we continue to produce at this 50,000 barrel a day gross from our facilities there, it should lead to a first lifting from Es Sider, from the port there sometime in November.
