And if I sound funny this morning, it's because I'm nursing a very bad cold. 
I'm pleased to announce that PepsiCo delivered to shareholders a terrific year in 2015 with strong organic revenue growth and 10% core constant currency EPS growth. We simultaneously enhanced our competitiveness and prospects for future growth while meeting or exceeding each of the 2015 financial goals that we shared with you this time last year. From a strategic perspective, we held or gained market share across most of our key markets. We built the strength of our brands, evidenced by both our strong organic top line growth and 40 basis point increase in A&M as a percentage of sales. We continue to extend our innovation advantage, growing new platforms, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Stacy's Pita snacks and drinks in China and simultaneously invested for the future by increasing our R&D spending. We continued to win in foodservice by adding Disney in China, Subway across several countries and renewing China due primarily to our broad product portfolio and superior customer service. And we enhanced our offerings to our foodservice partners in 2015 through the establishment of exciting new platforms like Stubborn Soda, Mountain Dew Black Label and Hello Goodness vending. We added major new marketing properties with the NBA and UEAFA Champions League. And we expect to derive value from them through our rapidly global marketing and design capabilities. And we delivered a record-setting year for productivity as our outstanding operating teams leveraged our global supply chain center of excellence to execute best practices and new ideas with great position across all of our businesses. 
While delivering strong strategic results, we delivered financially. We targeted mid single-digit organic revenue growth and delivered 5% growth. We targeted core operating margin expansion and delivered a 30-basis point improvement. We delivered 10% core constant currency EPS growth against our initial target of 7% and converted 120% of core net income to free cash flow, excluding certain items, through strong capital management. This strong cash generation enabled us to provide attractive cash return to our shareholders, a total of $9 billion in 2015. And our core net return on invested capital stands at 19.6% at the end of 2015, up 430 basis points over the past 3 years.
I'm particularly pleased to note that we achieved these results in the face of a challenging macro and environment. Over my several decades in business, I have never seen this combination of sustained headwinds across most economies combined with high volatility across global financial market. From my meetings and observations traveling around the world, I have noted slowing economic growth and recession across all but the U.S. and a few other -- across the U.S. and a few other countries as a combination of geopolitics and oil have created many challenging economic outcomes. The slower economic growth has resulted in lower demand for commodities, which has put extreme pressure on previously booming economies like Russia, Canada and Brazil, just to name a few. In order to address slowing demand, central banks have to kickstarted economies as these tools have largely been fully exploited over the past several years. In addition, increased government regulation, including increased taxation, labeling requirements and limitations on social programs are placing further pressure on consumer demand. 
These macro issues have created 3 broad risks for the consumer and for CPG companies. First, the widespread economic malaise has created a strong U.S. dollar, which has the effect of creating local inflation in international markets and threaten to derail the U.S. economic recovery. Second, volatile financial markets may cause a pullback in corporate investment and consumer spending. And finally, the continued weak economic performance is causing widespread political and social turmoil across the globe, which may create even greater economic harm. 
In the face of these challenges, our geographic sectors managed very well during 2015, exploring the more positive environments for superior results while carefully navigating weak environments to balance tight cost management with judicious investment to surgically capture growth. 
In a relatively positive macroenvironment, our performance in North America was particularly strong with both Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages turning in very good operating and financial performances. Each posted 3% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency operating profit growth for the year. Frito-Lay North America once again delivered consistent results while continuing to transform its package architecture in potato chips and its go-to-market system through further expansion of the GES program. North American Beverages had its best financial performance in recent memory, benefiting from the continuation of improved industry pricing dynamics, a broad product portfolio and continued positive innovation performance. And Quaker Foods North America began a turnaround in 2015, delivering positive organic revenue results for the first time in several years and gaining value share across breakfast categories of hot and ready-to-eat cereal and syrup and mix. 
And I'm pleased to report that PepsiCo once again was the single largest contributor to U.S. retail food and beverage growth for our customers. For the full year, we provided more growth in U.S. retail sales than the next 15 largest food and beverage manufacturers combined. And it's this success that uniquely positions us as our customers' go-to partner to drive growth.
When we look beyond North America, our international divisions clearly dealt with the lion's share of the macro challenges that I mentioned earlier. And yet despite these challenges, we were able to grow organic revenue 8% and core constant currency operating profit 6% for the year by executing effective pricing strategies, launching exciting innovative products, localizing sourcing to address FX transaction headwinds and driving productivity that provided investment funding that will propel future growth. So overall, a very good performance for the year and we believe we are well-positioned as we enter 2016.
Now you may recall that we focused on one of our big performance-driving initiatives on each of the last 3 earnings calls. On our prior calls, we covered innovation supported by sensible brand management. Then we talked about flawless execution. And last time we talked about self-sustaining productivity. Today, I want to focus on the fourth of these initiatives, cash generation and prudent capital allocation. 
Now a substantial portion of our earnings converts to free cash flow, and we generate a lot of cash. In fact, over the past 3 years, we converted more than 100% of our core earnings to free cash flow and we generated more than $24 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items, including $8 billion generated in 2015 alone. More broadly, we are highly disciplined in how we allocate this cash with a particular focus on returning cash to shareholders. 
Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business, normally in the form of CapEx and working capital but also within the P&L, in A&M, R&D and market investment and routes and racks. In fact, since 2011, we've increased A&M as a percentage of sales by 110 basis points and R&D spending is up 40%. We have rigorous capital planning and review processes. Our CapEx investments have very attractive returns on investment, and we continually find ways to drive returns even higher by driving greater success of utilization and by reducing the cost of adding capacity. Over the past 4 years, we have reduced CapEx as a percentage of sales to 4.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, which is an improvement of 60 basis points. On a revenue base of $63 billion this equates to an annual cash savings of approximately $380 million. 
Similarly, our efforts to improve our working capital have yielded positive results. Over the past 3 years, we've improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 30 days, which contributed $2.5 billion to cash flow improvement. So both our CapEx and working capital productivity have been significant contributors to our very favorable free cash flow performance.
Our second priority is to pay dividends to our shareholders. We raised our dividend for 44 consecutive years effective with the June 2016 payment. And this is through both consistent earnings growth and by raising our payout ratio over time. With this morning's announced dividend increase, we expect to pay out approximately 60% of our core 2015 earnings. And our dividend yield at yesterday's closing stock price is an attractive 3%. And our 10-year compound annual growth in dividend per share is 10%. Continuity of dividends and growth in annual dividend per share are a point of great pride for PepsiCo, and we view them as a vitally important element to the total shareholder return equation.
Our third priority is to strengthen our market positions and create value through responsible tuck-in acquisitions, generally less than $500 million a year in total, which equates to a relatively small percentage of annual free cash flow. We built a lot of capability in evaluating and integrating tuck-in acquisitions, and we have very disciplined strategic and financial guidelines to ensure that they are value-creating. Our acquisition evaluation is comprehensive and includes assessment of geographic considerations, category growth and attractiveness, scalability, competitive dynamics, people and business systems, integration, cultural fit and transaction complexity. 
And our fourth capital allocation priority is to return residual cash to our shareholders through share repurchases, and we plan to do so within the confines of maintaining our capital structure that provides us ready access to the debt capital markets at attractive rates. Over the past 3 and 10 years, we've returned more than $13 billion and $35 billion, respectively, to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Next, our focus on capital allocation discipline has yielded impressive results. We returned more than $65 billion to shareholders over the past 10 years in combined dividends and share repurchases. 
Before Hugh covers guidance in details, I'll just make a few broader points about the landscape going forward. We expect a continuation of the many macro challenges we faced this year, strong U.S. dollar, sluggish growth and recession in most developing and emerging markets, political and social unrest in a number of regions and increased government regulation. And as I mentioned, while the U.S. economy is experiencing a recovery, it's delicate, and there is a risk that it will not sustain itself if the rest of the globe continues to experience such maximum pressures. But even in the face of this rather challenging global landscape, I'm optimistic about PepsiCo's future. We have made a prudent appraisal of those factors outside of our control, and we are controlling those factors we can control. Our teams around the globe are executing well. Our innovation pipeline is full and promising. And the sustained investments we've made in strengthening marketing and developing cutting-edge capabilities will serve us well as we move through the year. We believe we have the plans in place for 2016 to continue to deliver strong financial results.
And we have something that's equally important, the right plans, we have the right people. The fact that we've achieved so much in what has been a protracted and extremely challenging and volatile environment is a testament to the strength and experience of our management team. We benefit greatly from a senior management team distinguished by continuity, experience and skill. Our sector heads and CFO, Al, Tom, Ramon, Sanjiv and Hugh have 140 years of combined PepsiCo experience across multiple categories, markets and functions. And at the same time, we are developing and advancing PepsiCo's next generation of leadership. The appointments over just the past 24 months of and Ramon to their respective sector leadership roles and the appointments of Brian Newman to run global operations and to run our global category groups are a few key examples of such next-generation leaders who'd gained tremendous experience already and have much runway ahead of them at PepsiCo. 
So with these comments, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,322158045,931216,"Pepsico, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as was said in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation a",615,"Great, and good morning, everyone. 
Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as was said in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation as well as our revenue management capabilities, driving organic revenue growth and positive net price realization. And taking our core 2015 EPS of $4.57 and applying our guidance and current foreign exchange market consensus rates implies a 2016 core EPS of approximately $4.66. 
Let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. First, we will have a 53rd week in 2016 as we do every 5 or 6 years, which principally impacts our North American businesses given that our international businesses report on a monthly calendar. Our organic revenue growth outlook excludes the impact of this extra week, and our intention is to reinvest the benefit from the extra week in growth and productivity initiatives. 
Second, we will be lapping the deconsolidation of our Venezuela business which occurred at the end of Q3 in 2015. Venezuela contributed approximately $0.10 per share to core earnings in the first 3 quarters of 2015. 
And third, foreign exchange translation will continue to be a headwind, with most of our key international markets' currencies expected to decline versus the U.S. dollar in 2016. Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates, this is expected to be a 4 point drag on both net revenue and core EPS. 
Additionally, to the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2016, which is in line with our overall objective of achieving $5 billion of productivity over the 5 years through 2019. We anticipate continued reduction in corporate expenses, and we expect our share count to benefit from a targeted $3 billion in share repurchases. 
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate continued volatile macros, especially in the developing and emerging markets. And commodity inflation is deflationary in the low-single digits excluding foreign exchange and low-single digit inflationary including the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange in many of the markets whose currencies have and are expected to continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar. 
Also keep in mind that because of our forward-buying approach, our commodity costs tend to lag what you see in the spot markets. 
As you model out the quarters, we ask you to consider the following: We deconsolidated our Venezuela operations at the end of Q3 in 2015, so our EPS comparisons will be impacted by lapping the elimination of earnings from Venezuela during the first 3 quarters of 2016. The AMENA division will face a difficult operating profit comparison during Q1 2016 as the business laps a gain related to refranchising a portion of India bottling operations. And the benefit of the 53rd week will fall on the fourth quarter of the year, while our reinvestment of the benefit of the 53rd week will be made throughout the year. We will maintain a high level of discipline toward capital application with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We expect to return $4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends, and we expect to return an additional $3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases. 
So combined, we expect these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $7 billion in 2016. Capital allocation is a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment. 
With that, we are ready to take the first question."

And it's not just emerging markets, as we travel around the world. Let me just take a quick walk around the world. As we look at Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, if you look at Colombia, between a combination of the economic issues in the country and the currency devaluation, it's causing tremendous strain on anybody who is operating in that country, leave alone American companies have to report in U.S. dollars because you have both a transaction and a translation problem to deal with. Transaction because a lot of the commodities we buy are denominated in dollars. So we have to figure out how to price that through. If you go over to Europe, the Western European market, I would say, did show some signs of recovery but not to the level that we would like to see it. Interestingly, our businesses in East Europe are doing well with respect to the local market but, again, the currency is really taking a bite out of the profit streams that come out of that market. I was in the Middle East about 3 week ago. The teams there are very resilient, but they have to cope every day with the issues in the Middle East, whether it's country is going through a tax or the refugee crisis, I mean it is pretty severe, what's going on there, and many routes have to get off the market at times. And our teams are all local, so they figure out a way to operate, but it is tough. And I think we're one of the few companies that keeps an operation going because our routes can come on quickly when there is a lull in the activity there. So I would say it's difficult to watch that region going through the problems it's going through. And as you move further east, India is holding up. The Pacific Rim is holding up nicely. Don't see too many issues. And China, going into the Chinese New Year, last year I think the market was very sluggish. But this year, it started off moderately okay. And if you ask me about how the year has started off, look, one period or one month a year does not make. But the year has started off okay. And again, I want to be very clear, what we can control, we are doing very well, execution, productivity, innovation and on the shelf, we are doing a very good job. And that's giving us some tailwinds. What we cannot control, which is the geopolitical issues, the incredible currency turmoil, we just have to accept it for the moment. And so I'd say the teams are executing very well in the marketplace, and that's why we feel cautiously optimistic on the one hand while feeling despondent about the macros on the other hand.

Recall, our bucket of OpEx is about $28 billion, a little over half of that is labor and labor will inflate somewhere around 4% for the year. In addition to that, you'll see continued investments in advertising and marketing as you have over the last couple of years, and the reason we continue to invest in that is we continue to get good returns on it, hence the 4% to 5% revenue growth you've seen over the last couple of years. You will see higher investment in research and development as well, same answer on that, we are continuing to see good returns on that. And then, of course, with the revenue growth that we've seen over the last couple of years, we do need to invest in manufacturing lines. We need to invest in routes. We need to invest in racks to place the products on.

I think there are 2 or 3 things to think about. One is in categories which are not growing robustly, like carbonated soft drinks, you should manage pricing very carefully because there's no point trying to drop the pricing because it's not going to drive additional demand. So in that particular category, through a combination of revenue management, through a combination of intelligent price pack architecture, you just figure out how to get some pricing from the marketplace. So that's hold on the side. Second, an area where we really look for pricing is innovation. Because if there's one place where the consumer likes the news and is willing to pay up for, it's for innovation. And we've been really ramping up our innovation machine to be able to get price realization through innovation. The third is through a channel mix. And if you sell most single serve, if you sell through channels there, the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more, that clearly is a help. And lastly, even if you don't get the pricing in some places, we're going to take our costs down. So we were looking at how to reengineer our supply chain end to end, how to work with customers to rethink our supply chain. So there's a lot of work going on in our company in terms of rethinking our end-to-end costs to align our supply chain with customers so we can mutually take out costs and then figure out a way to pass some of it to the consumer. So that's really our strategy on pricing."

Is it broad-based? Is it more food versus beverage? Domestic versus international? would be helpful. And then more broadly, I'm just wondering if anything you're seeing out there that gives you more confidence on the margin in that spending because I'm struck now by how many CPG companies emphasized the return to AMP investment in the last few weeks. Interesting against the backdrop, the macro backdrop as you pointed out is not getting easier. So is the increased that you're making, is it PepsiCo specific against proactive opportunities? Is it against things that may be sort of deceptively encouraging for the broader industry? Or does any of your increase simply driven by need to keep pace and maintain share of voice versus peers that are also stepping up their investments? Any clarity there would be helpful."

As we cut across snacks and beverages, numbers went up in both categories. As we cut across the geographies, all of our geographies saw an increase in advertising and marketing spend. Number two, in terms of where is the money going, I would say that more of it is going to digital over time. The big constraint on moving more to digital is identifying high quality properties to advertise on. So it's not just a matter of going for pop-up ads any more. It's really more sophisticated digital advertising, and that is probably more than anything the rate limiting factor is finding high quality assets to invest in. Third, as you've seen as recently as the Super Bowl this past weekend, we are investing in big properties because these big properties do enable breakthrough types of messaging. And I think we, over the last several years as well as for a longer period of time, have been quite successful in investing in those big properties. And then fourth, from a returns perspective, obviously, measuring advertising in marketing return is a little bit trickier than measuring return on price reductions and things like that. That said, with the advent of big data we actually are getting more sophisticated in terms of our ability to measure those returns without getting into all of the details of the things I point to on a micro level are we've been able to sustain 4% to 5% revenue growth in what's been a challenging environment. So when you add all of it up, we'll continue to invest more in advertising and marketing as we see good payback on it. As management team we are acutely focused on shareholder value creation as the meta metric for all that we do around here. And advertising and marketing is giving us good payback for the shareholders."

And all the new stuff that Gatorade is doing with the smart bottle, with the pods that are tailored for the athlete, the Gatorade prime and recover, all of that is giving more legitimacy to the brand. And I think that is driving more of the Gatorade sales. And third, I think on a competitive basis, relatively speaking, the fact that so many athletes are choosing Gatorade now is allowing Gatorade to far outdistance any emerging competitors in the space who tried to attack Gatorade just on price. And Gatorade has managed to hold its zone, in fact, extended its advantage. A combination of these 3 have served us well.

More broadly, in terms of Frito Lay performance, you saw 1, 3, 7 last year in terms of volume, revenue and profit. If you look at Frito's performance over the last 4 or 5 years, it's been remarkably consistent.

So we have a prime platform, we have a baking platform, different sort of baking platforms, and we leverage those platforms to go after all of those occasions. And I think that's what creates an advantage model within Frito-Lay. We are not in a zero-sum game within macro snacks where any growth that we get has to come at the expense of another category already participate in. In the case of Frito, we are in one category, and we, remember the old strategy of grow the core and add more, that's really what we're doing. We're looking at the demand of consumers and wondering how we can serve the demand with a Frito-Lay option. And whether its Cheetos, or its the chocolate-covered Lays that we offered or all the new products on slate for next year, I think we're just going after other macro snacking occasions. And that's why other comedies are hurting and Frito-Lay is doing well. And if you combine that with the DSD system, our part of 1 advantage, we can really get in tremendous advantage for the customers."

And if I sound funny this morning, it's because I'm nursing a very bad cold.I'm pleased to announce that PepsiCo has delivered to shareholders a terrific year in 2015 with strong organic revenue growth and 1",2005,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. And if I sound funny this morning, it's because I'm nursing a very bad cold.
I'm pleased to announce that PepsiCo has delivered to shareholders a terrific year in 2015 with strong organic revenue growth and 10% core constant currency EPS growth. We simultaneously enhanced our competitiveness and prospects for future growth, while meeting or exceeding each of the 2015 financial goals that we shared with you this time last year.
From a strategic perspective, we held or gained market share across most of our key markets. We built the strength of our brands, evidenced by both our strong organic top line growth and 40 basis point increase in A&M as a percentage of sales. We continue to extend our innovation advantage, growing new platforms, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Stacy's Pita snacks and [indiscernible] drinks in China and simultaneously invested for the future by increasing our R&D spending.
We continued to win in foodservice by adding Disney in China, Subway across several countries and renewing Yum! in China due primarily to our broad product portfolio and superior customer service. And we enhanced our offerings to our foodservice partners in 2015 through the establishment of exciting new platforms like Stubborn Soda, Mountain Dew Black Label and Hello Goodness vending. We added major new marketing properties with the NBA and the UEFA Champions League. And we expect to derive value from them through our rapidly expanding global marketing and design capabilities. And we delivered a record-setting year for productivity, as our outstanding operating teams leveraged our global supply chain center of excellence to execute best practices and new ideas with great precision across all of our businesses.
While delivering strong strategic results, we delivered financially. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and delivered 5% growth. We targeted core operating margin expansion and delivered a 30 basis point improvement. We delivered 10% core constant currency EPS growth against our initial target of 7% and converted 120% of core net income to free cash flow, excluding certain items, through strong capital management. This strong cash generation enabled us to provide attractive cash returns to our shareholders, a total of $9 billion in 2015. And our core net return on invested capital stands at 19.6% at the end of 2015, up 430 basis points over the past 3 years.
I'm particularly pleased to note that we achieved these results in the face of a challenging macro and external environment. Over my several decades in business, I have never seen this combination of sustained headwinds across most economies combined with high volatility across global financial market. From my meetings and observations traveling around the world, I have noted slowing economic growth and recession across all but the U.S. and a few other -- across the U.S. and a few other countries as a combination of geopolitics and oil have created many challenging economic outcomes. The slower economic growth has resulted in lower demand for commodities, which has put extreme pressure on previously booming economies like Russia, Canada and Brazil, just to name a few.
In order to address slowing demand, central banks have few tools to kickstart their economies, as these tools have largely been fully exploited over the past several years. In addition, increased government regulation, including increased taxation, labeling requirements and limitations on social programs are placing further pressure on consumer demand.
These macro issues have created 3 broad risks for the consumer and for CPG companies: first, the widespread economic malaise has created a strong U.S. dollar, which has the effect of creating local inflation in international markets and threaten to derail the U.S. economic recovery; second, volatile financial markets may cause a pullback in corporate investment and consumer spending; and finally, the continued weak economic performance is causing widespread political and social turmoil across the globe, which may create even greater economic harm.
In the face of these challenges, our geographic sectors managed very well during 2015, exploring the more positive environments for superior results, while carefully navigating weak environments to balance tight cost management with judicious investment to surgically capture growth.
In a relatively positive macroenvironment, our performance in North America was particularly strong with both Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages turning in very good operating and financial performances, each posted 3% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency operating profit growth for the year. Frito-Lay North America once again delivered consistent results while continuing to transform its package architecture in potato chips and its go-to-market system through further expansion of the GES program.
North American Beverages had its best financial performance in recent memory, benefiting from the continuation of improved industry pricing dynamics, a broad product portfolio and continued positive innovation performance. And Quaker Foods North America began a turnaround in 2015, delivering positive organic revenue results for the first time in several years and gaining value share across breakfast categories of hot and ready-to-eat cereal and Aunt Jemima syrup and mix.
And I'm pleased to report that PepsiCo once again was the single largest contributor to U.S. retail food and beverage growth for our customers. For the full year, we provided more growth in U.S. retail sales than the next 15 largest food and beverage manufacturers combined. And it's this success that uniquely positions us as our customers' go-to partner to drive growth.
When we look beyond North America, our international divisions clearly dealt with the lion's share of the macro challenges that I mentioned earlier. And yet despite these challenges, we were able to grow organic revenue 8% and core constant currency operating profit 6% for the year by executing effective pricing strategies, launching exciting innovative products, localizing sourcing to address FX transaction headwinds and driving productivity that provided investment funding that will propel future growth. So overall, a very good performance for the year and we believe we are well positioned as we enter 2016.
Now you may recall that we focused on one of our big performance-driving initiatives on each of the last 3 earnings calls. On our prior calls, we covered innovation supported by sensible brand management. Then we talked about flawless execution. And last time, we talked about self-sustaining productivity. Today, I want to focus on the fourth of these initiatives, cash generation and prudent capital allocation.
Now a substantial portion of our earnings converts to free cash flow, and we generate a lot of cash. In fact, over the past 3 years, we converted more than 100% of our core earnings to free cash flow and we generated more than $24 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items, including $8 billion generated in 2015 alone. More broadly, we are highly disciplined in how we allocate this cash with a particular focus on returning cash to shareholders.
Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business, not only in the form of CapEx and working capital but also within the P&L, in A&M, R&D and marketplace investment and routes and racks. In fact, since 2011, we've increased A&M as a percentage of sales by 110 basis points and R&D spending is up 40%. We have rigorous capital planning and review processes. Our CapEx investments have very attractive returns on investment, and we continually find ways to drive returns even higher by driving greater fixed asset utilization and by reducing the cost of adding capacity. Over the past 4 years, we have reduced CapEx as a percentage of sales to 4.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, which is an improvement of 60 basis points. On a revenue base of $63 billion, this equates to an annual cash savings of approximately $380 million.
Similarly, our efforts to improve our working capital have yielded positive results. Over the past 3 years, we've improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 30 days, which contributed $2.5 billion to cash flow improvement. So both our CapEx and working capital productivity have been significant contributors to our very favorable free cash flow performance.
Our second priority is to pay dividends to our shareholders. We raised our dividend for 44 consecutive years effective with the June 2016 payment. And this is through both consistent earnings growth and by raising our payout ratio over time. With this morning's announced dividend increase, we expect to pay out approximately 60% of our core 2015 earnings. And our dividend yield at yesterday's closing stock price is an attractive 3%. And our 10-year compound annual growth in dividend per share is 10%. Continuity of dividends and growth in annual dividend per share are a point of great pride for PepsiCo, and we view them as a vitally important element to the total shareholder return equation.
Our third priority is to strengthen our market positions and create value through responsible tuck-in acquisitions, generally less than $500 million a year in total, which equates to a relatively small percentage of annual free cash flow. We built a lot of capability in evaluating and integrating tuck-in acquisitions, and we have very disciplined strategic and financial guidelines to ensure that they are value-creating. Our acquisition evaluation is comprehensive and includes assessment of geographic considerations, category growth and attractiveness, scalability, competitive dynamics, people and business systems, integration, cultural fit and transaction complexity.
And our fourth capital allocation priority is to return residual cash to our shareholders through share repurchases, and we plan to do so within the confines of maintaining a capital structure that provides us ready access to the debt capital markets at attractive rates. Over the past 3 and 10 years, we've returned more than $13 billion and $35 billion, respectively, to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Next, our focus on capital allocation discipline has yielded impressive results. We returned more than $65 billion to shareholders over the past 10 years in combined dividends and share repurchases.
Before Hugh covers guidance in detail, I'll just make a few broader points about the landscape going forward. We expect continuation of the many macro challenges we faced this year, strong U.S. dollar, sluggish growth or recession in most developing and emerging markets, political and social unrest in a number of regions and increased government regulation. And as I mentioned, while the U.S. economy is experiencing a recovery, it's delicate. And there is a risk that it will not sustain itself if the rest of the globe continues to experience such maximum pressures. But even in the face of this rather challenging global landscape, I'm optimistic about PepsiCo's future. We have made a prudent appraisal of those factors outside of our control, and we are controlling those factors we can control. Our teams around the globe are executing well. Our innovation pipeline is full and promising. And the sustained investments we've made in strengthening marketing and developing cutting-edge capabilities will serve us well as we move through the year. We believe we have the plans in place for 2016 to continue to deliver strong financial results.
And we have something that's equally important as the right plans, we have the right people. The fact that we've achieved so much in what has been a protracted and extremely challenging and volatile environment is a testament to the strength and experience of our management team. We benefit greatly from a senior management team distinguished by continuity, experience and skill. Our sector heads and CFO, Al, Tom, Laxman, Ramon, Sanjeev and Hugh have 140 years of combined PepsiCo experience across multiple categories, markets and functions. And at the same time, we are developing and advancing PepsiCo's next generation of leadership. The appointments over just the past 24 months of Laxman and Ramon to their respective sector leadership roles and the appointments of Brian Newman to run global operations and Eugene Willemsen to run our global category groups are a few key examples of such next-generation leaders, who have gained tremendous experience already and have much runway ahead of them at PepsiCo.
So with these comments, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,322158045,931378,"Pepsico, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great, and good morning, everyone.Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as was said out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovatio",616,"Great, and good morning, everyone.
Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as was said out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation as well as our revenue management capabilities, driving organic revenue growth and positive net price realization. And taking our core 2015 EPS of $4.57 and applying our guidance and current foreign exchange market consensus rates implies a 2016 core EPS of approximately $4.66.
Let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. First, we will have a 53rd week in 2016, as we do every 5 or 6 years, which principally impacts our North American businesses given that our international businesses report on a monthly calendar. Our organic revenue growth outlook excludes the impact of this extra week, and our intention is to reinvest the benefit from the extra week in growth and productivity initiatives.
Second, we will be lapping the deconsolidation of our Venezuela business, which occurred at the end of Q3 in 2015. Venezuela contributed approximately $0.10 per share to core earnings in the first 3 quarters of 2015.
And third, foreign exchange translation will continue to be a headwind, with most of our key international markets' currencies expected to decline versus the U.S. dollar in 2016. Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates, this is expected to be a 4-point drag on both net revenue and core EPS.
Additionally, to the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2016, which is in line with our overall objective of achieving $5 billion of productivity over the 5 years through 2019. We anticipate continued reduction in corporate expenses, and we expect our share count to benefit from a targeted $3 billion in share repurchases.
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate continued volatile macros, especially in the developing and emerging markets. And commodity inflation is deflationary in the low single digits excluding foreign exchange and low single-digit inflationary including the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange in many of the markets whose currencies have and are expected to continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar.
Also keep in mind that because of our forward-buying approach, our commodity costs tend to lag what you see in the spot markets.
As you model out the quarters, we ask you to consider the following: We deconsolidated our Venezuela operations at the end of Q3 in 2015, so our EPS comparisons will be impacted by lapping the elimination of earnings from Venezuela during the first 3 quarters of 2016. The AMENA division will face a difficult operating profit comparison during Q1 2016, as the business laps a gain related to refranchising a portion of India bottling operations. And the benefit of the 53rd week will fall on the fourth quarter of the year, while our reinvestment of the benefit of the 53rd week will be made throughout the year.
We will maintain a high level of discipline towards capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We expect to return $4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends, and we expect to return an additional $3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases.
So combined, we expect these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $7 billion in 2016. Capital allocation is a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.
With that, we are ready to take the first question."

And it's not just emerging markets, as we travel around the world -- and let me just take a quick walk around the world. As we look at Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, if you look at Colombia, between a combination of the economic issues in the country and the currency devaluation, it's causing tremendous strain on anybody who is operating in that country, leave alone American companies have to report in U.S. dollars, because you have both a transaction and a translation problem to deal with. Transaction because a lot of the commodities we buy are denominated in dollars. So we have to figure out how to price that through. If you go over to Europe, the Western European market, I would say, did show some signs of recovery but not to the level that we would like to see it. Interestingly, our businesses in East Europe are doing well with respect to the local market but again the currency is really taking a bite out of the profit streams that come out of that market. I was in the Middle East about 3 week ago. The teams there are very resilient, but they have to cope every day with the issues in the Middle East, whether it's country is going through a tax or the refugee crisis. I mean it is pretty severe, what's going on there, and many routes have to get off the market at times. And our teams are all local, so they figure out a way to operate, but it is tough. And I think we're one of the few companies that keeps an operation going because our routes can come on quickly when there is a lull in the activity there. So I would say it's difficult to watch that region going through the problems it's going through. And as you move further east, India is holding up. The Pacific Rim is holding up nicely. Don't see too many issues. And China, going into the Chinese New Year, last year I think the market was very sluggish. But this year, it started off moderately okay. And if you ask me about how the year has started off, look, one period or one month a year does not make. But the year has started off okay. And again, I want to be very clear, what we can control, we are doing very well, execution, productivity, innovation and on the shelf, we are doing a very good job. And that's giving us some tailwinds. What we cannot control, which is the geopolitical issues, the incredible currency turmoil, we just have to accept it for the moment. And so I'd say the teams are executing very well in the marketplace, and that's why we feel cautiously optimistic on the one hand while feeling despondent about the macros on the other hand. As far as the convenience store is concerned, in the past we used to say when gas prices came down, they used to be a perceptible increase in convenience store traffic.

Revenue growth, as we've said, is about -- to be about 4%. Productivity will be about $1 billion benefit. Commodities, of course, are inflationary, low single digits. The other factors built into our numbers are: number one, we will see operating expense inflation. Recall, our bucket of OpEx is about $28 billion, a little over half of that is labor and labor will inflate somewhere around 4% for the year. In addition to that, you'll see continued investments in advertising and marketing as you have over the last couple of years, and the reason we continue to invest in that is we continue to get good returns on it. Hence the 4% to 5% revenue growth you've seen over the last couple of years. You will see higher investment in research and development as well, same answer on that. We're continuing to see good returns on that. And then, of course, with the revenue growth that we've seen over the last couple of years, we do need to invest in manufacturing lines. We need to invest in routes. We need to invest in racks to place the products on. So when you add all of those factors up and then add into that geographic mix, which is a slight drag, you wind up with a total of 8% on earnings per share growth."

And can you continue to get the pricing in developed markets that would allow you to sort of sustain that sort of, let's say, 3% to 4% pricing number going forward?"

I think there are 2 or 3 things to think about. One is in categories which are not growing robustly, like carbonated soft drinks, there you should manage pricing very carefully because there's no point trying to drop the pricing because it's not going to drive additional demand. So in that particular category, through a combination of revenue management, through a combination of intelligent price pack architecture, you just figure out how to get some pricing from the marketplace. So let's hold that on the side. Second, area where we really look for pricing is innovation. Because if there's one place where the consumer likes the news and is willing to pay up for, it's for innovation. And we've been really ramping up our innovation machine to be able to get price realization through innovation. The third is through a channel mix. And if you sell most single serve, if you sell through channels there, the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more, that clearly is a help. And lastly, even if you don't get the pricing in some places, we're going to take our costs down. So we were looking at how to reengineer our supply chain end to end, how to work with customers to rethink our supply chain. So there's a lot of work going on in our company in terms of rethinking our end-to-end costs to align our supply chains with customers, so we can mutually take out costs and then figure out a way to pass some of it to the consumer. So that's really our strategy on pricing."

So is the increased that you're making, is it PepsiCo specific against proactive opportunities? Is it against things that may be sort of deceptively encouraging for the broader industry?

As we cut across snacks and beverages, numbers went up in both categories. As we cut across the geographies, all of our geographies saw an increase in advertising and marketing spend. Number two, in terms of where is the money going, I would say that more of it is going to digital over time. The big constraint on moving more to digital is identifying high quality properties to advertise on. So it's not just a matter of going for pop-up ads any more. It's really more sophisticated digital advertising, and that is probably more than anything the rate-limiting factor is finding high quality assets to invest in. Third, as you've seen as recently as the Super Bowl this past weekend, we are investing in big properties because these big properties do enable breakthrough types of messaging. And I think we, over the last several years as well as for a longer period of time, have been quite successful in investing in those big properties. And then fourth, from a returns perspective, obviously, measuring advertising in marketing return is a little bit trickier than measuring return on price reductions and things like that. That said, with the advent of big data, we actually are getting more sophisticated in terms of our ability to measure those returns without getting into all of the details of the things I point to on a micro level are we've been able to sustain 4% to 5% revenue growth in what's been a challenging environment. So when you add all of it up, we'll continue to invest more in advertising and marketing as we see good payback on it. As management team, we are acutely focused on shareholder value creation as the meta metric for all that we do around here. And advertising and marketing is giving us good payback for the shareholders."

And all the new stuff that Gatorade is doing with the smart bottle, with the pods that are tailored for the athlete, the Gatorade prime and recover, all of that is giving more legitimacy to the brand. And I think that is driving more of the Gatorade sales. And third, I think on a competitive basis, relatively speaking, the fact that so many athletes are choosing Gatorade now is allowing Gatorade to far outdistance any emerging competitors in the space, who tried to attack Gatorade just on price. And Gatorade has managed to hold its zone and, in fact, extended its advantage. And so combination of these 3 have served us well.

And the reason Frito does as well as it does is because it takes occasions from all other macro snacking categories.

So we have a frying platform, we have a baking platform, different sort of baking platforms, and we leverage those platforms to go after all of those occasions. And I think that's what creates an advantage model within Frito-Lay. We are not in a zero-sum game within macro snacks, where any growth that we get has to come at the expense of another category already participating. In the case of Frito, we are in one category, and we in charge of the core. Remember the old strategy of grow the core and add more, that's really what we're doing. We're looking at the demand of consumers and wondering how we can serve that demand with a Frito-Lay option. And whether its Cheetos Sweetos or its the chocolate-covered Lay's that we offered or all the new products on slate for next year, I think we're just going after other macro snacking occasions. And that's why other companies are hurting and Frito-Lay is doing well. And you combine that with the DSD system, our part of 1 advantage, we can really get in tremendous advantage for the customers."

So if you think about what we are trying to accomplish, as you move South into Latin America, lot of our focus has been around making our supply chain more efficient and making our management structures more efficient. The number of the investments we made in the fourth quarter there were geared towards productivity-driving initiatives. On the other hand, in Mexico, where the outlook is more positive, the investments we made during the course of 2015 were more growth-oriented. And as we think about our outlook going forward, we expect that mix of probably stronger performance out of Mexico, more margin improving performance out of the balance of Latin America. That said, we're long-term very positive on the geography. We think we've got great market positions and great people down there.

And if I sound funny this morning, it's because I'm nursing a very bad cold.
I'm pleased to announce that PepsiCo has delivered to shareholders a terrific year in 2015 with strong organic revenue growth and 10% core constant currency EPS growth. We simultaneously enhanced our competitiveness and prospects for future growth, while meeting or exceeding each of the 2015 financial goals that we shared with you this time last year.
From a strategic perspective, we held or gained market share across most of our key markets. We built the strength of our brands, evidenced by both our strong organic top line growth and 40 basis point increase in A&M as a percentage of sales. We continued to extend our innovation advantage, growing new platforms such as Mountain Dew Kickstart, Stacy's Pita snacks and Inner Smile dairy drinks in China and simultaneously invested for the future by increasing our R&D spending.
We continued to win in foodservice by adding Disney in China, Subway across several countries and renewing Yum! in China due primarily to our broad product portfolio and superior customer service. And we enhanced our offerings to our foodservice partners in 2015 through the establishment of exciting new platforms like Stubborn Soda, Mountain Dew Black Label and Hello Goodness vending. We added major new marketing properties with the NBA and the UEFA Champions League. And we expect to derive value from them through our rapidly expanding global marketing and design capabilities. And we delivered a record-setting year for productivity, as our outstanding operating teams leveraged our global supply chain center of excellence to execute best practices and new ideas with great precision across all of our businesses.
While delivering strong strategic results, we delivered financially. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and delivered 5% growth. We targeted core operating margin expansion and delivered a 30 basis point improvement. We delivered 10% core constant currency EPS growth against our initial target of 7% and converted 120% of core net income to free cash flow, excluding certain items, through strong capital management. This strong cash generation enabled us to provide attractive cash returns to our shareholders, a total of $9 billion in 2015. And our core net return on invested capital stands at 19.6% at the end of 2015, up 430 basis points over the past 3 years.
I'm particularly pleased to note that we achieved these results in the face of a challenging macro and external environment. Over my several decades in business, I have never seen this combination of sustained headwinds across most economies combined with high volatility across global financial markets. From my meetings and observations traveling around the world, I have noted slowing economic growth and recession across all but the U.S. and a few other -- across the U.S. and a few other countries as a combination of geopolitics and oil have created many challenging economic outcomes. The slower economic growth has resulted in lower demand for commodities, which has put extreme pressure on previously booming economies like Russia, Canada and Brazil, just to name a few.
In order to address slowing demand, central banks have few tools to kickstart their economies, as these tools have largely been fully exploited over the past several years. In addition, increased government regulation, including increased taxation, labeling requirements and limitations on social programs are placing further pressure on consumer demand.
These macro issues have created 3 broad risks for the consumer and for CPG companies. First, the widespread economic malaise has created a strong U.S. dollar, which has the effect of creating local inflation in international markets and threatens to derail the U.S. economic recovery. Second, volatile financial markets may cause a pullback in corporate investment and consumer spending. And finally, the continued weak economic performance is causing widespread political and social turmoil across the globe, which may create even greater economic harm.
In the face of these challenges, our geographic sectors managed very well during 2015, exploiting the more positive environments for superior results, while carefully navigating weak environments to balance tight cost management with judicious investment to surgically capture growth.
In a relatively positive macro environment, our performance in North America was particularly strong with both Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages turning in very good operating and financial performances. Each posted 3% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency operating profit growth for the year. Frito-Lay North America once again delivered consistent results while continuing to transform its package architecture in potato chips and its go-to-market system through further expansion of the GES program.
North American Beverages had its best financial performance in recent memory, benefiting from the continuation of improved industry pricing dynamics, a broad product portfolio and continued positive innovation performance. And Quaker Foods North America began a turnaround in 2015, delivering positive organic revenue results for the first time in several years and gaining value share across its breakfast categories of hot and ready-to-eat cereal and Aunt Jemima syrup and mix.
And I'm pleased to report that PepsiCo once again was the single largest contributor to U.S. retail food and beverage growth for our customers. For the full year, we provided more growth in U.S. retail sales than the next 15 largest food and beverage manufacturers combined. And it's this success that uniquely positions us as our customers' go-to partner to drive growth.
When we look beyond North America, our international divisions clearly dealt with the lion's share of the macro challenges that I mentioned earlier. And yet despite these challenges, we were able to grow organic revenue 8% and core constant currency operating profit 6% for the year by executing effective pricing strategies, launching exciting innovative products, localizing sourcing to address FX transaction headwinds and driving productivity that provided investment funding that will propel future growth. So overall, a very good performance for the year and we believe we are well positioned as we enter 2016.
Now you may recall that we focused on one of our big performance-driving initiatives on each of the last 3 earnings calls. On our prior calls, we covered innovation supported by sensible brand management. Then we talked about flawless execution. And last time, we talked about self-sustaining productivity. Today, I want to focus on the fourth of these initiatives, cash generation and prudent capital allocation.
Now a substantial portion of our earnings converts to free cash flow, and we generate a lot of cash. In fact, over the past 3 years, we converted more than 100% of our core earnings to free cash flow and we generated more than $24 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items, including $8 billion generated in 2015 alone. More broadly, we are highly disciplined in how we allocate this cash with a particular focus on returning cash to shareholders.
Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business, not only in the form of CapEx and working capital but also within the P&L, in A&M, R&D and marketplace investment in routes and racks. In fact, since 2011, we've increased A&M as a percentage of sales by 110 basis points and R&D spending is up 40%. We have rigorous capital planning and review processes. Our CapEx investments have very attractive returns on investment, and we continually find ways to drive returns even higher by driving greater fixed asset utilization and by reducing the cost of adding capacity. Over the past 4 years, we have reduced CapEx as a percentage of sales to 4.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, which is an improvement of 60 basis points. On a revenue base of $63 billion, this equates to an annual cash savings of approximately $380 million.
Similarly, our efforts to improve our working capital have yielded positive results. Over the past 3 years, we've improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 30 days, which contributed $2.5 billion to cash flow improvement. So both our CapEx and working capital productivity have been significant contributors to our very favorable free cash flow performance.
Our second priority is to pay dividends to our shareholders. We've raised our dividend for 44 consecutive years effective with the June 2016 payment. And this is through both consistent earnings growth and by raising our payout ratio over time. With this morning's announced dividend increase, we expect to pay out approximately 60% of our core 2015 earnings. And our dividend yield at yesterday's closing stock price is an attractive 3%. And our 10-year compound annual growth in dividend per share is 10%. Continuity of dividends and growth in annual dividend per share are a point of great pride for PepsiCo, and we view them as a vitally important element to the total shareholder return equation.
Our third priority is to strengthen our market positions and create value through responsible tuck-in acquisitions, generally less than $500 million a year in total, which equates to a relatively small percentage of annual free cash flow. We've built a lot of capability in evaluating and integrating tuck-in acquisitions, and we have very disciplined strategic and financial guidelines to ensure that they are value-creating. Our acquisition evaluation is comprehensive and includes assessment of geographic considerations, category growth and attractiveness, scalability, competitive dynamics, people and business systems, integration, cultural fit and transaction complexity.
And our fourth capital allocation priority is to return residual cash to our shareholders through share repurchases, and we plan to do so within the confines of maintaining a capital structure that provides us ready access to the debt capital markets at attractive rates. Over the past 3 and 10 years, we've returned more than $13 billion and $35 billion, respectively, to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Net, our focus on capital allocation discipline has yielded impressive results. We've returned more than $65 billion to shareholders over the past 10 years in combined dividends and share repurchases.
Before Hugh covers guidance in detail, I'll just make a few broader points about the landscape going forward. We expect a continuation of the many macro challenges we face this year: a strong U.S. dollar, sluggish growth or recession in most developing and emerging markets, political and social unrest in a number of regions and increased government regulation. And as I mentioned, while the U.S. economy is experiencing a recovery, it's delicate. And there is a risk that it will not sustain itself if the rest of the globe continues to experience such massive pressures. But even in the face of this rather challenging global landscape, I'm optimistic about PepsiCo's future. We have made a prudent appraisal of those factors outside of our control, and we are controlling those factors we can control. Our teams around the globe are executing well. Our innovation pipeline is full and promising. And the sustained investments we've made in strengthening marketing and developing cutting-edge capabilities will serve us well as we move through the year. We believe we have the plans in place for 2016 to continue to deliver strong financial results.
And we have something that's equally important as the right plans: we have the right people. The fact that we've achieved so much in what has been a protracted and extremely challenging and volatile environment is a testament to the strength and experience of our management team. We benefit greatly from a senior management team distinguished by continuity, experience and skill. Our sector heads and CFO, Al, Tom, Laxman, Ramon, Sanjeev and Hugh have 140 years of combined PepsiCo experience across multiple categories, markets and functions. And at the same time, we are developing and advancing PepsiCo's next generation of leadership. The appointments over just the past 24 months of Laxman and Ramon to their respective sector leadership roles and the appointments of Brian Newman to run global operations and Eugene Willemsen to run our global category groups are a few key examples of such next-generation leaders, who have gained tremendous experience already and have much runway ahead of them at PepsiCo.
So with these comments, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,322158045,931630,"Pepsico, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great, and good morning, everyone.Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as we set out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation",616,"Great, and good morning, everyone.
Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as we set out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation as well as our revenue management capabilities, driving organic revenue growth and positive net price realization. And taking our core 2015 EPS of $4.57 and applying our guidance and current foreign exchange market consensus rates implies a 2016 core EPS of approximately $4.66.
Let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. First, we will have a 53rd week in 2016, as we do every 5 or 6 years, which principally impacts our North American businesses given that our international businesses report on a monthly calendar. Our organic revenue growth outlook excludes the impact of this extra week, and our intention is to reinvest the benefit from the extra week in growth and productivity initiatives.
Second, we will be lapping the deconsolidation of our Venezuela business, which occurred at the end of Q3 in 2015. Venezuela contributed approximately $0.10 per share to core earnings in the first 3 quarters of 2015.
And third, foreign exchange translation will continue to be a headwind, with most of our key international markets' currencies expected to decline versus the U.S. dollar in 2016. Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates, this is expected to be a 4-point drag on both net revenue and core EPS.
Additionally, to the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2016, which is in line with our overall objective of achieving $5 billion of productivity over the 5 years through 2019. We anticipate continued reduction in corporate expenses, and we expect our share count to benefit from a targeted $3 billion in share repurchases.
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate continued volatile macros, especially in the developing and emerging markets. And commodity inflation is deflationary in the low single digits excluding foreign exchange and low single-digit inflationary including the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange in many of the markets whose currencies have and are expected to continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar.
Also keep in mind that because of our forward-buying approach, our commodity costs tend to lag what you see in the spot markets.
As you model out the quarters, we ask you to consider the following. We deconsolidated our Venezuela operations at the end of Q3 in 2015, so our EPS comparisons will be impacted by lapping the elimination of earnings from Venezuela during the first 3 quarters of 2016. The AMENA division will face a difficult operating profit comparison during Q1 2016, as the business laps a gain related to refranchising a portion of India bottling operations. And the benefit of the 53rd week will fall in the fourth quarter of the year, while our reinvestment of the benefit of the 53rd week will be made throughout the year.
We will maintain a high level of discipline toward capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We expect to return $4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends, and we expect to return an additional $3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases.
So combined, we expect these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $7 billion in 2016. Capital allocation is a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.
With that, we are ready to take the first question."

As we travel around the world -- and let me just take a quick walk around the world. As we look at Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, if you look at Colombia, between a combination of the economic issues in the country and the currency devaluation, it's causing tremendous strain on anybody who is operating in that country, leave alone American companies have to report in U.S. dollars, because you have both a transaction and a translation problem to deal with. Transaction because a lot of the commodities we buy are denominated in dollars. So we have to figure out how to price that through. If you go over to Europe, the Western European market, I would say, did show some signs of recovery but not to the level that we would like to see it. Interestingly, our businesses in East Europe are doing well with respect to the local market but again the currency is really taking a bite out of the profit streams that come out of that market. I was in the Middle East about 3 week ago. The teams there are very resilient, but they have to cope every day with the issues in the Middle East, whether it's countries going through attacks or the refugee crisis. I mean it is pretty severe, what's going on there, and many routes have to get off the market at times. And our teams are all local, so they figure out a way to operate, but it is tough. And I think we're one of the few companies that keeps an operation going because our routes can come on quickly when there is a lull in the activity there. So I would say it's difficult to watch that region going through the problems it's going through. And as you move further east, India is holding up. The Pacific Rim is holding up nicely. Don't see too many issues. And China, going into the Chinese New Year, last year I think the market was very sluggish. But this year, it started off moderately okay. And if you ask me about how the year has started off, look, one period or one month a year does not make. But the year has started off okay. And again, I want to be very clear, what we can control we are doing very well, execution, productivity, innovation and on the shelf we are doing a very good job. And that's giving us some tailwinds. What we cannot control, which is the geopolitical issues, the incredible currency turmoil, we just have to accept it for the moment. And so I'd say the teams are executing very well in the marketplace, and that's why we feel cautiously optimistic on the one hand while feeling despondent about the macros on the other hand. As far as the convenience store is concerned, in the past we used to say when gas prices came down, there used to be a perceptible increase in convenience store traffic.

It makes me feel that all else equal, so if you're not cutting cost, you're not doing anything, the core business is actually shrinking, which clearly can't be with a 4% topline growth number organically for next year.

Revenue growth, as we've said, is about -- to be about 4%. Productivity will be about $1 billion benefit. Commodities, of course, are inflationary, low single digits. The other factors built into our numbers are, number one, we will see operating expense inflation. Recall, our bucket of OpEx is about $28 billion. A little over half of that is labor, and labor will inflate somewhere around 4% for the year. In addition to that, you'll see continued investments in advertising and marketing as you have over the last couple of years, and the reason we continue to invest in that is we continue to get good returns on it. Hence the 4% to 5% revenue growth you've seen over the last couple of years. You will see higher investment in research and development as well, same answer on that. We're continuing to see good returns on that. And then, of course, with the revenue growth that we've seen over the last couple of years, we do need to invest in manufacturing lines. We need to invest in routes. We need to invest in racks to place the products on. So when you add all of those factors up and then add into that geographic mix, which is a slight drag, you wind up with a total of 8% on earnings per share growth."

And so it makes sense given all the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in terms of pricing in emerging markets. I guess, the question really becomes can you sustain pricing in developed markets. Particularly given -- I know your raw materials are up slightly, but there are some deflationary raw materials and there seems to be some concern about downward pressure on pricing maybe in the U.S. So as we look at the 2015 results, low single-digit volume, a little bit more pricing, do you see that changing over time? And can you continue to get the pricing in developed markets that would allow you to sort of sustain that sort of, let's say, 3% to 4% pricing number going forward?"

I think there are 2 or 3 things to think about. One is in categories which are not growing robustly, like carbonated soft drinks, there you should manage pricing very carefully because there's no point trying to drop the pricing because it's not going to drive additional demand. So in that particular category, through a combination of revenue management, through a combination of intelligent price pack architecture, you just figure out how to get some pricing from the marketplace. So let's hold that on the side. Second area where we really look for pricing is through innovation. Because if there's one place where the consumer likes the news and is willing to pay up for, it's for innovation. And we've been really ramping up our innovation machine to be able to get price realization through innovation. The third is through a channel mix. And if you sell more single serve, if you sell through channels where the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more, that clearly is a help. And lastly, even if you don't get the pricing in some places, we've got to take our costs down. So we were looking at how to reengineer our supply chain end-to-end, how to work with customers to rethink our supply chain. So there's a lot of work going on in our company in terms of rethinking our end-to-end costs to align our supply chains with customers, so we can mutually take out costs and then figure out a way to pass some of it to the consumer. So that's really our strategy on pricing."

Is it broad-based? Is it more food versus beverage? Is it domestic versus international? Any skew would be helpful. And then more broadly, I'm just wondering if anything you're seeing out there that gives you more confidence on the margin in that spending? Because I'm struck now by how many CPG companies that have emphasized the return to AMP investment in the last few weeks. And it's just interesting against the backdrop -- the macro backdrop that as you pointed out is not getting easier. So is the increase that you're making, is it PepsiCo-specific against proactive opportunities? Is it against things that may be sort of deceptively encouraging for the broader industry? Or is any of your increase simply driven by a need to kind of keep pace and maintain share of voice versus peers that are also stepping up their investments? Any clarity there would be helpful."

As we cut across snacks and beverages, numbers went up in both categories. As we cut across the geographies, all of our geographies saw an increase in advertising and marketing spend. Number two, in terms of where is the money going, I would say that more of it is going to digital over time. The big constraint on moving more to digital is identifying high quality properties to advertise on. So it's not just a matter of going for pop-up ads any more. It's really more sophisticated digital advertising, and that is probably more than anything the rate-limiting factor is finding high quality assets to invest in. Third, as you've seen as recently as the Super Bowl this past weekend, we are investing in big properties because these big properties do enable breakthrough types of messaging. And I think we, over the last several years as well as for a longer period of time, have been quite successful in investing in those big properties. And then fourth, from a returns perspective, obviously, measuring advertising in marketing return is a little bit trickier than measuring return on price reductions and things like that. That said, with the advent of big data, we actually are getting more sophisticated in terms of our ability to measure those returns. Without getting into all of the details of it, the things I'd point to on a micro level are we've been able to sustain 4% to 5% revenue growth in what's been a challenging environment. So when you add all of it up, we'll continue to invest more in advertising and marketing as we see good payback on it. As management team, we are acutely focused on shareholder value creation as the meta metric for all that we do around here. And advertising and marketing is giving us good payback for the shareholders."

One is it was a hot year, and it was hotter for a longer period of time. And Gatorade does well in the temperatures above normal, especially for as long as it was during the year. So we shouldn't underestimate the impact of that. Second is the Gatorade innovation has been very good. Fierce and Frost alone I think contributed significantly to sales growth. And all the new stuff that Gatorade is doing with the smart bottle, with the pods that are tailored for the athlete, the Gatorade prime and recover, all of that is giving more legitimacy to the brand. And I think that is driving more of the Gatorade sales. And third, I think on a competitive basis, relatively speaking, the fact that so many athletes are choosing Gatorade now is allowing Gatorade to far outdistance any emerging competitors in the space, who tried to attack Gatorade just on price. And Gatorade has managed to hold its own and, in fact, extend its advantage. And so combination of these 3 have served us well.

The objective was to get a package that smaller households would find attractive as the primary promotional package. In that regard, the strategy has actually been quite successful and I think gotten our volume rebased in a good spot from the standpoint of how we're managing the Lay's business. More broadly, in terms of Frito Lay performance, you saw 1, 3, 7 last year in terms of volume, revenue and profit. If you look at Frito's performance over the last 4 or 5 years, it's been remarkably consistent. Volume has been around 2%, revenue has been around 4% and profit has been around 6% plus or minus a point for quite a few years.

And the reason Frito does as well as it does is because it takes occasions from all other macro snacking categories. And so, Frito's able to go after crackers, able to go after sweet occasions through interesting products that comes from a salty heritage. So we have a frying platform, we have a baking platform, different sort of baking platforms, and we leverage those platforms to go after all of those occasions. And I think that's what creates an advantage model within Frito-Lay. We are not in a zero-sum game within macro snacks, where any growth that we get has to come at the expense of another category already participating. In the case of Frito, we are in one category, and we enlarge the core. Remember the old strategy of grow the core and add more? That's really what we're doing. We're looking at the demand of consumers and wondering how we can serve that demand with a Frito-Lay option. And whether it's Cheetos Sweetos or its the chocolate-covered Lay's that we offered or all the new products on slate for next year, I think we're just going after other macro snacking occasions. And that's why other companies are hurting and Frito-Lay is doing so well.

And a number of the investments that we made in the fourth quarter there were geared towards productivity-driving initiatives. On the other hand, in Mexico, where the outlook is more positive, the investments we made during the course of 2015 were more growth-oriented.

And if I sound funny this morning, it's because I'm nursing a very bad cold.
I'm pleased to announce that PepsiCo has delivered for shareholders a terrific year in 2015 with strong organic revenue growth and 10% core constant currency EPS growth. We simultaneously enhanced our competitiveness and prospects for future growth, while meeting or exceeding each of the 2015 financial goals that we shared with you this time last year.
From a strategic perspective, we held or gained market share across most of our key markets. We built the strength of our brands, evidenced by both our strong organic top line growth and 40 basis point increase in A&M as a percentage of sales. We continued to extend our innovation advantage, growing new platforms such as Mountain Dew Kickstart, Stacy's Pita snacks and Inner Smile dairy drinks in China and simultaneously invested for the future by increasing our R&D spending.
We continued to win in foodservice by adding Disney in China, Subway across several countries and renewing Yum! in China due primarily to our broad product portfolio and superior customer service. And we enhanced our offerings to our foodservice partners in 2015 through the establishment of exciting new platforms like Stubborn Soda, MTN DEW BLACK LABEL and Hello Goodness vending. We added major new marketing properties with the NBA and the UEFA Champions League. And we expect to derive value from them through our rapidly expanding global marketing and design capabilities. And we delivered a record-setting year for productivity, as our outstanding operating teams leveraged our global supply chain center of excellence to execute best practices and new ideas with great precision across all of our businesses.
While delivering strong strategic results, we delivered financially. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and delivered 5% growth. We targeted core operating margin expansion and delivered a 30 basis point improvement. We delivered 10% core constant currency EPS growth against our initial target of 7% and converted 120% of core net income to free cash flow, excluding certain items, through strong capital management. This strong cash generation enabled us to provide attractive cash returns to our shareholders, a total of $9 billion in 2015. And our core net return on invested capital stands at 19.6% at the end of 2015, up 430 basis points over the past 3 years.
I'm particularly pleased to note that we achieved these results in the face of a challenging macro and external environment. Over my several decades in business, I have never seen this combination of sustained headwinds across most economies combined with high volatility across global financial markets. From my meetings and observations traveling around the world, I have noted slowing economic growth or recession across all but the U.S. and a few other -- across the U.S. and a few other countries as a combination of geopolitics and oil have created many challenging economic outcomes. The slower economic growth has resulted in lower demand for commodities, which has put extreme pressure on previously booming economies like Russia, Canada and Brazil, just to name a few.
In order to address slowing demand, central banks have few tools to kick start their economies, as these tools have largely been fully exploited over the past several years. In addition, increased government regulation, including increased taxation, labeling requirements and limitations on social programs are placing further pressure on consumer demand.
These macro issues have created 3 broad risks for the consumer and for CPG companies. First, the widespread economic malaise has created a strong U.S. dollar, which has the effect of creating local inflation in international markets and threatens to derail the U.S. economic recovery. Second, volatile financial markets may cause a pullback in corporate investment and consumer spending. And finally, the continued weak economic performance is causing widespread political and social turmoil across the globe, which may create even greater economic harm.
In the face of these challenges, our geographic sectors managed very well during 2015, exploiting the more positive environments for superior results, while carefully navigating weak environments to balance tight cost management with judicious investment to surgically capture growth.
In a relatively positive macro environment, our performance in North America was particularly strong with both Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages turning in very good operating and financial performances. Each posted 3% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency operating profit growth for the year. Frito-Lay North America once again delivered consistent results while continuing to transform its package architecture in potato chips and its go-to-market system through further expansion of the GES program.
North American Beverages had its best financial performance in recent memory, benefiting from the continuation of improved industry pricing dynamics, a broad product portfolio and continued positive innovation performance. And Quaker Foods North America began a turnaround in 2015, delivering positive organic revenue results for the first time in several years and gaining value share across its breakfast categories of hot and ready-to-eat cereal and Aunt Jemima syrup and mix.
And I'm pleased to report that PepsiCo once again was the single largest contributor to U.S. retail food and beverage growth for our customers. For the full year, we provided more growth in U.S. retail sales than the next 15 largest food and beverage manufacturers combined. And it's this success that uniquely positions us as our customers' go-to partner to drive growth.
When we look beyond North America, our international divisions clearly dealt with the lion's share of the macro challenges that I mentioned earlier. And yet despite these challenges, we were able to grow organic revenue 8% and core constant currency operating profit 6% for the year by executing effective pricing strategies, launching exciting innovative products, localizing sourcing to address FX transaction headwinds and driving productivity that provided investment funding that will propel future growth. So overall, a very good performance for the year and we believe we are well positioned as we enter 2016.
Now you may recall that we focused on one of our big performance-driving initiatives on each of the last 3 earnings calls. On our prior calls, we covered innovation supported by sensible brand management. Then we talked about flawless execution. And last time, we talked about self-sustaining productivity. Today, I want to focus on the fourth of these initiatives, cash generation and prudent capital allocation.
Now a substantial portion of our earnings converts to free cash flow, and we generate a lot of cash. In fact, over the past 3 years, we converted more than 100% of our core earnings to free cash flow and we generated more than $24 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items, including $8 billion generated in 2015 alone. More broadly, we are highly disciplined in how we allocate this cash with a particular focus on returning cash to shareholders.
Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business, not only in the form of CapEx and working capital but also within the P&L, in A&M, R&D and marketplace investment in routes and racks. In fact, since 2011, we've increased A&M as a percentage of sales by 110 basis points and R&D spending is up 40%. We have rigorous capital planning and review processes. Our CapEx investments have very attractive returns on investment, and we continually find ways to drive returns even higher by driving greater fixed asset utilization and by reducing the cost of adding capacity. Over the past 4 years, we have reduced CapEx as a percentage of sales to 4.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, which is an improvement of 60 basis points. On a revenue base of $63 billion, this equates to an annual cash savings of approximately $380 million.
Similarly, our efforts to improve our working capital have yielded positive results. Over the past 3 years, we've improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 30 days, which contributed $2.5 billion to cash flow improvement. So both our CapEx and working capital productivity have been significant contributors to our very favorable free cash flow performance.
Our second priority is to pay dividends to our shareholders. We've raised our dividend for 44 consecutive years effective with the June 2016 payment, and this is through both consistent earnings growth and by raising our payout ratio over time. With this morning's announced dividend increase, we expect to pay out approximately 60% of our core 2015 earnings. And our dividend yield at yesterday's closing stock price is an attractive 3% and our 10-year compound annual growth in dividend per share is 10%. Continuity of dividends and growth in annual dividend per share are a point of great pride for PepsiCo, and we view them as a vitally important element to the total shareholder return equation.
Our third priority is to strengthen our market positions and create value through responsible tuck-in acquisitions, generally less than $500 million a year in total, which equates to a relatively small percentage of annual free cash flow. We've built a lot of capability in evaluating and integrating tuck-in acquisitions, and we have very disciplined strategic and financial guidelines to ensure that they're value-creating. Our acquisition evaluation is comprehensive and includes assessment of geographic considerations, category growth and attractiveness, scalability, competitive dynamics, people and business systems, integration, cultural fit and transaction complexity.
And our fourth capital allocation priority is to return residual cash to our shareholders through share repurchases, and we plan to do so within the confines of maintaining a capital structure that provides us ready access to the debt capital markets at attractive rates. Over the past 3 and 10 years, we've returned more than $13 billion and $35 billion, respectively, to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Net, our focus on capital allocation discipline has yielded impressive results. We've returned more than $65 billion to shareholders over the past 10 years in combined dividends and share repurchases.
Before Hugh covers guidance in detail, I'll just make a few broader points about the landscape going forward. We expect a continuation of the many macro challenges we face this year: a strong U.S. dollar, sluggish growth or recession in most developing and emerging markets, political and social unrest in a number of regions and increased government regulation. And as I mentioned, while the U.S. economy is experiencing a recovery, it's delicate. And there is a risk that it will not sustain itself if the rest of the globe continues to experience such massive pressures. But even in the face of this rather challenging global landscape, I'm optimistic about PepsiCo's future. We have made a prudent appraisal of those factors outside of our control, and we are controlling those factors we can control. Our teams around the globe are executing well. Our innovation pipeline is full and promising. And the sustained investments we've made in strengthening marketing and developing cutting-edge capabilities will serve us well as we move through the year. We believe we have the plans in place for 2016 to continue to deliver strong financial results.
And we have something that's equally important as the right plans: we have the right people. The fact that we've achieved so much in what has been a protracted and extremely challenging and volatile environment is a testament to the strength and experience of our management team. We benefit greatly from a senior management team distinguished by continuity, experience and skill. Our sector heads and CFO, Al, Tom, Laxman, Ramon, Sanjeev and Hugh have 140 years of combined PepsiCo experience across multiple categories, markets and functions. And at the same time, we are developing and advancing PepsiCo's next generation of leadership. The appointments over just the past 24 months of Laxman and Ramon to their respective sector leadership roles and the appointments of Brian Newman to run global operations and Eugene Willemsen to run our global category groups are a few key examples of such next-generation leaders, who have gained tremendous experience already and have much runway ahead of them at PepsiCo.
So with these comments, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,322158045,955978,"Pepsico, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great, and good morning, everyone.Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as we set out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation",616,"Great, and good morning, everyone.
Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as we set out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4% with the top line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation as well as our revenue management capabilities, driving organic revenue growth and positive net price realization. And taking our core 2015 EPS of $4.57 and applying our guidance and current foreign exchange market consensus rates implies a 2016 core EPS of approximately $4.66.
Let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. First, we will have a 53rd week in 2016, as we do every 5 or 6 years, which principally impacts our North American businesses given that our international businesses report on a monthly calendar. Our organic revenue growth outlook excludes the impact of this extra week, and our intention is to reinvest the benefit from the extra week in growth and productivity initiatives.
Second, we will be lapping the deconsolidation of our Venezuela business, which occurred at the end of Q3 in 2015. Venezuela contributed approximately $0.10 per share to core earnings in the first 3 quarters of 2015.
And third, foreign exchange translation will continue to be a headwind, with most of our key international markets' currencies expected to decline versus the U.S. dollar in 2016. Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates, this is expected to be a 4-point drag on both net revenue and core EPS.
Additionally, to the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2016, which is in line with our overall objective of achieving $5 billion of productivity over the 5 years through 2019. We anticipate continued reduction in corporate expenses, and we expect our share count to benefit from a targeted $3 billion in share repurchases.
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate continued volatile macros, especially in the developing and emerging markets. And commodity inflation is deflationary in the low single digits excluding foreign exchange and low single-digit inflationary including the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange in many of the markets whose currencies have and are expected to continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar.
Also keep in mind that because of our forward-buying approach, our commodity costs tend to lag what you see in the spot markets.
As you model out the quarters, we ask you to consider the following. We deconsolidated our Venezuela operations at the end of Q3 in 2015, so our EPS comparisons will be impacted by lapping the elimination of earnings from Venezuela during the first 3 quarters of 2016. The AMENA division will face a difficult operating profit comparison during Q1 2016, as the business laps a gain related to refranchising a portion of India bottling operations. And the benefit of the 53rd week will fall in the fourth quarter of the year, while our reinvestment of the benefit of the 53rd week will be made throughout the year.
We will maintain a high level of discipline toward capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We expect to return $4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends, and we expect to return an additional $3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases.
So combined, we expect these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $7 billion in 2016. Capital allocation is a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.
With that, we are ready to take the first question."

As we travel around the world -- and let me just take a quick walk around the world. As we look at Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, if you look at Colombia, between a combination of the economic issues in the country and the currency devaluation, it's causing tremendous strain on anybody who is operating in that country, leave alone American companies have to report in U.S. dollars, because you have both a transaction and a translation problem to deal with. Transaction because a lot of the commodities we buy are denominated in dollars. So we have to figure out how to price that through. If you go over to Europe, the Western European market, I would say, did show some signs of recovery but not to the level that we would like to see it. Interestingly, our businesses in East Europe are doing well with respect to the local market but again the currency is really taking a bite out of the profit streams that come out of that market. I was in the Middle East about 3 weeks ago. The teams there are very resilient, but they have to cope every day with the issues in the Middle East, whether it's countries going through attacks or the refugee crisis. I mean it is pretty severe what's going on there, and many routes have to get off the market at times. And our teams are all local, so they figure out a way to operate, but it is tough. And I think we're one of the few companies that keeps an operation going because our routes can come on quickly when there's a lull in the activity there. So I would say it's difficult to watch that region going through the problems it's going through. And as you move further east, India is holding up. The Pacific Rim is holding up nicely, don't see too many issues. And China, going into the Chinese New Year, last year I think the market was very sluggish. But this year, it started off moderately okay. And if you ask me about how the year has started off, look, 1 period or 1 month a year does not make. But the year has started off okay. And again, I want to be very clear, what we can control we are doing very well, execution, productivity, innovation and on the shelf we are doing a very good job. And that's giving us some tailwinds. What we cannot control, which is the geopolitical issues, this incredible currency turmoil, we just have to accept it for the moment. And so I'd say the teams are executing very well in the marketplace, and that's why we feel cautiously optimistic on the one hand while feeling despondent about the macros on the other hand.

A little over half of that is labor, and labor will inflate somewhere around 4% for the year. In addition to that, you'll see continued investments in advertising and marketing as you have over the last couple of years, and the reason we continue to invest in that is we continue to get good returns on it, hence the 4% to 5% revenue growth you've seen over the last couple of years. You will see higher investment in research and development as well, same answer on that. We're continuing to see good returns on that. And then, of course, with the revenue growth that we've seen over the last couple of years, we do need to invest in manufacturing lines. We need to invest in routes. We need to invest in racks to place the products on. So when you add all of those factors up and then add into that geographic mix, which is a slight drag, you wind up with a total of 8% on earnings per share growth."

And can you continue to get the pricing in developed markets that would allow you to sort of sustain that sort of, let's say, 3% to 4% pricing number going forward?"

One is in categories which are not growing robustly, like carbonated soft drinks. There, you should manage pricing very carefully because there's no point trying to drop the pricing because it's not going to drive additional demand. So in that particular category, through a combination of revenue management, through a combination of intelligent price pack architecture, you just figure out how to get some pricing from the marketplace. So let's hold that on the side. Second, the area where we really look for pricing is through innovation. Because if there's one place where the consumer likes the news and is willing to pay up for, it's for innovation. And we've been really ramping up our innovation machine to be able to get price realization through innovation. The third is through a channel mix. And if you sell more single serve, if you sell through channels where the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more, that clearly is a help. And lastly, even if you don't get the pricing in some places, we've got to take our costs down. So we've been looking at how to reengineer our supply chain end-to-end, how to work with customers to rethink our supply chain. So there's a lot of work going on in our company in terms of rethinking our end-to-end costs to align our supply chains with customers, so we can mutually take out costs and then figure out a way to pass some of it to the consumer. So that's really our strategy on pricing."

And it's just interesting against the backdrop -- the macro backdrop that as you pointed out is not getting easier. So is the increase that you're making, is it PepsiCo-specific against proactive opportunities? Is it against things that may be sort of deceptively encouraging for the broader industry? Or is any of your increase simply driven by a need to kind of keep pace and maintain share of voice versus peers that are also stepping up their investments? Any clarity there would be helpful."

As we cut across snacks and beverages, numbers went up in both categories. As we cut across the geographies, all of our geographies saw an increase in advertising and marketing spend. Number two, in terms of where is the money going, I would say that more of it is going to digital over time. The big constraint on moving more to digital is identifying high quality properties to advertise on. So it's not just a matter of going for pop-up ads anymore. It's really more sophisticated digital advertising, and that is probably more than anything the rate-limiting factor is finding high quality assets to invest in. Third, as you've seen as recently as the Super Bowl this past weekend, we are investing in big properties because these big properties do enable breakthrough types of messaging. And I think we, over the last several years as well as for a longer period of time, have been quite successful in investing in those big properties. And then fourth, from a returns perspective, obviously, measuring advertising in marketing return is a little bit trickier than measuring return on price reductions and things like that. That said, with the advent of big data, we actually are getting more sophisticated in terms of our ability to measure those returns. Without getting into all of the details of it, the things I'd point to on a macro level are we've been able to sustain 4% to 5% revenue growth in what's been a challenging environment. So when you add all of it up, we'll continue to invest more in advertising and marketing as we see good payback on it.

And Gatorade does well when the temperature's above normal, especially for as long as it was during the year. So we shouldn't underestimate the impact of that. Second is the Gatorade innovation has been very good. Fierce and Frost alone I think contributed significantly to sales growth. And all the new stuff that Gatorade is doing with the smart bottle, with the pods that are tailored for the athlete, the Gatorade prime and recover, all of that is giving more legitimacy to the brand, and I think that is driving more of the Gatorade sales. And third, I think on a competitive basis, relatively speaking, the fact that so many athletes are choosing Gatorade now is allowing Gatorade to far outdistance any emerging competitors in the space, who tried to attack Gatorade just on price. And Gatorade has managed to hold its own and, in fact, extend its advantage. And so combination of these 3 have served us well. Going into 2016, I think we'll keep the pedal to the metal on innovation, on execution and hope the weather holds up. That's the best we can do. So Frito, Hugh?"

So from a Frito perspective, Bill, I assume your question is around the potato chip promotional package moving from the XXL to the XL bag. That probably cost us from a volume perspective about a point. Recall that the reason for the strategy, as we talked earlier this -- or during last year, was to increase household penetration with smaller household sizes. The objective was to get a package that smaller households would find attractive as the primary promotional package. In that regard, the strategy has actually been quite successful and I think gotten our volume rebased in a good spot from the standpoint of how we're managing the Lay's business. More broadly, in terms of Frito Lay performance, you saw 1%, 3%, 7% last year in terms of volume, revenue and profit. If you look at Frito's performance over the last 4 or 5 years, it's been remarkably consistent. Volume has been around 2%, revenue has been around 4% and profit has been around 6% plus or minus a point for quite a few years. I think you can continue, even as we invest and make changes in Frito, you can expect to see that type of performance going forward."

And the reason Frito does as well as it does is because it takes occasions from all other macro snacking categories. And so, Frito's able to go after crackers, able to go after sweet occasions through interesting products that comes from a salty heritage. So we have a frying platform, we have a baking platform, different sort of baking platforms, and we leverage those platforms to go after all of those occasions. And I think that's what creates an advantage model within Frito-Lay. We are not in a zero-sum game within macro snacks, where any growth that we get has to come at the expense of another category already participating. In the case of Frito, we are in one category, and we enlarge [ph] the core. Remember the old strategy of grow the core and add more? That's really what we're doing. We're looking at the demand of consumers and wondering how we can serve that demand with a Frito-Lay option. And whether it's Cheetos Sweetos or its the chocolate-covered Lay's that we offered or all the new products on slate for next year, I think we're just going after other macro snacking occasions. And that's why other companies are hurting and Frito-Lay is doing so well. And you combine that with our DSD system, our Power of One advantage, we can really get an tremendous advantage with customers."

So if you think about what we are trying to accomplish, as you move south into Latin America, a lot of our focus has been around making our supply chain more efficient and making our management structures more efficient. And a number of the investments that we made in the fourth quarter there were geared towards productivity-driving initiatives. On the other hand, in Mexico, where the outlook is more positive, the investments we made during the course of 2015 were more growth-oriented. And as we think about our outlook going forward, we expect that mix of probably stronger performance out of Mexico, more margin-improving performance out of the balance of Latin America.

I'm pleased report that 2016 is off to a good start with very strong operating results in the first quarter.

I'm pleased report that 2016 is off to a good start with very strong operating results in the first quarter. Global snacks organic volume increased by 1.5%, and global beverage organic volume increased 3%, the highest rate of quarterly beverage volume growth in 3 years. We delivered 3.5% organic revenue growth, led by high single digit growth in Latin America and AMENA and 4% growth at Frito-Lay North America. Our 5 largest segments, Frito-Lay North America, North American Beverages, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA each had both positive organic volume growth and positive net pricing. 
Core gross margins expanded by 130 basis points, and core operating margins expanded by 165 basis points, driven by the positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program. Core constant currency operating profit grew 12%, and core constant currency EPS grew 11%. 
It is noteworthy that we delivered these results in a volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment. Most of the developed world outside the United States is grappling with slow growth. GDP growth in developing and emerging markets is also challenged, with many DNA [ph] market experiencing significant political unrest and high unemployment. Key energy-producing countries are dealing with significant budgetary gaps, and high levels of local inflation in many of these markets are railroading disposal income and dampening consumer spending. It's a difficult environment indeed. 
Despite these macro challenges, we performed well. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue 7%, with double-digit growth in China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey. In the developed markets, we grew organic revenue by 2%, led by performance in the United States where we grew revenue 2.5%. 
In fact, in the first quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth than the next 17 largest manufacturers combined. We have performed well because our approach to operating in this environment is and has been: to execute well against what we can control and to retool our business models and operating system, to cope with what we believe could be sustained volatility and uncertainty. 
And this is really what we're doing. First, we have accelerated our innovation agenda, utilizing our proprietary demands basis framework. This has led to our new products being more incremental and has contributed significantly to our overall organic revenue growth. We've increased the efficiency and effectiveness of new product launches by leveraging our global scale. We are more quickly and effectively lifting and adapting successful product launches from 1 market to another, driving more rapid expansion of our largest brands as well as our future billion dollar brands. 
For example, in the first quarter, outside of North America, Lipton drink tea grew 10%. Mountain Dew grew volume 9%. Gatorade grew 9%. Naked Juice grew 60%. Sunbites grew 42%. And Cheetos grew 9%. We have continued to generate strong net price realization even in a sluggish consumer environment through enhanced revenue management capabilities and data analytics. We've introduced new price pack combinations tailored to much more targeted shopper and consumer locations. 
For example, in North America, over the past 5 years, we have shifted approximately 6% of our carbonated soft drink volume mix from traditional 2 liter and 12-ounce multipack packages to higher margin, more profitable singleserve and alternative multi-serve packages. These efforts have been driving higher net price realization for us and our retail partners.
We have also been future-proofing our product portfolio, reshaping it to capitalize on consumers' increasing interest in health and wellness. Just to give you an idea, we track 2 sets of numbers. First, what we view as everyday nutrition, which includes products that provide positive nutrients like grains, fruit and vegetables and protein, plus those products that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea. Now these products account for almost 25% of our portfolio by revenue. 
Second, what we view as guilt-free products. These include the everyday nutrition products plus diet beverages and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. Guilt-free products account for approximately 45% of our portfolio by revenue. 
The growth of our everyday nutrition products, which accounts for 1/4 of our global net revenue, is outpacing the growth of the balance of the portfolio. And we've had a significant amount of activity underway to transform our portfolio. Just to give you a few examples. We've broadened our beverage portfolio to lessen our reliance on colas. And today, we have the leading non-carbonated beverage portfolio in the United States. In fact, globally, just 12% of our revenues comes from trademark Pepsi and less than 25% comes from carbonated soft drinks on a global basis.
We've invested in R&D to create advantaged sweetness solutions and lower calorie products, and we are aggressively moving our portfolio to package and product combinations with fewer calories. Mountain Dew Kickstart, which is 40 calories per 8 ounces is a great example of our execution in this area. Now in its third year, Kickstart generated more than $300 million in estimated retail sales in 2015 and posted a 34% volume growth in the first quarter of 2016. 
We've also been shifting more of our beverage A&M to lower-calorie products in order to accelerate growth and strategically advantage subcategories. And we've increased the nutritional profile of our snacks and foods through the introduction of products like Smartfood Delights, which grew volume over 75% in the first quarter; Reduced Fat Doritos, the top-selling Frito-Lay snack vend schools which grew volume 30% in the first quarter; and gluten-free Quaker Oats, just to name a few. Net-net, we feel pretty good about our portfolio transformation efforts.
Next, we are building and investing in new capabilities to win in high-growth channels. To capitalize on increased out-of-home food and beverage consumption, we have consolidated our foodservice resources into 1 team, enabling us to creatively leverage the breadth of our portfolio with our customers and consumers. In the United States, foodservice now represents approximately 14% of our total revenue and the first quarter outpaced the growth of the balance of our other channels combined. This year, we will be increasingly out-of-home availability of our everyday nutrition products, both snacks and beverages, through a targeted placement of approximately 20,000 Hello Goodness vending machines across North America.
Our advertising and marketing has also become more impactful. First, we've stepped up our level of investment from 5.2% of sales in 2011 to 6.3% of sales in 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, our A&M expense increased by a further 65 basis points as a percentage of sales versus the prior-year quarter. At the same time, we've increased the effectiveness of our A&M investment by shifting more dollars into consumer-facing, working A&M and by more effectively integrating social and digital media in our marketing campaigns.
We've also accelerated our productivity programs, contributing to consistent core margin expansion and providing investment funding for growth initiatives. Since 2012, we have generated approximately $1 billion of annual productivity savings, and we are on pace to do so again this year. In addition, we have fully implemented our zero-based Smart Spending program across the enterprise. We are already seeing significant expense reductions in the areas targeted, and our organization is fully mobilized to identify opportunities to drive even greater levels of productivity.
And then we've stepped up our market-based execution by working in creative new ways with our retail partners, like unique joint execution sports and entertainment properties, development of new and innovative merchandising and fountain equipment, execution of coordinated consumer promotions and leveraging the combined power of the PepsiCo product portfolio. So for example, with 7-Eleven, Doritos and Super Bowl all turning 50 this year, in the first quarter we teamed up to offer consumers NFL experiences and prices, including a trip to Super Bowl 50. When consumers purchase a golden combo of any size Doritos, Pepsi, Slurpee or grill item, they could scan their 7-Eleven after receive of code to unlock prices from teamupforgold.com. At Albertsons we executed a joint promotion across PepsiCo's entire product portfolio in the all for Super Bowl sweepstakes, there was a massive of blitz of in-store displays, in circular advertising and online promotions. When consumers purchase 2 or more participating products in 1 transaction, they qualify to enter to win $50,000, 1 of 50 nflshop.com gift cards every week during the promotion period. These examples are by no means exception to the rule. They're just a couple of demonstrations of how we are working creatively and collaboratively to deliver value to the consumer and be an indispensable growth partner for our retailers. 
The actions we've taken and the investments we've made to strengthen our capabilities, our innovation, revenue management, portfolio transformation, customer service initiatives, in particular, is what helped us deliver impressive operating results in the first quarter. We continue to achieve healthy net revenue realization and new products continue to be an important contributor to our sales growth.
Next, in the context of an interesting macro backdrop, we feel good about the state of our business and we're off to a good start in 2016. We believe we have the right plans in place. We have great people. We are executing well. We are investing in capabilities that propel our future growth. We will continue to leverage our considerable advantages, our scale, geographic presence, product portfolio and Power of One synergies to succeed in this environment. And we're well positioned to achieve our 2016 financial targets. 
Many of our investors have commented to me that they value PepsiCo because of our sustained reliable performance. As stewards of this remarkable 50-plus year old enterprise, we are managing and investing the business to extend the duration of performance while achieving returns above our cost of capital. And we're committed to ensuring that our best years are ahead of us. With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"
32854,328650933,959081,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first quarter and having a good start to the year with 1 quarter behind us gives us added confidence in achieving the financial targets we s",506,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first quarter and having a good start to the year with 1 quarter behind us gives us added confidence in achieving the financial targets we shared with you in February. And so, as you saw in this morning's release, we reaffirmed those targets. Specifically, we expect approximately 4% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, and we expect 8% core constant currency EPS growth, excluding the impact of deconsolidating our Venezuela operations and 6% when including the Venezuela impact. 
Notwithstanding our strong Q1 results, the macro outlook remains highly volatile and uncertain and, for this reason, we are maintaining a cautious stance on the external factors that influence our business. So balancing a positive view of our execution against a more negative view of the macros, we arrived at the conclusion to keep our revenue and earnings guidance unchanged. 
We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both revenue and EPS by approximately 4 percentage points, which is also unchanged from the full year estimate we provided to you last quarter. As a reminder, we based our foreign exchange translation forecast on consensus rates. I know a number of you use spot rates, which currently lead you to a less significant impact. Clearly, as the year progresses, this gap will resolve itself, but we're holding to our outlook at a negative impact of 4% for the year for both revenue and EPS. As a result, we continue to expect 2016 core EPS of $4.66.
Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set out in this morning's release. For the analysts on the call, as you update your models, I'd ask that you consider the following factors: We have a more difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the upcoming quarters at both Frito-Lay North America and North America Beverages. We anticipate a slower rate of gross margin expansion versus Q1 as we expect raw material inflation, which includes the impact of translate -- transaction-related foreign exchange for the balance of the year compared to modest deflation in Q1. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including a planned increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. While we expect lower corporate expenses for the full year, primarily driven by lower pension costs, there will be quarterly volatility in this line item due to timing, and you should not expect to see the rate of decline that we had in Q1 for the full year. The reinvestment of the 53rd week benefit will occur over the balance of the year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela earnings of approximately $0.03 per share in Q2 and $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect balance of year EPS growth to be disproportionately weighted toward the fourth quarter. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

So I was just hoping for an update on your level of visibility you can hit 4% organic sales growth for the year, particularly as pricing moderates internationally with less FX pressure and your lap over some of the pricing changes in potato chips and beverages theoretically moderates a bit. And then also if you could just comment specifically on the North American carbonated soft drink pricing environment, the 1% NAB result is below what we saw last year.

And based on the innovation pipeline, based on the execution capability of our businesses and knowing what we've sold into customers around the world, both on retail and foodservice, at this point we feel optimistic about our revenue guidance for the year. Again, this is based on everything that we can control and based on our assessment of the tough macro economic environment as we see today. So I'd say as the year progresses, we'll know more. But we feel reasonably optimistic about our 4% earnings guidance for the year [indiscernible] revenue, pardon me. Let me now turn to the North American pricing. Again, when we look at 1% pricing, it's really rounded down. It was closer to 1.5%. And again, we are just now entering the season, so based on what we've seen in the market, we actually quite a lot of discipline in pricing. And our hope is that given the dynamics of the CSD category in particular, that there will be continued disciplined based mostly on revenue management and careful mix management, and that's really what we're focused on. And our goal is to make sure that we don't do anything crazy on pricing because pricing actions don't really drive volume growth. So we're just making sure that we focus on mix management or revenue management to keep getting the positive price realization going through the year."

And right now, with the launch of lots of premium beverages and launch of premium products coming out of Frito-Lay, we are getting good price realization, and that's core. And clearly, when you do revenue management, even shifting to smaller packages, mini cans, you don't get much volume lift but you get revenue lift. And I think, as I look into the future, I think you're going to see some volume growth. You're going to see effective mix management, both from a revenue management perspective and the product portfolio itself giving us robust revenue growth.

The population, the demographics are pretty good. And when the country performs well, things are good. But recently, in the last, I'd say, 12 to 18 months, there's been a lot of self-induced problems in Brazil. And then the slowdown in China clearly has had an impact on Brazil because Brazil was the commodity supplier to the robust growth in China. And so it's going to take some time for Brazil to get through its issues, its own political problems and then of course the global commodity price slump right now. So we are cautious in our approach to Brazil, focused more on value products and, where we can get some premium pricing in, we try to get it in. But Brazil has been, I think, globally Brazil is one of the toughest economic situations today. In the case of Russia, our core business is doing quite well because it's one of those markets where we have a spectacular portfolio, very balanced between all day parts, between Good-for-You products, Fun-for-You, Better-for-You, it's a wonderful balance of products we have in Russia. And the Russian consumers are good consumer, and we have a scale business covering all of Russia. I think the 2 issues are impacting Russia. One is the ruble, where it stands because when you have dollar-denominated costs coming into Russia, clearly it squeezes the middle of the P&L and you can't price enough to cover all of it because the Russian consumer, which brings you to the second point, Russian consumer wages are not going up as much as the cost of living bucket suggests it should go up. So there's a bit of a squeeze going on. But all things considered, our team in Russia is mostly Russian doing a very, very good job navigating through these issues in Russia. And I must say, but for these global macro conditions, especially the strength of the dollar squeezing the cost structure, we have a good business in Russia, and the team is doing a good job running it right now."

So let me start off by saying, Caroline, that Tingyi is still the leader in the beverage market in China, still has the most phenomenal infrastructure, widely covers China with all manufacturing technologies Goldfield, aseptic, waterline, you name it. They're an amazing scale player. And they remain a valuable partner to PepsiCo. I think Tingyi has been impacted by a couple of 3 issues, and they're a public company, you've seen all their disclosures and announcements, I'm not going to share with you anything that you don't know. But basically, the slowdown in the Chinese market for beverages overall driven by the macros. And some of the operational issues that Tingyi has had to cope with because of the changes they were making to make their system more efficient has taken a short-term hit in performance. And I think the readthrough has been that we, too, took a bit of a marginal hit in beverages in our performance, as we've talked about openly in our earnings calls. But having said that, within China, we have a very good business in foods and nutrition. And our beverage business, sequentially, is beginning to develop. So we remain cautiously optimistic. As far as our partnership with Tingyi is concerned, look, our ownership was based on a price that we recorded when we first did the transaction. Since that time, the overall Chinese market has come down a lot, a lot. And secondly, because of Tingyi's own performance, their stock has come down quite a bit, and so we felt it was prudent to mark down the value of our investment. Having said that, we remain very committed to the Tingyi partnership. And once they get through their issues, which they have to get through, we can help them, but they're a public company, we'll be back to a partnership that continues to [indiscernible]."

I think it's safe to assume that we'll continue to get good solid pricing in those markets. I understand what you're pointing out is as dollar-based commodities become less inflationary in local terms, will we continue to get the same level of commodity-driven pricing? Remains to be seen. Part of our pricing is obviously driven by commodities, part of it is driven by what else is happening in the local economy. To the degree that pricing is less, I do expect that we'll see some volume bounce back because in those markets, when you have emerging consumers that are entering the categories, obviously, as we take less price, we tend to increase adoption more rapidly. So I think we probably will see a bit more volume and a bit less price in developing and emerging markets in the back half of the year, but that remains to be seen. The outlook, as we've talked about earlier, is not just not overly positive, it's also quite uncertain. Regarding mix versus rate, I assume that's a North America beverage question because that's a tough one to answer globally. About 2/3 of the pricing benefit that we saw in the first quarter was rate and about 1/3 was mix. So we continue to see good balance. In fact, if anything, we'd probably got a little bit more rate than we have been getting in the previous quarters."

So what I'm going to give you is what we expect the year to come in at. And last year, we came very close to that 9% number. And typically what we look for within that is sort of a 75% line extensions, what we call refresh innovation because news drives growth in this category. Then 25% we'd like to be sort of reframe and breakthrough, which is new platforms or substantially new packaging that can take the business to a whole new level. And again, across the world, this number varies, but roughly speaking, that's what we shoot for. And the things we is about Kickstart was a new platform, but after a couple of years, it becomes part of the base of the company and then we have to rely on flavor extensions to continue to drive it. And so something that's reframe or breakthrough the first year, after a couple of 3 years has to go back into the base and start getting countered and refreshed. So really how we count innovation is really stuff that's been launched and in the markets for these 2 years. And we look at the performance of that business on a rolling basis.

Let me talk about pricing. Ali, I can only talk about what we're going to do. I believe is that it's very important that you really execute price rationally in the market because when you drop the price too much, it doesn't drive that much consumption growth, volume growth. I think we're at the point in the market in many of our categories where you can roll the business through premiumization real innovation, but just playing a price game does not drive volume growth and actually destroys value. So that's our strategy, and that's the playbook that we're going to execute. Let me turn to Tingyi. I think I gave you a pretty complete answer when Caroline asked the question, but let me just add to it. You've seen the Tingyi results. You've heard there call. You've heard all of the news that comes out of Tingyi, so I'm not going to talk about a public company that announced its results on its own. I'll just tell you that from my perspective, or our perspective, clearly, the macro economics has played a role. I think Tingyi itself is trying to retool itself to become more efficient. And whenever you're going to do a transformation retooling, there's going to be disruption to the business. And finally, the PepsiCo Tingyi partnerships very well, and I think it will come right back to where it was intended to be. The transition where we consolidate distribution systems, where we sought out products between PepsiCo oriented distribution system or premium products oriented distribution system versus the value-oriented products distribution system, that transition is taking a little bit longer, it's a little bit more painful. And I wish it could happen faster, but that's the reality of what we're living with because the slowdown in the macros has not helped either. So from a Tingyi perspective, as I said, we remain optimistic, and we just need to power through this and provide the help in terms of capabilities and the knowledge transfer to them so they can get through the difficulties yet. And I don't think Tingyi is indicative of any problems on a global basis. I'll tell you something, we have hundreds of partners globally in the beverage business. At any point, some percentage of those bottomless go through issues. That's the same for any company in this beverage business. And the strength of the franchise company is how do you help that bottling entity recover from its issues given that we operate and we have a reservoir of capabilities. That's really what we're doing, taking people from our established, sending them into these bottle businesses to help them improve their performance. So I don't see any major red flags here, Ali."

Number two, Smart Spending continues to present an opportunity to enhance margins. And again, that occurs across all of our businesses.

32854,328650933,959113,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jamie. I'm pleased report that 2016 is off to a good start with very strong operating results in the first quarter. Global snacks organic volume increased by 1.5%, and global beverage organic volume increased 3%, the highest rate of quarterly b",1674,"Thank you, Jamie. I'm pleased report that 2016 is off to a good start with very strong operating results in the first quarter. Global snacks organic volume increased by 1.5%, and global beverage organic volume increased 3%, the highest rate of quarterly beverage volume growth in 3 years. We delivered 3.5% organic revenue growth, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America and AMENA and 4% growth at Frito-Lay North America. Our 5 largest segments, Frito-Lay North America, North American Beverages, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA, each had both positive organic volume growth and positive net pricing. 
Core gross margins expanded by 130 basis points, and core operating margins expanded by 165 basis points, driven by the positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program. Core constant-currency operating profit grew 12%, and core constant-currency EPS grew 11%. 
It is noteworthy that we delivered these results in a volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment. Most of the developed world outside the United States is grappling with slow growth. GDP growth in developing and emerging markets is also challenged, with many D&E markets experiencing significant political unrest and high unemployment. Key energy-producing countries are dealing with significant budgetary gaps, and high levels of local inflation in many of these markets are rerouting disposable income and dampening consumer spending. It's a difficult environment indeed. 
Despite these macro challenges, we performed well. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue 7%, with double-digit growth in China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey. In the developed markets, we grew organic revenue by 2%, led by performance in the United States, where we grew revenue 2.5%. 
In fact, in the first quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth than the next 17 largest manufacturers combined. 
We have performed well because our approach to operating in this environment is and has been: to execute well against what we can control and to retool our business models and operating system to cope with what we believe could be sustained volatility and uncertainty. And this is really what we are doing. First, we have accelerated our innovation agenda, utilizing our proprietary demand spaces framework. This has led to our new products being more incremental and has contributed significantly to our overall organic revenue growth. 
We have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of new product launches by leveraging our global scale. We are more quickly and effectively lifting and adapting successful product launches from one market to another, driving more rapid expansion of our largest brands as well as our future billion-dollar brands. For example, in the first quarter, outside of North America, Lipton ready-to-drink tea grew 10%, Mountain Dew grew volume 9%, Gatorade grew 9%, Naked Juice grew 60%, Sunbites grew 42% and Cheetos grew 9%. 
We have continued to generate strong net price realization even in a sluggish consumer environment through enhanced revenue management capabilities and data analytics. We've introduced new price-pack combinations tailored to much more targeted shopper and consumer locations. For example, in North America, over the past 5 years, we have shifted approximately 6% of our carbonated soft drink volume mix from traditional 2-liter and 12-ounce multipack packages to higher-margin, more profitable single-serve and alternative multi-serve packages. These efforts have been driving higher net price realization for us and our retail partners.
We have also been future-proofing our product portfolio, reshaping it to capitalize on consumers' increasing interest on health and wellness. Just to give you an idea. We track 2 sets of numbers: first, what we view as everyday nutrition, which includes products that provide positive nutrients like grains, fruit and vegetables and protein plus those products that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea. Now these products account for almost 25% of our portfolio by revenue. 
Second, what we view as guilt-free products. These include the everyday nutrition products plus diet beverages and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. Guilt-free products account for approximately 45% of our portfolio by revenue. 
The growth of our everyday nutrition products, which accounts for 1/4 of our global net revenue, is outpacing the growth of the balance of the portfolio, and we've had a significant amount of activity underway to transform our portfolio. Just to give you a few examples. We have broadened our beverage portfolio to lessen our reliance on colas, and today, we have the leading non-carbonated beverage portfolio in the United States. In fact, globally, just 12% of our revenues comes from trademark Pepsi and less than 25% comes from carbonated soft drinks on a global basis.
We have invested in R&D to create advantaged sweetness solutions and lower-calorie products, and we are aggressively moving our portfolio to package and product combinations with fewer calories. Mountain Dew Kickstart with just 40 calories per 8 ounces is a great example of our execution in this area. Now in its third year, Kickstart generated more than $300 million in estimated retail sales in 2015 and posted a 34% volume growth in the first quarter of 2016. 
We've also been shifting more of our beverage A&M to lower-calorie products in order to accelerate growth in strategically advantaged subcategories. And we have increased the nutritional profile of our snacks and foods through the introduction of products like Smartfood Delight, which grew volume over 75% in the first quarter; reduced-fat Doritos, the top-selling Frito-Lay snack banned in schools, which grew volume 30% in the first quarter; and gluten-free Quaker Oats, just to name a few. Net-net, we feel pretty good about our portfolio transformation efforts.
Next, we are building and investing in new capabilities to win in high-growth channels. To capitalize on increased out-of-home food and beverage consumption, we have consolidated our foodservice resources into 1 team, enabling us to creatively leverage the breadth of our product portfolio with our customers and consumers. In the United States, foodservice now represents approximately 14% of our total revenue and in the first quarter, outpaced the growth of the balance of other channels combined. This year, we will be increasing the out-of-home availability of our everyday nutrition products, both snacks and beverages, through the targeted placement of approximately 20,000 Hello Goodness vending machines across North America.
Our advertising and marketing has also become more impactful. First, we have stepped up our level of investment from 5.2% of sales in 2011 to 6.3% of sales in 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, our A&M expense increased by a further 65 basis points as a percentage of sales versus the prior year quarter. At the same time, we have increased the effectiveness of our A&M investment by shifting more dollars into consumer-facing working A&M and by more effectively integrating social and digital media in our marketing campaigns.
We have also accelerated our productivity programs, contributing to consistent core margin expansion and providing investment funding for growth initiatives. Since 2012, we have generated approximately $1 billion of annual productivity savings, and we are on pace to do so again this year. In addition, we have fully implemented our zero-based Smart Spending program across the enterprise.  Already seeing significant expense reductions in the areas targeted, and our organization is fully mobilized to identify opportunities to drive even greater levels of productivity.
And then we've stepped up our marketplace execution by working in creative new ways with our retail partners, like unique joint execution sports and entertainment properties, development of new and innovative merchandising and fountain equipment, execution of coordinated consumer promotions and leveraging the combined power of the PepsiCo product portfolio. So for example, with 7-Eleven, Doritos and Super Bowl all turning 50 this year, in the first quarter, we teamed up to offer consumers NFL experiences and prices, including a trip to Super Bowl 50. When consumers purchase a golden combo of any size, Doritos, Pepsi, Slurpee or grilled item, they could scan the 7-Eleven app to receive a code to unlock prizes from teamupforgold.com.  
And at Albertsons, we executed a joint promotion across PepsiCo's entire product portfolio in the All for Super Bowl Sweepstakes [ph]. There was a massive blitz of in-store displays, in-circular advertising and online promotions. When consumers purchase 2 or more participating products in 1 transaction, they qualify to enter to win $50,000, 1 of 50 nflshop.com gift cards every week during the promotion period. These examples are by no means exception to the rule. They're just a couple of demonstrations of how we are working creatively and collaboratively to deliver value to the consumer and be an indispensable growth partner for our retailers. 
The actions we have taken and the investments we've made to strengthen our capabilities, our innovation, revenue management, portfolio transformation, customer service initiatives, in particular, is what helped us deliver impressive operating results in the first quarter. We continue to achieve healthy net revenue realization, and new products continue to be an important contributor to our sales growth.
Next, in the context of an interesting macro backdrop, we feel good about the state of our business, and we are off to a good start in 2016. We believe we have the right plans in place. We have great people. We are executing well. We are investing in capabilities that will propel our future growth. We will continue to leverage our considerable advantages, our scale, geographic presence, product portfolio and Power of One synergies to succeed in this environment, and we are well positioned to achieve our 2016 financial targets. 
Many of our investors have commented to me that they value PepsiCo because of our sustained reliable performance. As stewards of this remarkable 50-plus-year-old enterprise, we are managing and investing the business to extend the duration of performance while achieving returns above our cost of capital, and we are committed to ensuring that our best years are ahead of us. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"
32854,328650933,959113,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first quarter, and having a good start to the year with 1 quarter behind us gives us added confidence in achieving the financial targets we",502,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first quarter, and having a good start to the year with 1 quarter behind us gives us added confidence in achieving the financial targets we shared with you in February. And so as you saw on this morning's release, we reaffirmed those targets. Specifically, we expect approximately 4% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, and we expect 8% core constant-currency EPS growth, excluding the impact of deconsolidating our Venezuela operations and 6% when including the Venezuela impact. 
Notwithstanding our strong Q1 results, the macro outlook remains highly volatile and uncertain, and for this reason, we are maintaining a cautious stance on the external factors that influence our business. So balancing a positive view of our execution against a more negative view of the macros, we arrived at the conclusion to keep our revenue and earnings guidance unchanged. 
We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both revenue and EPS by approximately 4 percentage points, which is also unchanged from the full year estimate we provided to you last quarter. As a reminder, we base our foreign exchange translation forecast on consensus rates. I know a number of you use spot rates, which currently lead you to a less significant impact. Clearly, as the year progresses, this gap will resolve itself, but we're holding to our outlook at a negative impact of 4% for the year for both revenue and EPS. As a result, we continue to expect 2016 core EPS of $4.66. Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set out in this morning's release. 
For the analysts on the call, as you update your models, I'd ask that you consider the following factors. We have a more difficult core constant-currency operating profit growth comparisons in the upcoming quarters at both Frito-Lay North America and North America Beverages. We anticipate a slower rate of gross margin expansion versus Q1 as we expect raw material inflation, which includes the impact of translate -- transaction-related foreign exchange for the balance of the year compared to modest deflation in Q1. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including a planned increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. 
While we expect lower corporate expenses for the full year, primarily driven by lower pension costs, there will be quarterly volatility in this line item due to timing, and you should not expect to see the rate of decline that we had in Q1 for the full year. The reinvestment of the 53rd week benefit will occur over the balance of the year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela earnings of approximately $0.03 per share in Q2 and $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect balance-of-year EPS growth to be disproportionately weighted toward the fourth quarter. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

Remember, the first quarter is not really the season for international because it's only 2 months, and so we're really entering the season now. And based on the innovation pipeline, based on the execution capability of our businesses and knowing what we've sold into customers around the world, both on retail and foodservice, at this point, we feel optimistic about our revenue guidance for the year. Again, this is based on everything that we can control and based on our assessment of the tough macroeconomic environment as we see it today. So I'd say as the year progresses, we'll know more, but we feel reasonably optimistic about our 4% earnings guidance for the year -- revenue -- sorry, revenue. I'm -- pardon me. Let me now turn to the North American pricing. Again, when we look at 1% pricing here, it's really rounded down. It was closer to 1.5%. And again, we're just now entering the season. So based on what we've seen in the marketplace, we actually see quite a lot of discipline in pricing, and our hope is that given the dynamics of the CSD category in particular, that there will be continued discipline based mostly on revenue management and careful mix management. And that's really what we are focused on, and our goal is to make sure that we don't do anything crazy on pricing because pricing actions don't really drive volume growth. So we are just making sure that we focus on mix management or revenue management to keep getting the positive price realization going through the year."

Number two, we do continue to invest in capabilities that enable globalization of best practices, and that's having a profoundly positive effect on both the innovation as well as the productivity of the company. What I suspect you may be seeing is the impacts of Smart Spending, which is off to a very successful start as of late last year and into this year. Certain of the big buckets that we're focused on in Smart Spending, whether it be travel or facilities, are actually down by meaningful percentages. So I think what you may be seeing is the net of that reflects a less margin invested in SG&A than you've perhaps seen in previous quarters. But I don't want you to think that we're not investing in the brands and we're not investing in capabilities to drive performance. We absolutely are."

A couple of years, you get volume growth, and then a couple of years, you get more revenue growth because you have more opportunity to do mix management. When we premiumize a portfolio, for example, we get more revenue than we do volume because you get very good price  realization on premium products. And right now, with the launch of lots of premium beverages and launch of premium products coming out of Frito-Lay, we're getting good price realization, and that's core. And clearly, when you do revenue management, even shifting to smaller packages, mini cans, you don't get much volume lift but you get revenue lift. And I think, as I look into the future, I think you're going to see some volume growth. You're going to see effective mix management, both from a revenue management perspective and the product portfolio itself, giving us robust revenue growth. A couple of years from now, let's come back and revisit it, but right now, that's the strategy going forward.

The population -- the demographics are pretty good, and when the country performs well, things are good. But recently, in the last, I'd say, 12 to 18 months, there's been a lot of self-induced problems in Brazil, and then the slowdown in China clearly has had an impact on Brazil because Brazil was the commodity supplier to the robust growth in China. And so it's going to take some time for Brazil to get through its issues, its own political problems and then, of course, the global commodity price slump right now. So we are cautious in our approach to Brazil, focused more on value products, and where we can get some premium pricing in, we try to get it in. But Brazil has been -- I think, globally, Brazil is one of the toughest economic situations today. And in the case of Russia, our core business is doing quite well because it's one of those markets where we have a spectacular portfolio, very balanced between all day parts. Between Good-for-You products, Fun-for-You, Better-for-You, it's a wonderful balance of products we have in Russia. And the Russian consumer is a good consumer, and we have a scale business covering all of Russia. I think 2 issues are impacting Russia. One is the ruble and where it stands. Because when you have dollar-denominated costs coming into Russia, clearly, it squeezes the middle of the P&L and you can't price enough to cover all of it because the Russian consumer -- which brings me to the second point. Russian consumer wages are not going up as much as the cost of living bucket suggests it should go up. So there's a bit of a squeeze going on. But all things considered, our team in Russia is mostly Russian, doing a very, very good job navigating through these issues in Russia. And I must say, but for these global macro conditions, especially the strength of the dollar squeezing the cost structure, we have a good business in Russia, and the team is doing a good job running it right now."

They are an amazing scale player, and they remain a valuable partner to PepsiCo. I think Tingyi has been impacted by a couple, 3 issues. And they're a public company. You've seen all their disclosures and announcements. I'm not going to share with you anything that you don't know. But basically, the slowdown in the Chinese market for beverages overall, driven by the macros. And some of the operational issues that Tingyi has had to cope with, because of the changes they were making to make their system more efficient, has taken a short-term hit in performance. And I think the readthrough has been that we, too, took a bit of a marginal hit in beverages in our performance, as we've talked about openly in our earnings calls. But having said that, within China, we have a very good business in foods and nutrition, and our beverage business, sequentially, is beginning to develop. So we remain cautiously optimistic. As far as our partnership with Tingyi is concerned, look, our ownership was based on a price that we recorded when we first did the transaction. Since that time, the overall Chinese market has come down a lot, a lot, and secondly, because of Tingyi's own performance, their stock has come down quite a bit. And so we felt it was prudent to mark down the value of our investment. Having said that, we remain very committed to the Tingyi partnership. And once they get through their issues, which they have to get through, we can help them, but they're a public company, we'll be back to a partnership that continues to sing."

I think it's safe to assume that we'll continue to get good solid pricing in those markets. I understand what you're pointing out is, as dollar-based commodities become less inflationary in local terms, will we continue to get the same level of commodity-driven pricing. Remains to be seen. Part of our pricing is obviously driven by commodities. Part of it is driven by what else is happening in the local economy. To the degree that pricing is less, I do expect that we'll see some volume bounce back because in those markets, when you have emerging consumers that are entering the categories, obviously, as we take less price, we tend to increase adoption more rapidly. So I think we probably will see a bit more volume and a bit less price in developing and emerging markets in the back half of the year, but that remains to be seen. The outlook, as we've talked about earlier, is not just -- not overly positive. It's also quite uncertain. Regarding mix versus rate, I assume that's a North America beverage question because that's a tough one to answer globally. About 2/3 of the pricing benefit that we saw in the first quarter was rate and about 1/3 was mix. So we continue to see good balance. In fact, if anything, we'd probably got a little bit more rate than we have been getting in the previous quarters."

So what we are -- what I'm going to give you is what we expect the year to come in at. And last year, we came very close to that 9% number. And typically, what we look for within that is sort of a 75% line extensions, what we call refresh innovation, because news drives growth in this category. Then 25%, we'd like it to be sort of reframe and breakthrough, which is new platforms or new -- substantially new packaging that can take the business to a whole new level. And again, across the world, this number varies, but roughly speaking, that's what we shoot for. And the things we are careful of is about -- Kickstart was a new platform, but after a couple of years, it becomes part of the base of the company and then we have to rely on flavor extensions to continue to drive it. And so something that's reframe or breakthrough the first year, after a couple or 3 years, it has to go back into the base and start getting countered and refreshed. So really how we count innovation is really stuff that's been launched and is in the markets for at least 2 years, and we look at the performance of that business on a rolling basis.

Let me talk about pricing. Ali, I can only talk about what we are going to do. Our belief is that it's very important that you really execute price rationally in the market because when you drop the price too much, it doesn't drive that much consumption growth, volume growth. I think we're at a point in the market in many of our categories where you can roll the business through premiumization, real innovation, but just playing a price game does not drive volume growth and it actually destroys value. So that's our strategy, and that's the playbook that we are going to execute. Let me turn to Tingyi. I think I gave you a pretty complete answer when Caroline asked the question, but let me just add to it. You've seen the Tingyi results. You've heard their call. You've heard all of the news that comes out of Tingyi. So I'm not going to talk about a public company that announced its results on its own. I'll just tell you that from my perspective or our perspective, clearly, the macro economics has played a role. I think Tingyi itself is trying to retool itself to become more efficient, and whenever you're going to do a transformation or retooling, there is going to be disruption to the business. And finally, the PepsiCo, Tingyi partnership started off very well, and I think it will come right back to where it was intended to be. The transition where we consolidate distribution systems, where we sought out products between PepsiCo-oriented distribution system or premium products-oriented distribution system versus a value-oriented products distribution system, that transition is taking a little bit longer and it's a little bit more painful. And I wish it could happen faster, but that's the reality of what we're living with because the slowdown in the macros has not helped either. So from a Tingyi perspective, as I said, we remain optimistic, and we just need to power through this and provide the help in terms of capabilities and knowledge transfer to them so they can get through the difficulties here. And I don't think Tingyi is indicative of any problems on a global basis. I'd tell you something. We have hundreds of partners globally in the beverage business. At any point, some percentage of those bottlers go through issues. That's the same for any company in this beverage business. And the strength of the franchise company is how do you help that bottling entity recover from its issues given that we operate COBOs and we have a reservoir of capabilities. And that's really what we are doing, taking people from our established COBOs, sending them into these bottler businesses to help them improve their performance. So I don't see any major red flags here, Ali."

So this is kind of a broader question for you, but I was hoping you could kind of briefly touch on what's the margin ambition at Frito. Can that be a 35% operating margin business over time? Quaker would seem like there's a significant opportunity there now without the Muller JV weighing on it. Can that return to a 30% operating margin business? And that would seem like that could happen over a much quicker period of time without that weighing it down. And then if you could briefly touch on NAB as well, which is a bit more difficult given the vertical integration there with bottler ownership.

It just gets into a level of granularity and detail it's probably more confusing than helpful. That said, I would broadly say all of our North American businesses have the potential to continue to see improved margins. How are they going to do that? Number one, it will be through our broad-based supply chain productivity programs. We continue to take cost out. Particularly moving from the plant to the store, we're getting more and more efficient at operating that distribution network. Number two, Smart Spending continues to present an opportunity to enhance margins, and again, that occurs across all of our businesses. And number three, as Indra pointed out earlier, we continue to see a lot of opportunities to premiumize our products. With those premium products come good price points. And once the products are in the marketplace and the A&M has normalized on those new products, you can expect to see those earning premium margins over time. So again, I don't want to get into specific division-level margin guidance, but I do believe that all of our North American businesses will continue to see margin improvement over time."

32854,328650933,959129,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jamie. I'm pleased report that 2016 is off to a good start with very strong operating results in the first quarter.

I'm pleased report that 2016 is off to a good start with very strong operating results in the first quarter. Global snacks organic volume increased by 1.5%, and global beverage organic volume increased 3%, the highest rate of quarterly beverage volume growth in 3 years. We delivered 3.5% organic revenue growth, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America and AMENA and 4% growth at Frito-Lay North America. Our 5 largest segments, Frito-Lay North America, North American Beverages, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA, each had both positive organic volume growth and positive net pricing. Core gross margins expanded by 130 basis points, and core operating margins expanded by 165 basis points, driven by the positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program. Core constant-currency operating profit grew 12%, and core constant-currency EPS grew 11%. 
It is noteworthy that we delivered these results in a volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment. Most of the developed world outside the United States is grappling with slow growth. GDP growth in developing and emerging markets is also challenged, with many D&E markets experiencing significant political unrest and high unemployment. Key energy-producing countries are dealing with significant budgetary gaps, and high levels of local inflation in many of these markets are rerouting disposable income and dampening consumer spending. It's a difficult environment indeed. 
Despite these macro challenges, we performed well. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue 7%, with double-digit growth in China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey. In the developed markets, we grew organic revenue by 2%, led by performance in the United States, where we grew revenue 2.5%. In fact, in the first quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth than the next 17 largest manufacturers combined. 
We have performed well because our approach to operating in this environment is and has been: to execute well against what we can control and to retool our business models and operating system to cope with what we believe could be sustained volatility and uncertainty. And this is really what we're doing. First, we have accelerated our innovation agenda, utilizing our proprietary demand spaces framework. This has led to our new products being more incremental and has contributed significantly to our overall organic revenue growth. 
We have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of new product launches by leveraging our global scale. We are more quickly and effectively lifting and adapting successful product launches from one market to another, driving more rapid expansion of our largest brands as well as our future billion-dollar brands. For example, in the first quarter, outside of North America, Lipton ready-to-drink tea grew 10%, Mountain Dew grew volume 9%, Gatorade grew 9%, Naked Juice grew 60%, Sunbites grew 42% and Cheetos grew 9%. 
We have continued to generate strong net price realization even in a sluggish consumer environment through enhanced revenue management capabilities and data analytics. We've introduced new price-pack combinations tailored to much more targeted shopper and consumer locations. For example, in North America, over the past 5 years, we have shifted approximately 6% of our carbonated soft drink volume mix from traditional 2-liter and 12-ounce multipack packages to higher-margin, more profitable single-serve and alternative multi-serve packages. These efforts have been driving higher net price realization for us and our retail partners.
We have also been future-proofing our product portfolio, reshaping it to capitalize on consumers' increasing interest on health and wellness. Just to give you an idea, we track 2 sets of numbers: first, what we view as everyday nutrition, which includes products that provide positive nutrients like grains, fruit and vegetables and protein plus those products that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea. Now these products account for almost 25% of our portfolio by revenue. Second, what we view as guilt-free products. These include the everyday nutrition products plus diet beverages and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. Guilt-free products account for approximately 45% of our portfolio by revenue. 
The growth of our everyday nutrition products, which accounts for 1/4 of our global net revenue, is outpacing the growth of the balance of the portfolio, and we've had a significant amount of activity underway to transform our portfolio. Just to give you a few examples. We have broadened our beverage portfolio to lessen our reliance on colas, and today, we have the leading non-carbonated beverage portfolio in the United States. In fact, globally, just 12% of our revenues comes from trademark Pepsi and less than 25% comes from carbonated soft drinks on a global basis.
We've invested in R&D to create advantaged sweetness solutions and lower-calorie products, and we are aggressively moving our portfolio to package and product combinations with fewer calories. Mountain Dew Kickstart with just 40 calories per 8 ounces is a great example of our execution in this area. Now in its third year, Kickstart generated more than $300 million in estimated retail sales in 2015 and posted a 34% volume growth in the first quarter of 2016. 
We've also been shifting more of our beverage A&M to lower-calorie products in order to accelerate growth in strategically advantaged subcategories. And we 've increased the nutritional profile of our snacks and foods through the introduction of products like Smartfood Delight, which grew volume over 75% in the first quarter; reduced-fat Doritos, the top-selling Frito-Lay snack banned in schools, which grew volume 30% in the first quarter; and gluten-free Quaker Oats, just to name a few. Net-net, we feel pretty good about our portfolio transformation efforts.
Next, we are building and investing in new capabilities to win in high-growth channels. To capitalize on increased out-of-home food and beverage consumption, we have consolidated our foodservice resources into 1 team, enabling us to creatively leverage the breadth of our product portfolio with our customers and consumers. In the United States, foodservice now represents approximately 14% of our total revenue and in the first quarter, outpaced the growth of the balance of other channels combined. This year, we will be increasing the out-of-home availability of our everyday nutrition products, both snacks and beverages, through the targeted placement of approximately 20,000 Hello Goodness vending machines across North America.
Our advertising and marketing has also become more impactful. First, we have stepped up our level of investment from 5.2% of sales in 2011 to 6.3% of sales in 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, our A&M expense increased by a further 65 basis points as a percentage of sales versus the prior year quarter. At the same time, we have increased the effectiveness of our A&M investment by shifting more dollars into consumer-facing working A&M and by more effectively integrating social and digital media in our marketing campaigns.
We have also accelerated our productivity programs, contributing to consistent core margin expansion and providing investment funding for growth initiatives. Since 2012, we have generated approximately $1 billion of annual productivity savings, and we are on pace to do so again this year. In addition, we have fully implemented our zero-based Smart Spending program across the enterprise.  Already seeing significant expense reductions in the areas targeted, and our organization is fully mobilized to identify opportunities to drive even greater levels of productivity.
And then we've stepped up our marketplace execution by working in creative new ways with our retail partners, like unique joint execution of sports and entertainment properties, development of new and innovative merchandising and fountain equipment, execution of coordinated consumer promotions and leveraging the combined power of the PepsiCo product portfolio. So for example, with 7-Eleven, Doritos and Super Bowl all turning 50 this year, in the first quarter, we teamed up to offer consumers NFL experiences and prices, including a trip to Super Bowl 50. When consumers purchase a golden combo of any size, Doritos, Pepsi, Slurpee or grilled item, they could scan the 7-Eleven app to receive a code to unlock prizes from teamupforgold.com.  
And at Albertsons, we executed a joint promotion across PepsiCo's entire product portfolio in the All for Super Bowl Sweepstakes [ph]. There was a massive blitz of in-store displays, in-circular advertising and online promotions. When consumers purchased 2 or more participating products in 1 transaction, they qualified to enter to win $50,000, 1 of 50 nflshop.com gift cards every week during the promotion period. These examples are by no means exception to the rule. They're just a couple of demonstrations of how we are working creatively and collaboratively to deliver value to the consumer and be an indispensable growth partner for our retailers. 
The actions we have taken and the investments we've made to strengthen our capabilities, our innovation, revenue management, portfolio transformation, customer service initiatives, in particular, is what helped us deliver impressive operating results in the first quarter. We continue to achieve healthy net revenue realization, and new products continue to be an important contributor to our sales growth.
Next, in the context of an interesting macro backdrop, we feel good about the state of our business, and we are off to a good start in 2016. We believe we have the right plans in place. We have great people. We are executing well. We are investing in capabilities that will propel our future growth. We will continue to leverage our considerable advantages, our scale, geographic presence, product portfolio and Power of One synergies to succeed in this environment, and we are well positioned to achieve our 2016 financial targets. 
Many of our investors have commented to me that they value PepsiCo because of our sustained reliable performance. As stewards of this remarkable 50-plus-year-old enterprise, we are managing and investing the business to extend the duration of performance while achieving returns above our cost of capital, and we are committed to ensuring that our best years are ahead of us. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"
32854,328650933,959129,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first quarter, and having a good start to the year with 1 quarter behind us gives us added confidence in achieving the financial targets we",500,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first quarter, and having a good start to the year with 1 quarter behind us gives us added confidence in achieving the financial targets we shared with you in February. And so as you saw on this morning's release, we reaffirmed those targets. Specifically, we expect approximately 4% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, and we expect 8% core constant-currency EPS growth, excluding the impact of deconsolidating our Venezuela operations and 6% when including the Venezuela impact. 
Notwithstanding our strong Q1 results, the macro outlook remains highly volatile and uncertain, and for this reason, we are maintaining a cautious stance on the external factors that influence our business. So balancing a positive view of our execution against a more negative view of the macros, we arrived at the conclusion to keep our revenue and earnings guidance unchanged. We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both revenue and EPS by approximately 4 percentage points, which is also unchanged from the full year estimate we provided to you last quarter. As a reminder, we base our foreign exchange translation forecast on consensus rates. I know a number of you use spot rates, which currently lead you to a less significant impact. Clearly, as the year progresses, this gap will resolve itself, but we're holding to our outlook at a negative impact of 4% for the year for both revenue and EPS. As a result, we continue to expect 2016 core EPS of $4.66. Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set out in this morning's release. 
For the analysts on the call, as you update your models, I'd ask that you consider the following factors. We have a more difficult core constant-currency operating profit growth comparisons in the upcoming quarters at both Frito-Lay North America and North America Beverages. We anticipate a slower rate of gross margin expansion versus Q1 as we expect raw material inflation, which includes the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange for the balance of the year compared to modest deflation in Q1. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including a planned increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. 
While we expect lower corporate expenses for the full year, primarily driven by lower pension costs, there will be quarterly volatility in this line item due to timing, and you should not expect to see the rate of decline that we had in Q1 for the full year. The reinvestment of the 53rd week benefit will occur over the balance of the year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela earnings of approximately $0.03 per share in Q2 and $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect balance-of-year EPS growth to be disproportionately weighted toward the fourth quarter. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

Remember, the first quarter is not really the season for international because it's only 2 months, and so we're really entering the season now. And based on the innovation pipeline, based on the execution capability of our businesses and knowing what we've sold into customers around the world, both on retail and foodservice, at this point, we feel optimistic about our revenue guidance for the year. Again, this is based on everything that we can control and based on our assessment of the tough macroeconomic environment as we see it today. So I'd say as the year progresses, we'll know more, but we feel reasonably optimistic about our 4% earnings guidance for the year -- revenue -- sorry, revenue. I'm -- pardon me. Let me now turn to the North American pricing. Again, when we look at 1% pricing here, it's really rounded down. It was closer to 1.5%. And again, we're just now entering the season. So based on what we've seen in the marketplace, we actually see quite a lot of discipline in pricing, and our hope is that given the dynamics of the CSD category in particular, that there will be continued discipline based mostly on revenue management and careful mix management. And that's really what we are focused on, and our goal is to make sure that we don't do anything crazy on pricing because pricing actions don't really drive volume growth. So we are just making sure that we focus on mix management and revenue management to keep getting the positive price realization going through the year."

A couple of years, you get volume growth, and then a couple of years, you get more revenue growth because you have more opportunity to do mix management. When we premiumize the portfolio, for example, we get more revenue than we do volume because you get very good price  realization on premium products. And right now, with the launch of lots of premium beverages and launch of premium products coming out of Frito-Lay, we're getting good price realization, and that's core. And clearly, when you do revenue management, even shifting to smaller packages, mini cans, you don't get much volume lift but you get revenue lift. And I think, as I look into the future, I think you're going to see some volume growth. You're going to see effective mix management, both from a revenue management perspective and the product portfolio itself, giving us robust revenue growth. Couple of years from now, let's come back and revisit it, but right now, that's the strategy going forward. And then we are very judicious in where we add capacity to make sure that we look at the realities of the volume growth in the marketplace."

The population -- the demographics are pretty good, and when the country performs well, things are good. But recently, in the last, I'd say, 12 to 18 months, there's been a lot of self-induced problems in Brazil, and then the slowdown in China clearly has had an impact on Brazil because Brazil was the commodity supplier to the robust growth in China. And so it's going to take some time for Brazil to get through its issues, its own political problems and then, of course, the global commodity price slump right now. So we are cautious in our approach to Brazil, focused more on value products, and where we can get some premium pricing in, we try to get it in. But Brazil has been -- I think, globally, Brazil is one of the toughest economic situations today. In the case of Russia, our core business is doing quite well because it's one of those markets where we have a spectacular portfolio, very balanced between all day parts. Between Good-for-You products, Fun-for-You, Better-for-You, it's a wonderful balance of products we have in Russia. And the Russian consumer is a good consumer, and we have a scale business covering all of Russia. I think 2 issues are impacting Russia. One is the ruble and where it stands. Because when you have dollar-denominated costs coming into Russia, clearly, it squeezes the middle of the P&L and you can't price enough to cover all of it because the Russian consumer -- which brings me to the second point. Russian consumer wages are not going up as much as the cost of living bucket suggests it should go up. So there's a bit of a squeeze going on. But all things considered, our team in Russia is mostly Russian, doing a very, very good job navigating through these issues in Russia. And I must say, but for these global macro conditions, especially the strength of the dollar squeezing the cost structure, we have a good business in Russia, and the team is doing a good job running it right now."

So let me start off by saying, Caroline, that Tingyi is still the leader in the beverage market in China, still has the most phenomenal infrastructure, widely covers China with all manufacturing technologies, cold fill, hot fill, aseptic, waterlines, you name it. They are an amazing scale player, and they remain a valuable partner to PepsiCo. I think Tingyi has been impacted by a couple, 3 issues. And they're a public company. You've seen all their disclosures and announcements. I'm not going to share with you anything that you don't know. But basically, the slowdown in the Chinese market for beverages overall, driven by the macros. And some of the operational issues that Tingyi has had to cope with, because of the changes they were making to make their system more efficient, has taken a short-term hit in performance. And I think the read through has been that we, too, took a bit of a marginal hit in beverages in our performance, as we've talked about openly in our earnings calls. But having said that, within China, we have a very good business in foods and nutrition, and our beverage business, sequentially, is beginning to develop. So we remain cautiously optimistic. As far as our partnership with Tingyi is concerned, look, our ownership was based on a price that we recorded when we first did the transaction. Since that time, the overall Chinese market has come down a lot, a lot, and secondly, because of Tingyi's own performance, their stock has come down quite a bit. And so we felt it was prudent to mark down the value of our investment. Having said that, we remain very committed to the Tingyi partnership. And once they get through their issues, which they have to get through, we can help them, but they're a public company, we'll be back to a partnership that continues to sing."

I think it's safe to assume that we'll continue to get good solid pricing in those markets. I understand what you're pointing out is, as dollar-based commodities become less inflationary in local terms, will we continue to get the same level of commodity-driven pricing. Remains to be seen. Part of our pricing is obviously driven by commodities. Part of it is driven by what else is happening in the local economy. To the degree that pricing is less, I do expect that we'll see some volume bounce back because in those markets, when you have emerging consumers that are entering the categories, obviously, as we take less price, we tend to increase adoption more rapidly. So I think we probably will see a bit more volume and a bit less price in developing and emerging markets in the back half of the year, but that remains to be seen. The outlook, as we've talked about earlier, is not just -- not overly positive. It's also quite uncertain. Regarding mix versus rate, I assume that's a North America beverage question because that's a tough one to answer globally. About 2/3 of the pricing benefit that we saw in the first quarter was rate and about 1/3 was mix. So we continue to see good balance. In fact, if anything, we probably got a little bit more rate than we have been getting in the previous quarters."

As I mentioned during the prepared remarks portion of the script, commodities were a little bit deflationary in Q1 because of the overlaps, particularly overlaps around energy prices.

Number two, there were certainly some timing of expenses, particularly as related to corporate expenses, as I mentioned, that gave us a big tailwind. Corporate expenses overall will be down in 2016, but they won't be down at the same rate that you saw in Q1. So for the balance of the year, it will spread itself out a bit more evenly. The net of all of that is I would expect less margin improvement in Q2 and Q3, and then you'll see stronger margin improvement again in Q4."

That's really what we targeted for ourselves this year, and we're running close to that number. Again, 1 quarter in innovation for the year does not make. So what we are -- what I'm going to give you is what we expect the year to come in at. And last year, we came very close to that 9% number. And typically, what we look for within that is sort of a 75% line extensions, and what we call refresh innovation, because news drives growth in this category. Then 25%, we'd like it to be sort of reframe and breakthrough, which is new platforms or new -- substantially new packaging that can take the business to a whole new level. And again, across the world, this number varies, but roughly speaking, that's what we shoot for. And the things we're careful of is about, Kickstart was a new platform, but after a couple of years, it becomes part of the base of the company and then we have to rely on flavor extensions to continue to drive it. And so something that's reframe or breakthrough the first year, after a couple or 3 years, it has to go back into the base and start getting countered and refreshed. So really how we count innovation is really stuff that's been launched and is in the markets for at least 2 years, and we look at the performance of that business on a rolling basis. So right now, we're running at about 9%. And it's 75%, 25%, refresh versus reframe and breakthrough."

How much of it was kind of macro, stock market, broad issues versus kind of the PepsiCo, Tingyi partnership, that 3P kind of third-party-type partnership and if that means anything differently in the way you guys view the way you want to distribute on a global basis with third parties?

Let me talk about pricing. Ali, I can only talk about what we are going to do. Our belief is that it's very important that you really execute price rationally in the market because when you drop the price too much, it doesn't drive that much consumption growth, volume growth. I think we're at a point in the market in many of our categories where you can roll the business through premiumization, real innovation, but just playing a price game does not drive volume growth and it actually destroys value. So that's our strategy, and that's the playbook that we are going to execute. Let me turn to Tingyi. I think I gave you a pretty complete answer when Caroline asked the question, but let me just add to it. You've seen the Tingyi results. You've heard their call. You've heard all of the news that comes out of Tingyi. So I'm not going to talk about a public company that announced its results on its own. I'll just tell you that from my perspective or our perspective, clearly, the macroeconomics has played a role. I think Tingyi itself is trying to retool itself to become more efficient, and whenever you're going to do a transformation retooling, there is going to be disruption in the business. And finally, the PepsiCo, Tingyi partnership started off very well, and I think it will come right back to where it was intended to be. The transition where we consolidate distribution systems, where we sought out products between PepsiCo-oriented distribution system or premium products-oriented distribution system versus a value-oriented products distribution system, that transition is taking a little bit longer and it's a little bit more painful. And I wish it could happen faster, but that's the reality of what we're living with because the slowdown in the macros has not helped either. So from a Tingyi perspective, as I said, we remain optimistic, and we just need to power through this and provide the help in terms of capabilities and knowledge transfer to them so they can get through the difficulties here. And I don't think Tingyi is indicative of any problems on a global basis. I'd tell you something. We have hundreds of partners globally in the beverage business. At any point, some percentage of those bottlers go through issues. That's the same for any company in this beverage business. And the strength of the franchise company is how do you help that bottling entity recover from its issues given that we operate COBOs and we have a reservoir of capabilities. And that's really what we are doing, taking people from our established COBOs, sending them into these bottler businesses to help them improve their performance. So I don't see any major red flags here, Ali."

While foreign exchange translations continue to pressure our re",3215,"Thanks, Jamie. I'm pleased to report that our businesses continued to perform well in the second quarter. We had more than 2% organic volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages. While foreign exchange translations continue to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 3% organic revenue growth led by Frito-Lay North America, AMENA and Latin America. ESSA delivered operating margin expansion together with increased A&M investment. 
North American Beverages delivered solid net price realization and margin expansion. And Quaker Foods North America had very strong net revenue and operating profit growth. And positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program, drove 80 basis points of core operating margin expansion. 
At the same time, we continue to invest in advertising and marketing, which increased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter, and our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue almost 7% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Mexico, Turkey and Egypt. 
In our developed markets, growth was led by the United States, where we grew revenue more than 2%. In fact, on a stand-alone basis, Frito-Lay was the largest contributor to growth at retail and gained value share in both salty and macro snacks. North American Beverages maintained its value share leadership and possesses 5 of the 10 top beverage trade box [ph] based on dollar sales: Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lipton and Starbucks. And Quaker gained almost 1.5 value share points in hot cereal while accounting for 100% of category retail sales growth. 
Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Organic revenue grew 3.4%. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% and up 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 8% but up 10%, excluding the Venezuela impact. 
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.71 from our previous target of $4.66, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
Specifically, there are 5 things we focus on to deliver in what continues to be a challenging macroenvironment: first, consumer-centric, relentless innovation; second, connecting with digital age consumers in new ways; third, being a true growth partner to our customers; fourth, flawless end-to-end execution; and fifth, a maniacal focus on productivity. 
Let me touch on each briefly. Product innovation and portfolio transformation are enabling us to provide consumers the delicious and convenient products they want and to satisfy their constantly evolving demands across a broad spectrum of occasions and need states. We have ramped up our innovation engine and, as a result, new products comprise approximately 9% of sales or over $5 billion. We've achieved this by leveraging our global scale while simultaneously tailoring products to appeal to local tastes, addressing consumers' evolving demands for convenience, taste and variety from the occasional treat to nutrition by transforming our product portfolio. 
So today, what we refer to as guilt-free products generates approximately 45% of our net revenue. And we are now recognizing consumers' interest in craft, niche and premium products. So for example, in beverages, Gatorade continues to innovate in new areas of sports hydration with the introduction of the G Frost flavor line up [ph], while Propel by the Makers of Gatorade drove more than 40% of the enhanced water category volume growth year-to-date. 
Following on the success of Mountain Dew Kickstart, we've introduced Mtn Dew Black Label, a deeper, darker dew made with real sugar and crafted with dark berry flavor and herbal bitters. Mtn Dew Black Label is for those times when DEW Nation wants to live it up with a touch of class. Dew Black Label is initially released exclusively at approximately 600 colleges and universities, giving students a first taste of the unique beverage, and demand for the product built as word quickly spread across social media. 
Along with the nationwide of release Mtn Dew Black Label, the brand is extending its boldly refined campaign. It started with activation during the SXSW music conference and festival in Austin, which included the Mtn Dew Black Label parlor, a SXSW takeover concert, and product seeding at local bars and venues. The campaign continued with the release of a new digital sport called gentlemen of the jacket. The content showcases different gentlemen skaters, including DEW athlete and pro skateboarder, including Theotis Beasley; mixologists and gamers, all crossing over to the classier side of DEW with the help of putting on a unique jacket, transforming worlds they are in to become a more refined version of itself, yet still getting at the heart of all things DEW. 
In the second quarter, we also launched Aquafina Sparkling, a new line of flavored sparkling water that provides a light and naturally sweetened hydration option. Aquafina Sparkling is offered in 3 delicious fruit flavors: Black Cherry Dragonfruit, Lemon Lime and Orange Grapefruit. Each sleek single-serve 12-ounce can contains just 10 calories and the tiniest pinch of Fair Trade Certified sugar for a smooth, crisp finish. Aquafina Sparkling will also be available in multipacks containing 2 flavors. 
We're also appealing to consumers' desire for discovery and more premium experiences. Naked Juice launched a line of cold-pressed juices branded Naked Pressed. It provides a new take on fresh taste, and the line comes in 5 varieties. It's sourced from cold-pressed whole fruits and vegetables and is Non-GMO Project Verified. 
And Pepsi has introduced 1893 from the Makers of Pepsi-Cola. It capitalizes on the cultural food revolution and is inspired by consumer interest in bold and interesting taste combinations. 1893 is packaged in sleek and premium 12-ounce cans and brings together premium ingredients and more than 100 years of cola-making expertise to present a great tasting, unexpectedly bold experience. 1893 is a blend of premium kola nut extract, real sugar and sparkling water available in 2 delicious flavors: Original and Ginger Cola. 1893 can be enjoyed as a delicious stand-alone beverage and is also the perfect complement for cocktails. 
In the Quaker business. Because consumers are increasingly seeking greater convenience, portability and nutrition in their breakfast, we've introduced Quaker Breakfast Flats, crispy baked snack bars that contains delicious ingredients that you can see, like oats, real pieces of fruit, crunchy nuts, flax and sunflower seeds. Each serving contains 18 grams of whole grains with less than 200 calories and no artificial flavors or added colors. Quaker Breakfast Flats comes in 3 delicious flavors, including Cranberry Almond, Banana Honey Nut and Golden Raisin Cinnamon. 
Turning to Frito-Lay. We continue to expand our portfolio with a particular focus on premium offerings and healthy snacking options. So for example, we've expanded our Simply line with the introduction of Simply Tostitos Black Bean Chips made from real black beans. It's Non-GMO Project Verified, and Simply Tostitos black bean chips offer consumers an excellent source of fiber with 5 grams per 1-ounce serving. And this Simply line has also introduced Simply Tostitos organic chunky medium salsa and Simply Tostitos organic black bean and corn mild salsa, and both salsa varieties are USDA certified organic. 
SunChips has introduced Veggie Harvest Farmhouse Ranch Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain; and Veggie Harvest Tomato, Basil & Cheese Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain, and both are made with real veggies and whole grains. And Smartfood has introduced Smartfood Delight Sea Salted Caramel Flavored Popcorn, which offers 50% less fat when compared to regular Smartfood White Cheddar Popcorn. It offers 100% whole grains and 35 calories per cup. 
So as a result of initiatives like this year-to-date, our Frito-Lay U.S. premium portfolio growth is outpacing the growth in the balance of the portfolio by a factor of more than 4x, and we're extending our value share leadership position in premium salty snacks. So that's innovation. 
The second capability I mentioned is connecting with consumers in the age of social and digital media and the purpose-driven consumer. So this summer, Gatorade is running For the Love of Sports, a national campaign that encourages athletes to think about and hold on to that moment when they were younger and first fell in love with sport. The multifaceted campaign features a national retail promotion, TV commercials and the unique cause initiative that encourages consumers to vote for deserving, sports-focused organizations to which Gatorade will donate on their behalf. 
The retail component includes limited time only bottles featuring athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Paul George and April Ross with a special callout of the For the Love of Sports cause initiative. Gatorade has partnered with a total of 19 sports-focused nonprofit organizations, 5 of which were selected by a roster of athletes featured on the limited time offer bottles. For the remaining 14 organizations, consumers will have the opportunity to vote for their favorite online to receive donations that will help athletes pursue their love of sport. 
We're also driving greater consumption of Quaker Oats in the warmer shoulder season by promoting the concept of overnight oats. We've collaborated with influential foodies to bring consumers quick and easy online tutorials on how to make delicious and nutritious jars of chilled overnight oats, perfect for days when you just need a simple, no-cook recipe. 
And earlier this year, we kicked off Quakers' very first Bring Your Best Bowl contest, a nationwide search for the next Quaker oatmeal flavor. The Bring Your Best Bowl contest highlights the endless ways to enjoy oatmeal, and invited fans across the country to submit their oatmeal creation using 2 to 5 ingredients along with their inspiration for a chance to win $250,000 and have their combination brought to life as Quakers' newest oatmeal flavor. Millions of consumers submitted creations using 2 to 5 ingredients along with the inspiration behind their idea. 
3 finalist flavors are now being developed by Quaker and will be revealed on around National Oatmeal Day, which is October 29. The selected flavors will then be made available in stores across the country for consumers to taste. Then it's up to America to vote online before the winning flavor is revealed in February of 2017. The grand prize winner will take home the cash price along with a chance to have his or her oatmeal combination debut on shelves nationwide. 
At the same time, Frito-Lay drove greater consumer engagement with the Lay's brand by asking Americans to help decide which Lay's flavor stays and which ones go. Lay's flavors swap campaign asked Americans to reach in the power of their palates and allow their voices and their taste buds to be heard. Consumers were invited to visit flavorswap.com to vote for their favorite flavor into the 4 flavor swap match ups. We received millions of customer votes, drove tremendous social media buzz and consumer engagement and strengthened Lay's brand in regard. 
To support trademark Pepsi this summer, we are taking the world's global language, emojis. We're taking it off-line in a visually striking and socially shareable campaign, inviting consumers to #SayItWithPepsi. From a smirk to a case to a wink, this initiative connects Cola lovers around the world through a common language that is uniquely and definably Pepsi. The PepsiCo design and innovation center created more than 600 PepsiMoji designs, all incorporating the essence of Pepsi, including the brand's iconic globe shape and the colors of blue, red and white. Both globally relevant and locally significant, PepsiMoji designs come to life across a full Pepsi portfolio and also beyond packaging and unexpected ways such as a fashion collaboration with designer Jeremy Scott, the limited-edition Pepsi with Jeremy Scott capsule collection includes 6 styles of emoji-inspired sunglasses featuring PepsiMoji designs. 
We have partnerships with famed photographer Ben Watts [ph] as well as Daniel Arnold [ph], a street photographer with one of today's most enviable Instagram followings. Their work shares a story of #PepsiMoji in the same nonverbal vein as emojis themselves with a quirky, candid and playful tone. 
We also have localized experiential content from vending machines in India that dispense Pepsi product adorned with PepsiMoji design that matches users' current state of mind to online engagement in Argentina, where consumers can create a personalized PepsiMoji design or use PepsiMoji accessories to fashion their selfies. And we also have a free PepsiMoji keyboard app that can be downloaded at the Apple app or Google Play stores. 
Global television and original digital creative also showcased how communicating through PepsiMoji icons can lead to unpredictable and memorable adventures and experiences. And consumers around the world have already begun to experience #PepsiMoji in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, Russia and Thailand. The global campaign is being featured in more than 100 markets around the world in 2016. 
We're also capitalizing on our partnership with the UEFA Champions League with global activation. Every year, the UEFA Champions League brings together the best teams across Europe to compete in the game's biggest Club competition. Fans of the tournament extend far and wide around the world. That's why in more than 100 markets around the globe, PepsiCo executed programs to realize the benefits of our official sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League. From Argentina to Zambia, we have football fans covered with exciting media campaign tailored to the local market. 
For example, in South Africa, Lay's and Pepsi launch the national #perfectmatch campaign, reinforcing Lay's and Pepsi as the snack and beverage combination of choice. In Mexico, we ran a Power of One campaign, promoting the concept Pepsi and Sabritas take you to the UEFA Champions League final. And in Chile, we leverage the UEFA Champions League final ship with unique packaging and promotions across our Gatorade, Pepsi and Lay's brand. And we delivered a phenomenal experience of the UEFA Champions League final opening ceremony presented by Pepsi, where Alicia Keys gave an incredible performance, ushering a new live entertainment era at the soccer final. 
The third capability is being a value growth partner with retailers, and we've done this by continuing to drive traffic and basket size through investing in and leveraging consumer and shopper insights, constantly finding new ways to become more efficient and coordinated with our retail partners supply chain and integrating our marketing initiatives with our retailer strategies, including tailored execution of sports, music and other properties. As a consequence, we tend to be among the top drivers of our customers' growth. 
In fact, in the United States, which is our largest market, in the second quarter, we were once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth at retail than all other $5 billion plus food and beverage manufacturers combined, more growth at retail than all other $5 billion plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. 
The next capability is dialing up end-to-end execution from seed to shelf, making sure our products are fresh and ubiquitously available. We're doing this by using advanced data and analytics to capture more precise demand signals stream from our supply chain and retooling our supply chain and go-to-market systems to improve service, eliminate stocks and reduce the cycle time from raw materials to product on the shelf. 
Our initiatives in this area now include expanding our successful GES program for Frito-Lay North America to our beverage businesses. 
And the fifth and final focus is fueling margin expansion and capability investments with productivity. Year-to-date, core gross margins expanded 100 basis points, and core operating margin expanded 115 basis points even as we continue to invest in A&M, which is up 55 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
In addition to marketing, we also continue to invest in critical capabilities like R&D, the establishment of our global design center and the creation of our global e-commerce growth. To capture productivity, we are increasingly leveraging automation and advanced technology as well as the developing a deployment of global best practices, all to make us supply chain more efficient. 
Let me just give you a few examples from the hundreds of supply chain productivity projects that are currently in flight. We're implementing automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, increasing packaging line speeds by up to 50% while, at the same time, eliminating the bottleneck to total production lines and significantly reducing labor costs. 
To improve our water use efficiency, we have developed and are implementing technology and processes that captures sugar and starch from wastewater streams. The waste sugars and starches are then sold as by-product. The resulting water stream can then be repurposed for secondary manufacturing uses such as sanitation. 
This does not only generate incremental cash flow and saves money, it also reduces our water usage to advance our sustainability agenda. Our global operations group is identifying and then lifting and shifting best practices developed by our manufacturing teams around the world. For example, our manufacturing team in Romania developed a refinement to our potato cutting process that can reduce raw potato waste by up to 2%. We're now implementing this process improvement in other plants around the globe. We're capturing significant savings by using advanced logistics planning, processes and tools, which enable us to optimize both the mode and routing of material transport. These tools, initially developed and deployed in North America, have been expanded to 9 more countries and are generating 3% to 4% savings in transportation costs. 
And in key markets, we've also advanced our third-party transportation procurement process by consolidating all transport origin destination fares across our food and beverage businesses to present to the market for competitive bids, and we have the opportunity to expand this process to more markets. Productivity is also being captured through the implementation of our Smart Spending program, which is driving meaningful reductions in key discretionary spending areas like travel, facilities and consulting. We are attacking spending on both rate and volume dimensions. 
So, for example, in travel, we've adopted much more stringent policies governing mode and class of travel, hotel rates and per diem meal limits, all of which have reduced the rate elements of the costs. But we've also mandated and encouraged working in ways to reduce the volume elements of costs. So, for example, we reduced meeting-related travel by insisting on the use of teleconferencing in place of physical meetings in many instances. 
And as a result of all of our productivity efforts, we are capturing significant savings that are delivering meaningful margin improvement and also providing the funding necessary to invest in the long-term health of the business. Taken together, our top line driving commercial activities and our robust productivity agenda are helping us deliver our financial targets despite continuing macro challenges. 
We are aggressively driving innovation, marketing, market-based execution productivity to deliver balanced and sustainable performance. We are confident we have the right plans in place and believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2016 targets, including our increased core constant currency EPS outlook, which we announced this morning. 
Just as important, we continue to invest in capabilities and to transform our portfolio to succeed in the dynamic customer and consumer landscapes with a singular goal of generating sustainable shareholder value for the long term. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first half, and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of the year, and so as you saw on this morning's release, we've raised our full year core EPS target to $4.71, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency growth of 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela; a negative 2 percentage point impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation; and a negative 4 percentage points impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus. 
Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set out in this mornings release. Our efforts to improve working capital continue to yield positive results. Over the past year, we have improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days. 
For analysts on the call, as you update your models, I ask that you consider the following factors: foreign exchange translation continues to be a headwind, more heavily skewed to Q3 than Q4. We have more difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the second half at Frito-Lay North America. North America beverages has particularly difficult revenue and operating profit laps in Q3. We expect low single-digit raw material inflation, including the impacts of foreign exchange translation in the second half compared to modest deflation in the first half. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including an expected increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela core earnings of approximately $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect the balance-of-year core EPS growth to be generated entirely in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, operator, we'll take the first question."

Look, then macro snacks category is a big category, and we're only playing in the salty-snack category, expanding into savory snacks, and our goal is if we go back maybe 15 years ago, and we've been consistent in the strategy we've always said grow the core and add more. In [indiscernible] we've used these words, and that's what Frito-Lay has been doing. Solidify our position in salty snacks and start to step out of the core into other savory snacks and then start to take on other occasions from the overall macro snacks category. So all the work we've done in demand spaces says that there is huge opportunity as the world starts to see more and more towards the liking for savory products. So savory is in, and we see amazing opportunities ahead for Frito-Lay to grow its business. Secondly, Frito has many mainstream competitor. We haven't played as much in the premium part of the portfolio. And now we've gotten our game together in the premium side, and we are seeing growth as I mentioned in the script, the premium part of the portfolio grew 4x faster, and we are just getting started. So we see tremendous opportunities for Frito-Lay to grow in the premium side peak. And I make one final comment, Bill, before I toss it to Hugh to talk about productivity. The great thing about Frito-Lay is we have great brands. We have great innovation capability, but we were an amazing pipeline to the customer and consumer. Our DSD system is a well-oiled machine, and we can keep expanding the diameter of the pipeline, and it's really our imagination in terms of what products we can innovate with to put through the pipeline. So with that, Hugh, let me turn it you to talk about the margins in Frito."
32854,346958840,1004940,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 07, 2016",2016-07-07,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Yes, happy to. A couple of comments on margins in the short answer is I think Frito-Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in it and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way. Why do I say that?

A couple of comments on margins in the short answer is I think Frito-Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in it and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way. Why do I say that? Number one, it's to build on the commentary that Indra just made. While we are the market leaders in premium, we are relatively underpenetrated compared to where we are in mainstream, and premium does offer a very, very attractive margins, particularly as you scale it over time. So I think there's a significant margin up with there. Number two, is in the area of GES that the initiative that we've been working on for a number of years, where we shorten the supply chain, deliver product to the customer and ultimately, to the consumer much more quickly by going essentially derived from plant to store before going from plant to cross back to store. The benefit of that is we obviously eliminate a lot of excess costs in the system. And as we take that excess cost out, we are reinvesting some back in premium, and we're delivering some to the bottom line. To use the baseball metaphor that you used earlier, we are really only in about the fourth or fifth inning on GES. GES has a number of years to run. And in fact, I think the GES impact on the financials are likely to be more profound in the future than they have in the past. And then the third element to this is this whole area of Smart Spending. Frito-Lay is absolutely taken a ball and run with Smart Spending as they always do, but we're really only right now exploiting 4 out of what could potentially be about 30 categories in Smart Spending. So I think Smart Spending also offers us years of runway to deliver additional productivity. So if you put all that together, premium, plus GES, plus Smart Spending and combine that with the fact that Frito-Lay strong market position gives it the ability to scale things in ways that none of its competitors can't, I think we have many years of margin improvement to come and frankly, significant margin improvement to come in Frito."

Dara, we spent a lot of effort, time, money on putting in an ERP system, and we invested in SAP, and we started that way back in 2000, and we've been doing that for the last 10 or 15 years. And putting in an ERP system takes time, takes money, and now we're beginning to see some of the benefits from that ERP implementation. And as we complete a lot of those implementations, we are able to take out the cost from those implementation and start to realize the benefits. So it's streamline the supply chain, the organization, Smart Spending and now the increased leverage from the SAP investments."

One is just trying to get a little bit of a better handle on your earnings guidance range today. I know at last quarter, a lot of people were kind of thinking about it going up, but this quarter, you raised it from 8% to 9%. The top line isn't any different. Productivity is roughly the same. Commodity looks the same. Taxes look unchanged versus last guidance. So if you're assuming an acceleration of about 2 points for the back half of the year, and I was just trying to get a better sense of what gives you that confidence that it's going to go up to 10% rates to it's clearly not macros. You knew the Q4 compares so trying to get a sense there. That's question one. Question  two, and Indra don't take this wrong way, take it very positively but there continues to be kind of a real thoughtful set of questions from important investors about your future at Pepsi versus, for example, any future presidential administration. And these are real questions people are really thinking about. So can you in any way give us some help in clarifying your future interests between business and politics. You've done such incredible job at Pepsi, people really kind of asking themselves this question. So anyway you can help clarify that debate that if whether you out there would be helpful."

Now that we are halfway through the year, I think we've seen 2 thing: one, the macros are operating in a consistent steady way. So there has not been a deterioration, which obviously is to our benefit relative to our expectations. And number two, we do see significant innovation launching the back half of the year that we're quite optimistic about. Some of the things you see more recently that Indra mentioned, whether it's Mtn Dew Black Label, Aquafina Sparkling, 1893, the Simply line at Tostitos down at Frito, we're quite which are doing terrifically well and in it coming out of Quaker as well. When you put together all of that innovation, it will have a disproportionate impact in the back half of the year, which is really our cause for optimism in the balance of year.

I'd like Hugh to talk about this because Hugh is my right hand and left hand when it comes to visit when capital allocation and so I'd like Hugh to talk about that. Let me talk about Diet Pepsi, Judy. You know what's interesting? If you go and poll consumers today and read all the social media reports, there's still trepidation about aspartame. There's no scientific reason for that, but people are somehow worried about aspartame. And when we launched Diet Pepsi aspartame-free, it's because there was a huge consumer need for that product. What we did not anticipate is that there's a group of consumers that absolutely loved the original Diet Pepsi. And in the cola category in particular because it's been optimized over years, people get incredibly fastidious about a products and don't want to have any changes. So rather than remove the aspartame free, which is still loved by a lot of people. In fact, I tell you when we announced that we were bring back the old Diet Pepsi, the few people that thought aspartame-free was going away wrote me some pretty tough e-mails, and so there is a very loyal group that is thrilled that we have an aspartame-free following. So we brought back the original Diet Pepsi in addition to keeping the aspartame-free products so we could serve all consumers with the products that they love. I think that's going to be net positive for us. Let me just say, the marketplace is fragmenting. Forget Pepsi or Diet Pepsi or the cola category. Any new category that expanding is becoming more niche, more fragmented, and that's why it is important for us to own the distribution system because once you have control over the distribution system, you can pump a lot of niche products through it, all our craft brands, all of those are low volume products. So we have to learn how to handle complexity, not walk away from it. So, Hugh, talk about capital allocation and..."

Let me just start with a bit of historical perspective on this because obviously, there's lots of activity in terms of people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a reminder, we have about a little over 1/4 of our portfolio in nutrition, and then if you add in the Better-for-You products, it's really -- it gets upwards to almost half of our portfolio in terms of the balance that we have right now. We are also from a developing and emerging markets perspective, about 1/3 exposed to developing and emerging markets. All of that is a result of transactions that we've executed really over the last decade or even more, whether it's Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana, Naked Juice, Wimm-Bill-Dann, Izzy, we've executed a variety of transactions over the last 10-plus years in order to get the portfolio into a place where it could consistently deliver performance. And frankly, that's what you've seen is this portfolio now regardless of economic cycle, regardless of consumer sentiment, regardless of consumer trends and shifts seems to be capable and has been capable of delivering good, strong performance throughout all of those shifts. As we look at things going forward, what we've said is we intend to expend something on the order of $500 million a year in tuck-in acquisitions. As those good opportunities emerge, we look at them, and we look at them through 2 lenses: one is a strategic lens around does it make sense where -- relative to where we think the consumer is going; and second is obviously a financial lens is this good for our shareholders. And you can count on us to continue to do that because we think that's the right way to think about M&A on a go-forward basis. I've also tell you that we look at everything. We've looked at everything that has transacted and probably every company that hasn't transacted. And if something transacts, and we're not a part of it, you can very reasonably assume it's because we didn't want to be. So the result of that is we feel like we're operating from a position of strength. We feel like we're in a position, right now, where we'll continue to look at things. We'll do things if they make sense, but the guidance that we've given right now is the guidance that makes sense, and that's the way we're thinking about it going forward. Some investors talk about the notion of sell when everyone's buying, and buy when everyone's selling. We tend to be good stewards of capital, and we watch -- we follow that maxim fairly closely."

We had more than 2% organic volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages. While foreign exchange translations continue to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 3% organic revenue growth led by Frito-Lay North America, AMENA and Latin America. ESSA delivered operating margin expansion together with increased A&M investment. 
North American Beverages delivered solid net price realization and margin expansion. And Quaker Foods North America had very strong net revenue and operating profit growth. And positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program, drove 80 basis points of core operating margin expansion. 
At the same time, we continue to invest in advertising and marketing, which increased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter, and our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue almost 7% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Mexico, Turkey and Egypt. 
In our developed markets, growth was led by the United States, where we grew revenue more than 2%. In fact, on a stand-alone basis, Frito-Lay was the largest contributor to growth at retail and gained value share in both salty and macro snacks. North American Beverages maintained its value share leadership and possesses 5 of the 10 top beverage trademarks based on dollar sales: Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lipton and Starbucks. And Quaker gained almost 1.5 value share points in hot cereal while accounting for 100% of category retail sales growth. 
Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Organic revenue grew 3.4%. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% and up 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 8% but up 10%, excluding the Venezuela impact. 
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.71 from our previous target of $4.66, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
Specifically, there are 5 things we focus on to deliver in what continues to be a challenging macroenvironment: first, consumer-centric, relentless innovation; second, connecting with digital age consumers in new ways; third, being a true growth partner to our customers; fourth, flawless end-to-end execution; and fifth, a maniacal focus on productivity. 
Let me touch on each briefly. Product innovation and portfolio transformation are enabling us to provide consumers the delicious and convenient products they want and to satisfy their constantly evolving demands across a broad spectrum of occasions and need states. We have ramped up our innovation engine and, as a result, new products comprise approximately 9% of sales or over $5 billion. We've achieved this by leveraging our global scale while simultaneously tailoring products to appeal to local tastes, addressing consumers' evolving demands for convenience, taste and variety from the occasional treat to nutrition by transforming our product portfolio. 
So today, what we refer to as guilt-free products generates approximately 45% of our net revenue. And we are now recognizing consumers' interest in craft, niche and premium products. So for example, in beverages, Gatorade continues to innovate in new areas of sports hydration with the introduction of the G Frost flavor lineup, while Propel by the Makers of Gatorade drove more than 40% of the enhanced water category volume growth year-to-date. 
Following on the success of Mountain Dew Kickstart, we've introduced Mtn Dew Black Label, a deeper, darker dew made with real sugar and crafted with dark berry flavor and herbal bitters. Mtn Dew Black Label is for those times when DEW Nation wants to live it up with a touch of class. Dew Black Label is initially released exclusively at approximately 600 colleges and universities, giving students a first taste of the unique beverage, and demand for the product built as word quickly spread across social media. 
Along with the nationwide of release Mtn Dew Black Label, the brand is extending its boldly refined campaign. It started with activation during the SXSW music conference and festival in Austin, which included the Mtn Dew Black Label parlor, a SXSW takeover concert, and product seeding at local bars and venues. The campaign continued with the release of a new digital sport called gentlemen of the jacket. The content showcases different gentlemen skaters, including DEW athlete and pro skateboarder, including Theotis Beasley; mixologists and gamers, all crossing over to the classier side of DEW with the help of putting on a unique jacket, transforming worlds they are in to become a more refined version of itself, yet still getting at the heart of all things DEW. 
In the second quarter, we also launched Aquafina Sparkling, a new line of flavored sparkling water that provides a light and naturally sweetened hydration option. Aquafina Sparkling is offered in 3 delicious fruit flavors: Black Cherry Dragonfruit, Lemon Lime and Orange Grapefruit. Each sleek single-serve 12-ounce can contains just 10 calories and the tiniest pinch of Fair Trade Certified sugar for a smooth, crisp finish. Aquafina Sparkling will also be available in multipacks containing 2 flavors. 
We're also appealing to consumers' desire for discovery and more premium experiences. Naked Juice launched a line of cold-pressed juices branded Naked Pressed. It provides a new take on fresh taste, and the line comes in 5 varieties. It's sourced from cold-pressed whole fruits and vegetables and is Non-GMO Project Verified. 
And Pepsi has introduced 1893 from the Makers of Pepsi-Cola. It capitalizes on the cultural food revolution and is inspired by consumer interest in bold and interesting taste combinations. 1893 is packaged in sleek and premium 12-ounce cans and brings together premium ingredients and more than 100 years of cola-making expertise to present a great tasting, unexpectedly bold experience. 1893 is a blend of premium kola nut extract, real sugar and sparkling water available in 2 delicious flavors: Original and Ginger Cola. 1893 can be enjoyed as a delicious stand-alone beverage and is also the perfect complement for cocktails. 
In the Quaker business. Because consumers are increasingly seeking greater convenience, portability and nutrition in their breakfast, we've introduced Quaker Breakfast Flats, crispy baked snack bars that contains delicious ingredients that you can see, like oats, real pieces of fruit, crunchy nuts, flax and sunflower seeds. Each serving contains 18 grams of whole grains with less than 200 calories and no artificial flavors or added colors. Quaker Breakfast Flats comes in 3 delicious flavors, including Cranberry Almond, Banana Honey Nut and Golden Raisin Cinnamon. 
Turning to Frito-Lay. We continue to expand our portfolio with a particular focus on premium offerings and healthy snacking options. So for example, we've expanded our Simply line with the introduction of Simply Tostitos Black Bean Chips made from real black beans. It's Non-GMO Project Verified, and Simply Tostitos black bean chips offer consumers an excellent source of fiber with 5 grams per 1-ounce serving. And this Simply line has also introduced Simply Tostitos organic chunky medium salsa and Simply Tostitos organic black bean and corn mild salsa, and both salsa varieties are USDA certified organic. 
SunChips has introduced Veggie Harvest Farmhouse Ranch Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain; and Veggie Harvest Tomato, Basil & Cheese Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain, and both are made with real veggies and whole grains. And Smartfood has introduced Smartfood Delight Sea Salted Caramel Flavored Popcorn, which offers 50% less fat when compared to regular Smartfood White Cheddar Popcorn. It offers 100% whole grains and 35 calories per cup. 
So as a result of initiatives like this year-to-date, our Frito-Lay U.S. premium portfolio growth is outpacing the growth in the balance of the portfolio by a factor of more than 4x, and we're extending our value share leadership position in premium salty-snacks. So that's innovation. 
The second capability I mentioned is connecting with consumers in the age of social and digital media and the purpose-driven consumer. So this summer, Gatorade is running For the Love of Sports, a national campaign that encourages athletes to think about and hold on to that moment when they were younger and first fell in love with sport. The multifaceted campaign features a national retail promotion, TV commercials and the unique cause initiative that encourages consumers to vote for deserving, sports-focused organizations to which Gatorade will donate on their behalf. 
The retail component includes limited time only bottles featuring athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Paul George and April Ross with a special callout of the For the Love of Sports cause initiative. Gatorade has partnered with a total of 19 sports-focused nonprofit organizations, 5 of which were selected by a roster of athletes featured on the limited time offer bottles. For the remaining 14 organizations, consumers will have the opportunity to vote for their favorite online to receive donations that will help athletes pursue their love of sport. 
We're also driving greater consumption of Quaker Oats in the warmer shoulder season by promoting the concept of overnight oats. We've collaborated with influential foodies to bring consumers quick and easy online tutorials on how to make delicious and nutritious jars of chilled overnight oats, perfect for days when you just need a simple, no-cook recipe. 
And earlier this year, we kicked off Quakers' very first Bring Your Best Bowl contest, a nationwide search for the next Quaker oatmeal flavor. The Bring Your Best Bowl contest highlights the endless ways to enjoy oatmeal, and invited fans across the country to submit their oatmeal creation using 2 to 5 ingredients along with their inspiration for a chance to win $250,000 and have their combination brought to life as Quakers' newest oatmeal flavor. Millions of consumers submitted creations using 2 to 5 ingredients along with the inspiration behind their idea. 
3 finalist flavors are now being developed by Quaker and will be revealed on around National Oatmeal Day, which is October 29. The selected flavors will then be made available in stores across the country for consumers to taste. Then it's up to America to vote online before the winning flavor is revealed in February of 2017. The grand prize winner will take home the cash price along with a chance to have his or her oatmeal combination debut on shelves nationwide. 
At the same time, Frito-Lay drove greater consumer engagement with the Lay's brand by asking Americans to help decide which Lay's flavor stays and which ones go. Lay's Flavor Swap campaign asked Americans to unleash the power of their palates and allow their voices and their taste buds to be heard. Consumers were invited to visit FlavorSwap.com to vote for their favorite flavor in each of the 4 Flavor Swap match-ups. We received millions of customer votes, drove tremendous social media buzz and consumer engagement and strengthened Lay's brand awareness and regard. 
To support trademark Pepsi this summer, we are taking the world's global language, emojis. We're taking it off-line in a visually striking and socially shareable campaign, inviting consumers to #SayItWithPepsi. From a smirk to a kiss to a wink, this initiative connects cola lovers around the world through a common language that is uniquely and definably Pepsi. The PepsiCo design and innovation center created more than 600 PepsiMoji designs, all incorporating the essence of Pepsi, including the brand's iconic globe shape and the colors of blue, red and white. Both globally relevant and locally significant, PepsiMoji's designs come to life across a full Pepsi portfolio and also beyond packaging in unexpected ways, such as a fashion collaboration with designer Jeremy Scott, the limited-edition Pepsi with Jeremy Scott Capsule Collection includes 6 styles of emoji-inspired sunglasses featuring PepsiMoji designs. 
We have partnerships with famed photographer Ben Watts as well as Daniel Arnold, a street photographer with one of today's most enviable Instagram followings. Their work shares a story of #PepsiMoji in the same nonverbal vein as emojis themselves with a quirky, candid and playful tone. 
We also have localized experiential content from vending machines in India that dispense Pepsi product adorned with a PepsiMoji design that matches users' current state of mind to online engagement in Argentina, where consumers can create a personalized PepsiMoji design or use PepsiMoji accessories to fashion their selfies. And we also have a free PepsiMoji keyboard app that can be downloaded at the Apple App or Google Play stores. 
Global television and original digital creative also showcased how communicating through PepsiMoji icons can lead to unpredictable and memorable adventures and experiences. And consumers around the world have already begun to experience #PepsiMoji in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, Russia and Thailand. The global campaign is being featured in more than 100 markets around the world in 2016. 
We're also capitalizing on our partnership with the UEFA Champions League with global activation. Every year, the UEFA Champions League brings together the best teams across Europe to compete in the game's biggest club competition. Fans of the tournament extend far and wide around the world. That's why in more than 100 markets around the globe, PepsiCo executed programs to realize the benefits of our official sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League. From Argentina to Zambia, we have football fans covered with exciting media [indiscernible] campaigns tailored to the local market. 
For example, in South Africa, Lay's and Pepsi launched the national #PerfectMatch campaign, reinforcing Lay's and Pepsi as the snack and beverage combination of choice. In Mexico, we ran a Power of One campaign, promoting the concept Pepsi and Sabritas take you to the UEFA Champions League final. And in Chile, we leverage the UEFA Champions League final ship with unique packaging and promotions across our Gatorade, Pepsi and Lay's brands. And we delivered a phenomenal experience of the UEFA Champions League final opening ceremony presented by Pepsi, where Alicia Keys gave an incredible performance, ushering a new live entertainment era at the soccer final. 
The third capability is being a value growth partner with retailers, and we've done this by continuing to drive traffic and basket size through investing in and leveraging consumer and shopper insights, constantly finding new ways to become more efficient and coordinated with our retail partner supply chain and integrating our marketing initiatives with our retailer strategies, including tailored execution of sports, music and other properties. As a consequence, we tend to be among the top drivers of our customers' growth. 
In fact, in the United States, which is our largest market, in the second quarter, we were once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined, more growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. 
The next capability is dialing up end-to-end execution from seed to shelf, making sure our products are fresh and ubiquitously available. We're doing this by using advanced data and analytics to capture more precise demand signal streams from our supply chain and retooling our supply chain and go-to-market systems to improve service, eliminate out-of-stocks and reduce the cycle time from raw material to product on the shelf. 
Our initiatives in this area now include expanding our successful GES program for Frito-Lay North America to our beverage businesses. 
And the fifth and final focus is fueling margin expansion and capability investments with productivity. Year-to-date, core gross margins expanded 100 basis points, and core operating margin expanded 115 basis points even as we continue to invest in A&M, which is up 55 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
In addition to marketing, we also continue to invest in critical capabilities like R&D, the establishment of our global design center and the creation of our global e-commerce growth. To capture productivity, we are increasingly leveraging automation and advanced technology as well as the development and deployment of global best practices, all to make our supply chain more efficient. 
Let me just give you a few examples from the hundreds of supply chain productivity projects that are currently in flight. We're implementing automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, increasing packaging line speeds by up to 50% while, at the same time, eliminating the bottleneck to total production lines and significantly reducing labor costs. 
To improve our water use efficiency, we have developed and are implementing technology and processes that captures sugar and starch from wastewater streams. The waste sugars and starches are then sold as by-product. The resulting water stream can then be repurposed for secondary manufacturing uses, such as sanitation. 
This not only generate incremental cash flow and saves money, it also reduces our water usage to advance our sustainability agenda. Our Global Operations Group is identifying and then lifting and shifting best practices developed by our manufacturing teams around the world. For example, our manufacturing team in Romania developed a refinement to our potato-cutting process that can reduce raw potato waste by up to 2%. We're now implementing this process improvement in other plants around the globe. We're capturing significant savings by using advanced logistics planning, processes and tools, which enable us to optimize both the mode and routing of material transport. These tools, initially developed and deployed in North America, have been expanded to 9 more countries and are generating 3% to 4% savings in transportation costs. 
And in key markets, we've also advanced our third-party transportation procurement process by consolidating all transport origin-destination pairs across our food and beverage businesses to present to the market for competitive bids, and we have the opportunity to expand this process to many more markets. Productivity is also being captured through the implementation of our Smart Spending program, which is driving meaningful reductions in key discretionary spending areas like travel, facilities and consulting. We are attacking spending on both rate and volume dimensions. 
So for example, in travel, we've adopted much more stringent policies governing mode and class of travel, hotel rate and per diem meal limits, all of which have reduced the rate element of the costs. But we've also mandated and encouraged working in ways to reduce the volume element of costs. So for example, we've reduced meeting-related travel by insisting on the use of teleconferencing in place of physical meetings in many instances. 
And as a result of all of our productivity efforts, we're capturing significant savings that are delivering meaningful margin improvement and also providing the funding necessary to invest in the long-term health of the business. Taken together, our top line-driving commercial activities and our robust productivity agenda are helping us deliver our financial targets despite continuing macro challenges. 
We are aggressively driving innovation, marketing, marketplace execution productivity to deliver balanced and sustainable performance. We are confident we have the right plans in place and believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2016 targets, including our increased core constant currency EPS outlook, which we announced this morning. 
Just as important, we continue to invest in capabilities and to transform our portfolio to succeed in the dynamic customer and consumer landscapes with a singular goal of generating sustainable shareholder value for the long term. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"
32854,346958840,1004972,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 07, 2016",2016-07-07,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first half, and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of the year. And so as you saw on this morning's release, we'",308,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first half, and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of the year. And so as you saw on this morning's release, we've raised our full year core EPS target to $4.71, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency growth of 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela; a negative 2 percentage point impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation; and a negative 4 percentage point impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus. 
Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged, and are set out in this morning's release. Our efforts to improve working capital continue to yield positive results. Over the past year, we have improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days. 
For analysts on the call, as you update your models, I ask that you consider the following factors. Foreign exchange translation continues to be a headwind, more heavily skewed to Q3 than Q4. We have more difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the second half at Frito-Lay North America. North America Beverages has particularly difficult revenue and operating profit laps in Q3. We expect low single-digit raw material inflation, including the impacts of foreign exchange translation in the second half compared to modest deflation in the first half. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including an expected increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela core earnings of approximately $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect the balance-of-year core EPS growth to be generated entirely in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, operator, we'll take the first question."

Look, the macro snack category is a big category, and we're only playing in the salty-snack category, expanding into savory snacks. And our goal -- and if you go back maybe 15 years ago, and we've been consistent in this strategy, we've always said grow the core and add more. In [indiscernible] we've used these words, and that's what Frito-Lay has been doing, solidify our position in salty-snacks and start to step out of the core into other savory snacks and then start to take on other occasions from the overall macro snack category. So all the work we've done in demand spaces says that there is huge opportunity as the world starts to swing more and more towards the liking for savory products. So savory is in, and we see amazing opportunities ahead for Frito-Lay to grow its business. Secondly, Frito-Lay has been a mainstream competitor. We haven't played as much in the premium part of the portfolio. And now we've gotten our game together in the premium side, and we are seeing growth and, as I mentioned in the script, the premium part of the portfolio grew 4x faster. And we are just getting started. So we see tremendous opportunities for Frito-Lay to grow in the premium side. And I'll make one final comment, Bill, before I toss it to Hugh to talk about productivity. The great thing about Frito-Lay is that we've got a great brand. We've got a great innovation capability, but we've brought an amazing pipeline to the customer and consumer. Our DSD system is a well-oiled machine, and we can keep expanding the diameter of that pipeline. And it's really our imagination in terms of what products we can innovate with to put through that pipeline. So with that, Hugh, let me turn it you to talk about the margins at Frito."
32854,346958840,1004972,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 07, 2016",2016-07-07,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Yes, happy to.

A couple of comments on margins, and the short answer is I think Frito-Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in it, and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way. Why do I say that? Number one, it's to build on the commentary that Indra just made. While we are the market leaders in premium, we are relatively underpenetrated compared to where we are in mainstream, and premium does offer very, very attractive margins, particularly as you scale it over time. So I think there's a significant margin uplift there. Number two is in the area of GES, the initiative that we've been working on for a number of years, where we shorten the supply chain, deliver product to the customer and, ultimately, to the consumer much more quickly by going essentially direct from plant to store before going from plant to cross-dock to store. The benefit of that is we obviously eliminate a lot of excess cost in the system. And as we take that excess cost out, we are reinvesting some back in premium, and we're delivering some to the bottom line. To use the baseball metaphor that you used earlier, we're really only in about the fourth or fifth inning on GES. GES has a number of years to run. And in fact, I think the GES impact on the financials are likely to be more profound in the future than they have in the past. And then the third element to this is this whole area of Smart Spending. Frito-Lay has absolutely taken the ball and run with Smart Spending as they always do, but we're really only right now exploiting 4 out of what could potentially be about 30 categories in Smart Spending. So I think Smart Spending also offers us years of runway to deliver additional productivity. So if you put all of that together, premium, plus GES, plus Smart Spending and combine that with the fact that Frito-Lay's strong market position gives it the ability to scale things in ways that none of its competitors can, I think we have many years of margin improvement to come and, frankly, significant margin improvement to come at Frito."

There's also a significant piece of it in the selling systems, which fall into SG&A. That's primarily the DSD system. We've got lots of room to be more efficient on that. We're really very much in the early innings on that. Number two, we do continue to streamline the organization. And number three, Smart Spending is having a significant impact on our SG&A spending.

Some of the things you've seen more recently that Indra mentioned, whether it's Mtn Dew Black Label, Aquafina Sparkling, 1893, the Simply line at Tostitos down at Frito or Quaker Breakfast Flats, which are doing terrifically well and in it coming out of Quakers, well, when you put together all of that innovation, it will have a disproportionate impact in the back half of the year, which is really our cause for optimism in the balance of year.

I believe for the half, it's flat or maybe even down a bit, just by the omission of the reference to being up for the first half. So question one is do you intend for it to be up for the full year? And then question two is, if you take these 2 large markets of Brazil and Mexico, could you give us a bit of an update on your outlook for each of those 2 regions because, of course, the conditions and your performance there, are quite diverse, I'm just looking for how you're looking at your future performance in those 2 markets."

And then completely unrelated, so you're bringing back Diet Pepsi with aspartame, so just wanted to get your perspective on kind of lessons learned and then as you think about your Diet portfolio, the risk of maybe fragmenting the portfolio even further with different kind of offerings and how you manage that."

Let me talk about Diet Pepsi, Judy. You know what's interesting? If you go and poll consumers today and read all the social media reports, there's still trepidation about aspartame. There's no scientific reason for that, but people are somehow worried about aspartame. And when we launched Diet Pepsi aspartame-free, it's because there was a huge consumer need for that product. What we did not anticipate is that there's a group of consumers that absolutely loved the original Diet Pepsi. And in the cola category, in particular, because it's been optimized over years, people get incredibly fastidious about new products and don't want to have any changes. So rather than remove the aspartame free, which is still loved by a lot of people -- in fact, I tell you when we announced that we were bringing back the old Diet Pepsi, a few people who thought aspartame-free was going away wrote me some pretty tough e-mails. And so there is a very loyal group that is thrilled that we have an aspartame-free following. So we brought back the original Diet Pepsi in addition to keeping the aspartame-free products so we could serve all consumers with the products that they love. I think that's going to be net positive for us. Now let me just say, the marketplace is fragmenting. Forget Pepsi or Diet Pepsi or the cola category. Any new category that is expanding is becoming more niche, more fragmented, and that's why it was important for us to own the distribution system because once you have control over the distribution system, you can pump a lot of niche products through it. All our craft products, all of those are low-volume products. So we have to learn how to handle complexity, not walk away from it. So Hugh, talk about capital allocation then portfolio..."

And I'll -- let me just start with a bit of historical perspective on this because, obviously, there's lots of activity in terms of people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a reminder, we have about a little over 1/4 of our portfolio in nutrition, and then if you add in the Better-for-You products, it's really -- it gets upwards to almost half of our portfolio in terms of the balance that we have right now. We're also, from a developing and emerging markets perspective, about 1/3 exposed to developing and emerging markets. All of that is a result of transactions that we've executed really over the last decade or even more, whether it's Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana, Naked Juice, Wimm-Bill-Dann, IZZE, we've executed a variety of transactions over the last 10-plus years in order to get the portfolio into a place where it could consistently deliver performance. And frankly, that's what you've seen is this portfolio now, regardless of economic cycle, regardless of consumer sentiment, regardless of consumer trends and shifts, seems to be capable and has been capable of delivering good, strong performance throughout all of those shifts. As we look at things going forward, what we've said is we intend to expend something on the order of $500 million a year in tuck-in acquisitions. As those good opportunities emerge, we look at them, and we look at them through 2 lenses: one is a strategic lens around, does it make sense where -- relative to where we think the consumer is going?; and second is obviously a financial lens, is this good for our shareholders? And you can count on us to continue to do that because we think that's the right way to think about M&A on a go-forward basis. I will also tell you that we look at everything. We've looked at everything that has transacted and probably every company that hasn't transacted. And if something transacts, and we're not a part of it, you can very reasonably assume it's because we didn't want to be. So the result of that is we feel like we're operating from a position of strength. We feel like we're in a position, right now, where we'll continue to look at things. We'll do things if they make sense, but the guidance that we've given right now is the guidance that makes sense, and that's the way we're thinking about it going forward. Some investors talk about the notion of sell when everyone's buying and buy when everyone's selling. We tend to be good stewards of capital, and we watch -- we follow that maxim fairly closely."

It's been LRB for the last decade or so, and I think the sooner we can shift our frame of reference, the better it is because just beating a category that is in secular decline, just beating that all the time is not a game to play. That's not a game that is going to guarantee good results. If we play this rich LRB game, multicategory, placing the bets where the growth is and where the consumer is going, I think we're better off. So my request to you and to all of you who are tracking the company in this category, expand your aperture. LRB is the game to play. That's the game we're playing, and we watch LRB share very, very carefully. That's the right strategy for any company."

We had more than 2% organic volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages. While foreign exchange translations continue to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 3% organic revenue growth led by Frito-Lay North America, AMENA and Latin America. ESSA delivered operating margin expansion together with increased A&M investment. 
North American Beverages delivered solid net price realization and margin expansion. And Quaker Foods North America had very strong net revenue and operating profit growth. And positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program, drove 80 basis points of core operating margin expansion. 
At the same time, we continue to invest in advertising and marketing, which increased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter, and our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue almost 7% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Mexico, Turkey and Egypt. 
In our developed markets, growth was led by the United States, where we grew revenue more than 2%. In fact, on a stand-alone basis, Frito-Lay was the largest contributor to growth at retail and gained value share in both salty and macro snacks. North American Beverages maintained its value share leadership and possesses 5 of the 10 top beverage trademarks based on dollar sales: Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lipton and Starbucks. And Quaker gained almost 1.5 value share points in hot cereal while accounting for 100% of category retail sales growth. 
Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Organic revenue grew 3.4%. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% and up 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 8% but up 10%, excluding the Venezuela impact. 
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.71 from our previous target of $4.66, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
Specifically, there are 5 things we focus on to deliver in what continues to be a challenging macroenvironment: first, consumer-centric, relentless innovation; second, connecting with digital age consumers in new ways; third, being a true growth partner to our customers; fourth, flawless end-to-end execution; and fifth, a maniacal focus on productivity. 
Let me touch on each briefly. Product innovation and portfolio transformation are enabling us to provide consumers the delicious and convenient products they want and to satisfy their constantly evolving demands across a broad spectrum of occasions and need states. We have ramped up our innovation engine and, as a result, new products comprise approximately 9% of sales or over $5 billion. We've achieved this by leveraging our global scale while simultaneously tailoring products to appeal to local tastes, addressing consumers' evolving demands for convenience, taste and variety from the occasional treat to nutrition by transforming our product portfolio. 
So today, what we refer to as guilt-free products generates approximately 45% of our net revenue. And we are now recognizing consumers' interest in craft, niche and premium products. So for example, in beverages, Gatorade continues to innovate in new areas of sports hydration with the introduction of the G Frost flavor lineup, while Propel by the Makers of Gatorade drove more than 40% of the enhanced water category volume growth year-to-date. 
Following on the success of Mountain Dew Kickstart, we've introduced Mtn Dew Black Label, a deeper, darker dew made with real sugar and crafted with dark berry flavor and herbal bitters. Mtn Dew Black Label is for those times when DEW Nation wants to live it up with a touch of class. Dew Black Label is initially released exclusively at approximately 600 colleges and universities, giving students a first taste of the unique beverage, and demand for the product built as word quickly spread across social media. 
Along with the nationwide of release Mtn Dew Black Label, the brand is extending its boldly refined campaign. It started with activation during the SXSW music conference and festival in Austin, which included the Mtn Dew Black Label parlor, a SXSW takeover concert, and product seeding at local bars and venues. The campaign continued with the release of a new digital sport called gentlemen of the jacket. The content showcases different gentlemen skaters, including DEW athlete and pro skateboarder, Theotis Beasley; mixologists and gamers, all crossing over to the classier side of DEW with the help of putting on a unique jacket, transforming worlds they are in to become a more refined version of itself, yet still getting at the heart of all things DEW. 
In the second quarter, we also launched Aquafina Sparkling, a new line of flavored sparkling water that provides a light and naturally sweetened hydration option. Aquafina Sparkling is offered in 3 delicious fruit flavors: Black Cherry Dragonfruit, Lemon Lime and Orange Grapefruit. Each sleek single-serve 12-ounce can contains just 10 calories and the tiniest pinch of Fair Trade Certified sugar for a smooth, crisp finish. Aquafina Sparkling will also be available in multipacks containing 2 flavors. 
We're also appealing to consumers' desire for discovery and more premium experiences. Naked Juice launched a line of cold-pressed juices branded Naked Pressed. It provides a new take on fresh taste, and the line comes in 5 varieties. It's sourced from cold-pressed whole fruits and vegetables and is Non-GMO Project Verified. 
And Pepsi has introduced 1893 from the Makers of Pepsi-Cola. It capitalizes on the cultural food revolution and is inspired by consumer interest in bold and interesting taste combinations. 1893 is packaged in sleek and premium 12-ounce cans and brings together premium ingredients and more than 100 years of cola-making expertise to present a great tasting, unexpectedly bold experience. 1893 is a blend of premium kola nut extract, real sugar and sparkling water available in 2 delicious flavors: Original and Ginger Cola. 1893 can be enjoyed as a delicious stand-alone beverage and is also the perfect complement for cocktails. 
In the Quaker business. Because consumers are increasingly seeking greater convenience, portability and nutrition in their breakfast, we've introduced Quaker Breakfast Flats, crispy baked snack bars that contains delicious ingredients that you can see, like oats, real pieces of fruit, crunchy nuts, flax and sunflower seeds. Each serving contains 18 grams of whole grains with less than 200 calories and no artificial flavors or added colors. Quaker Breakfast Flats comes in 3 delicious flavors, including Cranberry Almond, Banana Honey Nut and Golden Raisin Cinnamon. 
Turning to Frito-Lay. We continue to expand our portfolio with a particular focus on premium offerings and healthy snacking options. So for example, we've expanded our Simply line with the introduction of Simply Tostitos black bean chips made from real black beans. It's Non-GMO Project Verified, and Simply Tostitos black bean chips offer consumers an excellent source of fiber with 5 grams per 1-ounce serving. And this Simply line has also introduced Simply Tostitos organic chunky medium salsa and Simply Tostitos organic black bean and corn mild salsa, and both salsa varieties are USDA certified organic. 
SunChips has introduced Veggie Harvest Farmhouse Ranch Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain; and Veggie Harvest Tomato, Basil & Cheese Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain, and both are made with real veggies and whole grains. And Smartfood has introduced Smartfood Delight Sea Salted Caramel Flavored Popcorn, which offers 50% less fat when compared to regular Smartfood White Cheddar Popcorn. It offers 100% whole grains and 35 calories per cup. 
So as a result of initiatives like this year-to-date, our Frito-Lay U.S. premium portfolio growth is outpacing the growth in the balance of the portfolio by a factor of more than 4x, and we're extending our value share leadership position in premium salty-snacks. So that's innovation. 
The second capability I mentioned is connecting with consumers in the age of social and digital media and the purpose-driven consumer. So this summer, Gatorade is running For the Love of Sports, a national campaign that encourages athletes to think about and hold on to that moment when they were younger and first fell in love with sport. The multifaceted campaign features a national retail promotion, TV commercials and a unique cause initiative that encourages consumers to vote for deserving, sports-focused organizations to which Gatorade will donate on their behalf. 
The retail component includes limited time only bottles featuring athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Paul George and April Ross with a special callout of the For the Love of Sports cause initiative. Gatorade has partnered with a total of 19 sports-focused nonprofit organizations, 5 of which were selected by a roster of athletes featured on the limited time offer bottles. For the remaining 14 organizations, consumers will have the opportunity to vote for their favorite online to receive donations that will help athletes pursue their love of sport. 
We're also driving greater consumption of Quaker Oats in the warmer shoulder season by promoting the concept of overnight oats. We've collaborated with influential foodies to bring consumers quick and easy online tutorials on how to make delicious and nutritious jars of chilled overnight oats, perfect for days when you just need a simple, no-cook recipe. 
And earlier this year, we kicked off Quakers' very first Bring Your Best Bowl contest, a nationwide search for the next Quaker oatmeal flavor. The Bring Your Best Bowl contest highlights the endless ways to enjoy oatmeal, and invited fans across the country to submit their oatmeal creation using 2 to 5 ingredients along with their inspiration for a chance to win $250,000 and have their combination brought to life as Quakers' newest oatmeal flavor. Millions of consumers submitted creations using 2 to 5 ingredients along with the inspiration behind their idea. 
Three finalist flavors are now being developed by Quaker and will be revealed on around National Oatmeal Day, which is October 29. The selected flavors will then be made available in stores across the country for consumers to taste. Then it's up to America to vote online before the winning flavor is revealed in February of 2017. The grand prize winner will take home the cash price along with a chance to have his or her oatmeal combination debut on shelves nationwide. 
At the same time, Frito-Lay drove greater consumer engagement with the Lay's brand by asking Americans to help decide which Lay's flavor stays and which ones go. Lay's Flavor Swap campaign asked Americans to unleash the power of their palates and allow their voices and their taste buds to be heard. Consumers were invited to visit FlavorSwap.com to vote for their favorite flavor in each of the 4 Flavor Swap match-ups. We received millions of customer votes, drove tremendous social media buzz and consumer engagement and strengthened Lay's brand awareness and regard. 
To support trademark Pepsi this summer, we are taking the world's global language, emojis. We're taking it off-line in a visually striking and socially shareable campaign, inviting consumers to #SayItWithPepsi. From a smirk to a kiss to a wink, this initiative connects cola lovers around the world through a common language that is uniquely and definably Pepsi. The PepsiCo design and innovation center created more than 600 PepsiMoji designs, all incorporating the essence of Pepsi, including the brand's iconic globe shape and the colors of blue, red and white. Both globally relevant and locally significant, PepsiMoji's designs come to life across a full Pepsi portfolio and also beyond packaging in unexpected ways, such as a fashion collaboration with designer Jeremy Scott, the limited-edition Pepsi with Jeremy Scott Capsule Collection includes 6 styles of emoji-inspired sunglasses featuring PepsiMoji designs. 
We have partnerships with famed photographer Ben Watts as well as Daniel Arnold, a street photographer with one of today's most enviable Instagram followings. Their work shares a story of #PepsiMoji in the same nonverbal vein as emojis themselves with a quirky, candid and playful tone. 
We also have localized experiential content from vending machines in India that dispense Pepsi product adorned with a PepsiMoji design that matches users' current state of mind to online engagement in Argentina, where consumers can create a personalized PepsiMoji design or use PepsiMoji accessories to fashion their selfies. And we also have a free PepsiMoji keyboard app that can be downloaded at the Apple App or Google Play stores. 
Global television and original digital creative also showcase how communicating through PepsiMoji icons can lead to unpredictable and memorable adventures and experiences. And consumers around the world have already begun to experience #PepsiMoji in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, Russia and Thailand. The global campaign is being featured in more than 100 markets around the world in 2016. 
We're also capitalizing on our partnership with the UEFA Champions League with global activation. Every year, the UEFA Champions League brings together the best teams across Europe to compete in the game's biggest club competition. Fans of the tournament extend far and wide around the world. That's why in more than 100 markets around the globe, PepsiCo executed programs to realize the benefits of our official sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League. From Argentina to Zambia, we have football fans covered with exciting media distro [ph] campaigns tailored to the local market. 
For example, in South Africa, Lay's and Pepsi launched the national #PerfectMatch campaign, reinforcing Lay's and Pepsi as the snack and beverage combination of choice. In Mexico, we ran a Power of One campaign, promoting the concept Pepsi and Sabritas take you to the UEFA Champions League final. And in Chile, we leverage the UEFA Champions League final ship with unique packaging and promotions across our Gatorade, Pepsi and Lay's brands. And we delivered a phenomenal experience of the UEFA Champions League final opening ceremony presented by Pepsi, where Alicia Keys gave an incredible performance, ushering a new live entertainment era at the soccer final. 
The third capability is being a value growth partner with retailers, and we've done this by continuing to drive traffic and basket size through investing in and leveraging consumer and shopper insights, constantly finding new ways to become more efficient and coordinated with our retail partner supply chain and integrating our marketing initiatives with our retailer strategies, including tailored execution of sports, music and other properties. As a consequence, we tend to be among the top drivers of our customers' growth. 
In fact, in the United States, which is our largest market, in the second quarter, we were once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined, more growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. 
The next capability is dialing up end-to-end execution from seed to shelf, making sure our products are fresh and ubiquitously available. We're doing this by using advanced data and analytics to capture more precise demand signal streams from our supply chain and retooling our supply chain and go-to-market systems to improve service, eliminate out-of-stocks and reduce the cycle time from raw material to product on the shelf. 
Our initiatives in this area now include expanding our successful GES program for Frito-Lay North America to our beverage businesses. 
And the fifth and final focus is fueling margin expansion and capability investments with productivity. Year-to-date, core gross margins expanded 100 basis points, and core operating margin expanded 115 basis points even as we continue to invest in A&M, which is up 55 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
In addition to marketing, we also continue to invest in critical capabilities like R&D, the establishment of our global design center and the creation of our global e-commerce growth [ph]. To capture productivity, we are increasingly leveraging automation and advanced technology as well as the development and deployment of global best practices, all to make our supply chain more efficient. 
Let me just give you a few examples from the hundreds of supply chain productivity projects that are currently in flight. We're implementing automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, increasing packaging line speeds by up to 50% while, at the same time, eliminating the bottleneck to total production lines and significantly reducing labor costs. 
To improve our water use efficiency, we have developed and are implementing technology and processes that captures sugar and starch from wastewater streams. The waste sugars and starches are then sold as by-product. The resulting water stream can then be repurposed for secondary manufacturing uses, such as sanitation. 
This not only generates incremental cash flow and saves money, it also reduces our water usage to advance our sustainability agenda. Our Global Operations Group is identifying and then lifting and shifting best practices developed by our manufacturing teams around the world. For example, our manufacturing team in Romania developed a refinement to our potato-cutting process that can reduce raw potato waste by up to 2%. We're now implementing this process improvement in other plants around the globe. We're capturing significant savings by using advanced logistics planning, processes and tools, which enable us to optimize both the mode and routing of material transport. These tools, initially developed and deployed in North America, have been expanded to 9 more countries and are generating 3% to 4% savings in transportation costs. 
And in key markets, we've also advanced our third-party transportation procurement process by consolidating all transport origin-destination pairs across our food and beverage businesses to present to the market for competitive bids, and we have the opportunity to expand this process to many more markets. Productivity is also being captured through the implementation of our Smart Spending program, which is driving meaningful reductions in key discretionary spending areas like travel, facilities and consulting. We are attacking spending on both rate and volume dimensions. 
So for example, in travel, we've adopted much more stringent policies governing mode and class of travel, hotel rate and per diem meal limits, all of which have reduced the rate element of the costs. But we've also mandated and encouraged working in ways to reduce the volume element of costs. So for example, we've reduced meeting-related travel by insisting on the use of teleconferencing in place of physical meetings in many instances. 
And as a result of all of our productivity efforts, we're capturing significant savings that are delivering meaningful margin improvement and also providing the funding necessary to invest in the long-term health of the business. Taken together, our top line-driving commercial activities and our robust productivity agenda are helping us deliver our financial targets despite continuing macro challenges. 
We are aggressively driving innovation, marketing, marketplace execution productivity to deliver balanced and sustainable performance. We are confident we have the right plans in place and believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2016 targets, including our increased core constant currency EPS outlook, which we announced this morning. 
Just as important, we continue to invest in capabilities and to transform our portfolio to succeed in the dynamic customer and consumer landscapes with a singular goal of generating sustainable shareholder value for the long term. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first half, and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of the year. And so as you saw on this morning's release, we've raised our full year core EPS target to $4.71, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency growth of 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela; a negative 2 percentage point impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation; and a negative 4 percentage point impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus. 
Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged, and are set out in this morning's release. Our efforts to improve working capital continue to yield positive results. Over the past year, we have improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days. 
For analysts on the call, as you update your models, I ask that you consider the following factors: Foreign exchange translation continues to be a headwind, more heavily skewed to Q3 than Q4. We have more difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the second half at Frito-Lay North America. North America Beverages has particularly difficult revenue and operating profit laps in Q3. We expect low single-digit raw material inflation, including the impacts of foreign exchange translation in the second half compared to modest deflation in the first half. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including an expected increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela core earnings of approximately $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect the balance-of-year core EPS growth to be generated entirely in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, operator, we'll take the first question."

Look, the macro snack category is a big category, and we're only playing in the salty-snack category, expanding into savory snacks. And our goal -- and if you go back maybe 15 years ago, and we've been consistent in this strategy, we've always said grow the core and add more. Inside of the core, we've used these words, and that's what Frito-Lay has been doing, solidify our position in salty-snacks and start to step out of the core into other savory snacks and then start to take on other occasions from the overall macro snack category. So all the work we've done in demand spaces says that there is huge opportunity as the world starts to swing more and more towards the liking for savory products. So savory is in, and we see amazing opportunities ahead for Frito-Lay to grow its business. Secondly, Frito-Lay has been a mainstream competitor. We haven't played as much in the premium part of the portfolio. And now we've gotten our game together in the premium side, and we are seeing growth and, as I mentioned in the script, the premium part of the portfolio grew 4x faster. And we are just getting started. So we see tremendous opportunities for Frito-Lay to grow in the premium side. And I'll make one final comment, Bill, before I toss it to Hugh to talk about productivity. The great thing about Frito-Lay is that we've got a great brand. We've got a great innovation capability, but we've brought an amazing pipeline to the customer and consumer. Our DSD system is a well-oiled machine, and we can keep expanding the diameter of that pipeline. And it's really our imagination in terms of what products we can innovate with to put through that pipeline. So with that, Hugh, let me turn it you to talk about the margins at Frito."

A couple of comments on margins, and the short answer is I think Frito-Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in it, and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way. Why do I say that? Number one, it's to build on the commentary that Indra just made. While we are the market leaders in premium, we are relatively underpenetrated compared to where we are in mainstream, and premium does offer very, very attractive margins, particularly as you scale it over time. So I think there's a significant margin uplift there. Number two is in the area of GES, the initiative that we've been working on for a number of years, where we shorten the supply chain, deliver product to the customer and, ultimately, to the consumer much more quickly by going essentially direct from plant to store before going from plant to cross-dock to store. The benefit of that is we obviously eliminate a lot of excess cost in the system. And as we take that excess cost out, we are reinvesting some back in premium, and we're delivering some to the bottom line. To use the baseball metaphor that you used earlier, we're really only in about the fourth or fifth inning on GES. GES has a number of years to run. And in fact, I think the GES impact on the financials are likely to be more profound in the future than they have in the past. And then the third element to this is this whole area of Smart Spending. Frito-Lay has absolutely taken the ball and run with Smart Spending as they always do, but we're really only right now exploiting 4 out of what could potentially be about 30 categories in Smart Spending. So I think Smart Spending also offers us years of runway to deliver additional productivity. So if you put all of that together, premium, plus GES, plus Smart Spending and combine that with the fact that Frito-Lay's strong market position gives it the ability to scale things in ways that none of its competitors can, I think we have many years of margin improvement to come and, frankly, significant margin improvement to come at Frito."

There's also a significant piece of it in the selling systems, which fall into SG&A. That's primarily the DSD system. We've got lots of room to be more efficient on that. We're really very much in the early innings on that. Number two, we do continue to streamline the organization. And number three, Smart Spending is having a significant impact on our SG&A spending.

So there has not been a deterioration, which obviously is to our benefit relative to our expectations. And number two, we do see significant innovation launching in the back half of the year that we're quite optimistic about. Some of the things you've seen more recently that Indra mentioned, whether it's Mtn Dew Black Label, Aquafina Sparkling, 1893, the Simply line at Tostitos down at Frito or Quaker Breakfast Flats, which are doing terrifically well and in it coming out of Quaker as well, when you put together all of that innovation, it will have a disproportionate impact in the back half of the year, which is really our cause for optimism in the balance of year.

Let me talk about Diet Pepsi, Judy. You know what's interesting? If you go and poll consumers today and read all the social media reports, there's still trepidation about aspartame. There's no scientific reason for that, but people are somehow worried about aspartame. And when we launched Diet Pepsi aspartame-free, it's because there was a huge consumer need for that product. What we did not anticipate is that there's a group of consumers that absolutely loved the original Diet Pepsi. And in the cola category, in particular, because it's been optimized over years, people get incredibly fastidious about their products and don't want to have any changes. So rather than remove the aspartame free, which is still loved by a lot of people -- in fact, I tell you when we announced that we were bringing back the old Diet Pepsi, a few people who thought aspartame-free was going away wrote me some pretty tough e-mails. And so there is a very loyal group that is thrilled that we have an aspartame-free following. So we brought back the original Diet Pepsi in addition to keeping the aspartame-free products so we could serve all consumers with the products that they love. I think that's going to be net positive for us. Now let me just say, the marketplace is fragmenting. Forget Pepsi or Diet Pepsi or the cola category. Any new category that is expanding is becoming more niche, more fragmented, and that's why it was important for us to own the distribution system because once you have control over the distribution system, you can pump a lot of niche products through it. All our craft products, all of those are low-volume products. So we have to learn how to handle complexity, not walk away from it. So Hugh, talk about capital allocation then portfolio..."

And I'll -- let me just start with a bit of historical perspective on this because, obviously, there's lots of activity in terms of people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a reminder, we have about a littl",445,"Yes, sure, happy to, Judy. And I'll -- let me just start with a bit of historical perspective on this because, obviously, there's lots of activity in terms of people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a reminder, we have about a little over 1/4 of our portfolio in nutrition, and then if you add in the Better-for-You products, it's really -- it gets upwards to almost half of our portfolio in terms of the balance that we have right now. We're also, from a developing and emerging markets perspective, about 1/3 exposed to developing and emerging markets. All of that is a result of transactions that we've executed really over the last decade or even more, whether it's Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana, Naked Juice, Wimm-Bill-Dann, IZZE, we've executed a variety of transactions over the last 10-plus years in order to get the portfolio into a place where it could consistently deliver performance. And frankly, that's what you've seen is this portfolio now, regardless of economic cycle, regardless of consumer sentiment, regardless of consumer trends and shifts, seems to be capable and has been capable of delivering good, strong performance throughout all of those shifts. As we look at things going forward, what we've said is we intend to expend something on the order of $500 million a year in tuck-in acquisitions. As those good opportunities emerge, we look at them, and we look at them through 2 lenses: one is a strategic lens around, does it make sense where -- relative to where we think the consumer is going; and second is obviously a financial lens, is this good for our shareholders? And you can count on us to continue to do that because we think that's the right way to think about M&A on a go-forward basis. I will also tell you that we look at everything. We've looked at everything that has transacted and probably every company that hasn't transacted. And if something transacts, and we're not a part of it, you can very reasonably assume it's because we didn't want to be. So the result of that is we feel like we're operating from a position of strength. We feel like we're in a position, right now, where we'll continue to look at things. We'll do things if they make sense, but the guidance that we've given right now is the guidance that makes sense, and that's the way we're thinking about it going forward. Some investors talk about the notion of sell when everyone's buying and buy when everyone's selling. We tend to be good stewards of capital, and we watch -- we follow that maxim fairly closely."

It's been LRB for the last decade or so, and I think the sooner we can shift our frame of reference, the better it is because just beating a category that is in secular decline, just beating that all the time is not a game to play. That's not a game that is going to guarantee good results. If we play this rich LRB game, multicategory, placing the bets where the growth is and where the consumer is going, I think we're better off. So my request to you and to all of you who are tracking the company in this category, expand your aperture. LRB is the game to play. That's the game we're playing, and we watch LRB share very, very carefully. That's the right strategy for any company."

We had more than 2% organic volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages. While foreign exchange translations continue to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 3% organic revenue growth led by Frito-Lay North America, AMENA and Latin America. ESSA delivered operating margin expansion together with increased A&M investment. 
North American Beverages delivered solid net price realization and margin expansion. And Quaker Foods North America had very strong net revenue and operating profit growth. And positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program, drove 80 basis points of core operating margin expansion. 
At the same time, we continue to invest in advertising and marketing, which increased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter, and our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue almost 7% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Mexico, Turkey and Egypt. 
In our developed markets, growth was led by the United States, where we grew revenue more than 2%. In fact, on a stand-alone basis, Frito-Lay was the largest contributor to growth at retail and gained value share in both salty and macro snacks. North American Beverages maintained its value share leadership and possesses 5 of the 10 top beverage trademarks based on dollar sales: Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lipton and Starbucks. And Quaker gained almost 1.5 value share points in hot cereal while accounting for 100% of category retail sales growth. 
Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Organic revenue grew 3.4%. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% and up 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 8% but up 10%, excluding the Venezuela impact. 
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.71 from our previous target of $4.66, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
Specifically, there are 5 things we focus on to deliver in what continues to be a challenging macroenvironment: first, consumer-centric, relentless innovation; second, connecting with digital age consumers in new ways; third, being a true growth partner to our customers; fourth, flawless end-to-end execution; and fifth, a maniacal focus on productivity. 
Let me touch on each briefly. Product innovation and portfolio transformation are enabling us to provide consumers the delicious and convenient products they want and to satisfy their constantly evolving demands across a broad spectrum of occasions and need states. We have ramped up our innovation engine and, as a result, new products comprise approximately 9% of sales or over $5 billion. We've achieved this by leveraging our global scale while simultaneously tailoring products to appeal to local tastes, addressing consumers' evolving demands for convenience, taste and variety from the occasional treat to nutrition by transforming our product portfolio. 
So today, what we refer to as guilt-free products generates approximately 45% of our net revenue. And we are now recognizing consumers' interest in craft, niche and premium products. So for example, in beverages, Gatorade continues to innovate in new areas of sports hydration with the introduction of the G Frost flavor lineup, while Propel by the Makers of Gatorade drove more than 40% of the enhanced water category volume growth year-to-date. 
Following on the success of Mountain Dew Kickstart, we've introduced Mtn Dew Black Label, a deeper, darker dew made with real sugar and crafted with dark berry flavor and herbal bitters. Mtn Dew Black Label is for those times when DEW Nation wants to live it up with a touch of class. Dew Black Label is initially released exclusively at approximately 600 colleges and universities, giving students a first taste of the unique beverage, and demand for the product built as word quickly spread across social media. 
Along with the nationwide of release Mtn Dew Black Label, the brand is extending its boldly refined campaign. It started with activation during the SXSW music conference and festival in Austin, which included the Mtn Dew Black Label parlor, a SXSW takeover concert, and product seeding at local bars and venues. The campaign continued with the release of a new digital sport called gentlemen of the jacket. The content showcases different gentlemen skaters, including DEW athlete and pro skateboarder, Theotis Beasley; mixologists and gamers, all crossing over to the classier side of DEW with the help of putting on a unique jacket, transforming worlds they are in to become a more refined version of itself, yet still getting at the heart of all things DEW. 
In the second quarter, we also launched Aquafina Sparkling, a new line of flavored sparkling water that provides a light and naturally sweetened hydration option. Aquafina Sparkling is offered in 3 delicious fruit flavors: Black Cherry Dragonfruit, Lemon Lime and Orange Grapefruit. Each sleek single-serve 12-ounce can contains just 10 calories and the tiniest pinch of Fair Trade Certified sugar for a smooth, crisp finish. Aquafina Sparkling will also be available in multipacks containing 2 flavors. 
We're also appealing to consumers' desire for discovery and more premium experiences. Naked Juice launched a line of cold-pressed juices branded Naked Pressed. It provides a new take on fresh taste, and the line comes in 5 varieties. It's sourced from cold-pressed whole fruits and vegetables and is Non-GMO Project Verified. 
And Pepsi has introduced 1893 from the Makers of Pepsi-Cola. It capitalizes on the cultural food revolution and is inspired by consumer interest in bold and interesting taste combinations. 1893 is packaged in sleek and premium 12-ounce cans and brings together premium ingredients and more than 100 years of cola-making expertise to present a great tasting, unexpectedly bold experience. 1893 is a blend of premium kola nut extract, real sugar and sparkling water available in 2 delicious flavors: Original and Ginger Cola. 1893 can be enjoyed as a delicious stand-alone beverage and is also the perfect complement for cocktails. 
In the Quaker business. Because consumers are increasingly seeking greater convenience, portability and nutrition in their breakfast, we've introduced Quaker Breakfast Flats, crispy baked snack bars that contains delicious ingredients that you can see, like oats, real pieces of fruit, crunchy nuts, flax and sunflower seeds. Each serving contains 18 grams of whole grains with less than 200 calories and no artificial flavors or added colors. Quaker Breakfast Flats comes in 3 delicious flavors, including Cranberry Almond, Banana Honey Nut and Golden Raisin Cinnamon. 
Turning to Frito-Lay. We continue to expand our portfolio with a particular focus on premium offerings and healthy snacking options. So for example, we've expanded our Simply line with the introduction of Simply Tostitos black bean chips made from real black beans. It's Non-GMO Project Verified, and Simply Tostitos black bean chips offer consumers an excellent source of fiber with 5 grams per 1-ounce serving. And this Simply line has also introduced Simply Tostitos organic chunky medium salsa and Simply Tostitos organic black bean and corn mild salsa, and both salsa varieties are USDA certified organic. 
SunChips has introduced Veggie Harvest Farmhouse Ranch Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain; and Veggie Harvest Tomato, Basil & Cheese Flavored Veggie & Wholegrain, and both are made with real veggies and whole grains. And Smartfood has introduced Smartfood Delight Sea Salted Caramel Flavored Popcorn, which offers 50% less fat when compared to regular Smartfood White Cheddar Popcorn. It offers 100% whole grains and 35 calories per cup. 
So as a result of initiatives like this year-to-date, our Frito-Lay U.S. premium portfolio growth is outpacing the growth in the balance of the portfolio by a factor of more than 4x, and we're extending our value share leadership position in premium salty-snacks. So that's innovation. 
The second capability I mentioned is connecting with consumers in the age of social and digital media and the purpose-driven consumer. So this summer, Gatorade is running For the Love of Sports, a national campaign that encourages athletes to think about and hold on to that moment when they were younger and first fell in love with sport. The multifaceted campaign features a national retail promotion, TV commercials and a unique cause initiative that encourages consumers to vote for deserving, sports-focused organizations to which Gatorade will donate on their behalf. 
The retail component includes limited time only bottles featuring athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Paul George and April Ross with a special callout of the For the Love of Sports cause initiative. Gatorade has partnered with a total of 19 sports-focused nonprofit organizations, 5 of which were selected by a roster of athletes featured on the limited time offer bottles. For the remaining 14 organizations, consumers will have the opportunity to vote for their favorite online to receive donations that will help athletes pursue their love of sport. 
We're also driving greater consumption of Quaker Oats in the warmer shoulder season by promoting the concept of overnight oats. We've collaborated with influential foodies to bring consumers quick and easy online tutorials on how to make delicious and nutritious jars of chilled overnight oats, perfect for days when you just need a simple, no-cook recipe. 
And earlier this year, we kicked off Quakers' very first Bring Your Best Bowl contest, a nationwide search for the next Quaker oatmeal flavor. The Bring Your Best Bowl contest highlights the endless ways to enjoy oatmeal, and invited fans across the country to submit their oatmeal creation using 2 to 5 ingredients along with their inspiration for a chance to win $250,000 and have their combination brought to life as Quakers' newest oatmeal flavor. Millions of consumers submitted creations using 2 to 5 ingredients along with the inspiration behind their idea. 
Three finalist flavors are now being developed by Quaker and will be revealed on around National Oatmeal Day, which is October 29. The selected flavors will then be made available in stores across the country for consumers to taste. Then it's up to America to vote online before the winning flavor is revealed in February of 2017. The grand prize winner will take home the cash price along with a chance to have his or her oatmeal combination debut on shelves nationwide. 
At the same time, Frito-Lay drove greater consumer engagement with the Lay's brand by asking Americans to help decide which Lay's flavor stays and which ones go. Lay's Flavor Swap campaign asked Americans to unleash the power of their palates and allow their voices and their taste buds to be heard. Consumers were invited to visit FlavorSwap.com to vote for their favorite flavor in each of the 4 Flavor Swap match-ups. We received millions of customer votes, drove tremendous social media buzz and consumer engagement and strengthened Lay's brand awareness and regard. 
To support trademark Pepsi this summer, we are taking the world's global language, emojis. We're taking it off-line in a visually striking and socially shareable campaign, inviting consumers to #SayItWithPepsi. From a smirk to a kiss to a wink, this initiative connects cola lovers around the world through a common language that is uniquely and definably Pepsi. The PepsiCo design and innovation center created more than 600 PepsiMoji designs, all incorporating the essence of Pepsi, including the brand's iconic globe shape and the colors of blue, red and white. Both globally relevant and locally significant, PepsiMoji's designs come to life across a full Pepsi portfolio and also beyond packaging in unexpected ways, such as a fashion collaboration with designer Jeremy Scott, the limited-edition Pepsi with Jeremy Scott Capsule Collection includes 6 styles of emoji-inspired sunglasses featuring PepsiMoji designs. 
We have partnerships with famed photographer Ben Watts as well as Daniel Arnold, a street photographer with one of today's most enviable Instagram followings. Their work shares a story of #PepsiMoji in the same nonverbal vein as emojis themselves with a quirky, candid and playful tone. 
We also have localized experiential content from vending machines in India that dispense Pepsi product adorned with a PepsiMoji design that matches users' current state of mind to online engagement in Argentina, where consumers can create a personalized PepsiMoji design or use PepsiMoji accessories to fashion their selfies. And we also have a free PepsiMoji keyboard app that can be downloaded at the Apple App or Google Play stores. 
Global television and original digital creative also showcase how communicating through PepsiMoji icons can lead to unpredictable and memorable adventures and experiences. And consumers around the world have already begun to experience #PepsiMoji in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, Russia and Thailand. The global campaign is being featured in more than 100 markets around the world in 2016. 
We're also capitalizing on our partnership with the UEFA Champions League with global activation. Every year, the UEFA Champions League brings together the best teams across Europe to compete in the game's biggest club competition. Fans of the tournament extend far and wide around the world. That's why in more than 100 markets around the globe, PepsiCo executed programs to realize the benefits of our official sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League. From Argentina to Zambia, we have football fans covered with exciting media distro [ph] campaigns tailored to the local market. 
For example, in South Africa, Lay's and Pepsi launched the national #PerfectMatch campaign, reinforcing Lay's and Pepsi as the snack and beverage combination of choice. In Mexico, we ran a Power of One campaign, promoting the concept Pepsi and Sabritas take you to the UEFA Champions League final. And in Chile, we leverage the UEFA Champions League final ship with unique packaging and promotions across our Gatorade, Pepsi and Lay's brands. And we delivered a phenomenal experience of the UEFA Champions League final opening ceremony presented by Pepsi, where Alicia Keys gave an incredible performance, ushering a new live entertainment era at the soccer final. 
The third capability is being a value growth partner with retailers, and we've done this by continuing to drive traffic and basket size through investing in and leveraging consumer and shopper insights, constantly finding new ways to become more efficient and coordinated with our retail partner supply chain and integrating our marketing initiatives with our retailer strategies, including tailored execution of sports, music and other properties. As a consequence, we tend to be among the top drivers of our customers' growth. 
In fact, in the United States, which is our largest market, in the second quarter, we were once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined, more growth at retail than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. 
The next capability is dialing up end-to-end execution from seed to shelf, making sure our products are fresh and ubiquitously available. We're doing this by using advanced data and analytics to capture more precise demand signal streams from our supply chain and retooling our supply chain and go-to-market systems to improve service, eliminate out-of-stocks and reduce the cycle time from raw material to product on the shelf. 
Our initiatives in this area now include expanding our successful GES program for Frito-Lay North America to our beverage businesses. 
And the fifth and final focus is fueling margin expansion and capability investments with productivity. Year-to-date, core gross margins expanded 100 basis points, and core operating margin expanded 115 basis points even as we continue to invest in A&M, which is up 55 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
In addition to marketing, we also continue to invest in critical capabilities like R&D, the establishment of our global design center and the creation of our global e-commerce growth [ph]. To capture productivity, we are increasingly leveraging automation and advanced technology as well as the development and deployment of global best practices, all to make our supply chain more efficient. 
Let me just give you a few examples from the hundreds of supply chain productivity projects that are currently in flight. We're implementing automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, increasing packaging line speeds by up to 50% while, at the same time, eliminating the bottleneck to total production lines and significantly reducing labor costs. 
To improve our water use efficiency, we have developed and are implementing technology and processes that captures sugar and starch from wastewater streams. The waste sugars and starches are then sold as by-product. The resulting water stream can then be repurposed for secondary manufacturing uses, such as sanitation. 
This not only generates incremental cash flow and saves money, it also reduces our water usage to advance our sustainability agenda. Our Global Operations Group is identifying and then lifting and shifting best practices developed by our manufacturing teams around the world. For example, our manufacturing team in Romania developed a refinement to our potato-cutting process that can reduce raw potato waste by up to 2%. We're now implementing this process improvement in other plants around the globe. We're capturing significant savings by using advanced logistics planning, processes and tools, which enable us to optimize both the mode and routing of material transport. These tools, initially developed and deployed in North America, have been expanded to 9 more countries and are generating 3% to 4% savings in transportation costs. 
And in key markets, we've also advanced our third-party transportation procurement process by consolidating all transport origin-destination pairs across our food and beverage businesses to present to the market for competitive bids, and we have the opportunity to expand this process to many more markets. Productivity is also being captured through the implementation of our Smart Spending program, which is driving meaningful reductions in key discretionary spending areas like travel, facilities and consulting. We are attacking spending on both rate and volume dimensions. 
So for example, in travel, we've adopted much more stringent policies governing mode and class of travel, hotel rate and per diem meal limits, all of which have reduced the rate element of the costs. But we've also mandated and encouraged working in ways to reduce the volume element of costs. So for example, we've reduced meeting-related travel by insisting on the use of teleconferencing in place of physical meetings in many instances. 
And as a result of all of our productivity efforts, we're capturing significant savings that are delivering meaningful margin improvement and also providing the funding necessary to invest in the long-term health of the business. Taken together, our top line-driving commercial activities and our robust productivity agenda are helping us deliver our financial targets despite continuing macro challenges. 
We are aggressively driving innovation, marketing, marketplace execution productivity to deliver balanced and sustainable performance. We are confident we have the right plans in place and believe we are well positioned to achieve our 2016 targets, including our increased core constant currency EPS outlook, which we announced this morning. 
Just as important, we continue to invest in capabilities and to transform our portfolio to succeed in the dynamic customer and consumer landscapes with a singular goal of generating sustainable shareholder value for the long term. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first half, and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of the year. And so as you saw on this morning's release, we'",308,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first half, and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of the year. And so as you saw on this morning's release, we've raised our full year core EPS target to $4.71, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency growth of 9%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela; a negative 2 percentage point impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation; and a negative 4 percentage point impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus. 
Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged, and are set out in this morning's release. Our efforts to improve working capital continue to yield positive results. Over the past year, we have improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days. 
For analysts on the call, as you update your models, I ask that you consider the following factors: Foreign exchange translation continues to be a headwind, more heavily skewed to Q3 than Q4. We have more difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the second half at Frito-Lay North America. North America Beverages has particularly difficult revenue and operating profit laps in Q3. We expect low single-digit raw material inflation, including the impacts of foreign exchange translation in the second half compared to modest deflation in the first half. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including an expected increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela core earnings of approximately $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect the balance-of-year core EPS growth to be generated entirely in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, operator, we'll take the first question."

Look, the macro snack category is a big category, and we're only playing in the salty-snack category, expanding into savory snacks. And our goal -- and if you go back maybe 15 years ago, and we've been consistent in this strategy, we've always said grow the core and add more. Inside of the core, we've used these words, and that's what Frito-Lay has been doing, solidify our position in salty-snacks and start to step out of the core into other savory snacks and then start to take on other occasions from the overall macro snack category. So all the work we've done in demand spaces says that there is huge opportunity as the world starts to swing more and more towards the liking for savory products. So savory is in, and we see amazing opportunities ahead for Frito-Lay to grow its business. Secondly, Frito-Lay has been a mainstream competitor. We haven't played as much in the premium part of the portfolio. And now we've gotten our game together in the premium side, and we are seeing growth and, as I mentioned in the script, the premium part of the portfolio grew 4x faster. And we are just getting started. So we see tremendous opportunities for Frito-Lay to grow in the premium side. And I'll make one final comment, Bill, before I toss it to Hugh to talk about productivity. The great thing about Frito-Lay is that we've got a great brand. We've got a great innovation capability, but we've brought an amazing pipeline to the customer and consumer. Our DSD system is a well-oiled machine, and we can keep expanding the diameter of that pipeline. And it's really our imagination in terms of what products we can innovate with to put through that pipeline. So with that, Hugh, let me turn it you to talk about the margins at Frito."

A couple of comments on margins, and the short answer is I think Frito-Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in it, and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way. Why do I say that? Number one, it's to build on the commentary that Indra just made. While we are the market leaders in premium, we are relatively underpenetrated compared to where we are in mainstream, and premium does offer very, very attractive margins, particularly as you scale it over time. So I think there's a significant margin uplift there. Number two is in the area of GES, the initiative that we've been working on for a number of years, where we shorten the supply chain, deliver product to the customer and, ultimately, to the consumer much more quickly by going essentially direct from plant to store before going from plant to cross-dock to store. The benefit of that is we obviously eliminate a lot of excess cost in the system. And as we take that excess cost out, we are reinvesting some back in premium, and we're delivering some to the bottom line. To use the baseball metaphor that you used earlier, we're really only in about the fourth or fifth inning on GES. GES has a number of years to run. And in fact, I think the GES impact on the financials are likely to be more profound in the future than they have in the past. And then the third element to this is this whole area of Smart Spending. Frito-Lay has absolutely taken the ball and run with Smart Spending as they always do, but we're really only right now exploiting 4 out of what could potentially be about 30 categories in Smart Spending. So I think Smart Spending also offers us years of runway to deliver additional productivity. So if you put all of that together, premium, plus GES, plus Smart Spending and combine that with the fact that Frito-Lay's strong market position gives it the ability to scale things in ways that none of its competitors can, I think we have many years of margin improvement to come and, frankly, significant margin improvement to come at Frito."

There's also a significant piece of it in the selling systems, which fall into SG&A. That's primarily the DSD system. We've got lots of room to be more efficient on that. We're really very much in the early innings on that. Number two, we do continue to streamline the organization. And number three, Smart Spending is having a significant impact on our SG&A spending.

It's clearly not macros. You knew the Q4 compares, so trying to get a sense there. That's question one. Question two, and Indra don't take this the wrong way at all, in fact, take it very positively but there continues to be kind of a real thoughtful set of questions from important investors about your future at Pepsi versus, for example, any future presidential administration.

So there has not been a deterioration, which obviously is to our benefit relative to our expectations. And number two, we do see significant innovation launching in the back half of the year that we're quite optimistic about. Some of the things you've seen more recently that Indra mentioned, whether it's Mtn Dew Black Label, Aquafina Sparkling, 1893, the Simply line at Tostitos down at Frito or Quaker Breakfast Flats, which are doing terrifically well and in it coming out of Quaker as well, when you put together all of that innovation, it will have a disproportionate impact in the back half of the year, which is really our cause for optimism in the balance of year.

Let me talk about Diet Pepsi, Judy. You know what's interesting? If you go and poll consumers today and read all the social media reports, there's still trepidation about aspartame. There's no scientific reason for that, but people are somehow worried about aspartame. And when we launched Diet Pepsi aspartame-free, it's because there was a huge consumer need for that product. What we did not anticipate is that there's a group of consumers that absolutely loved the original Diet Pepsi. And in the cola category, in particular, because it's been optimized over years, people get incredibly fastidious about their products and don't want to have any changes. So rather than remove the aspartame free, which is still loved by a lot of people -- in fact, I tell you when we announced that we were bringing back the old Diet Pepsi, a few people who thought aspartame-free was going away wrote me some pretty tough e-mails. And so there is a very loyal group that is thrilled that we have an aspartame-free following. So we brought back the original Diet Pepsi in addition to keeping the aspartame-free products so we could serve all consumers with the products that they love. I think that's going to be net positive for us. Now let me just say, the marketplace is fragmenting. Forget Pepsi or Diet Pepsi or the cola category. Any new category that is expanding is becoming more niche, more fragmented, and that's why it was important for us to own the distribution system because once you have control over the distribution system, you can pump a lot of niche products through it. All our craft products, all of those are low-volume products. So we have to learn how to handle complexity, not walk away from it. So Hugh, talk about capital allocation then portfolio..."

And I'll -- let me just start with a bit of historical perspective on this because, obviously, there's lots of activity in terms of people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a reminder, we have about a little over 1/4 of our portfolio in nutrition, and then if you add in the Better-for-You products, it's really -- it gets upwards to almost half of our portfolio in terms of the balance that we have right now. We're also, from a developing and emerging markets perspective, about 1/3 exposed to developing and emerging markets. All of that is a result of transactions that we've executed really over the last decade or even more, whether it's Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana, Naked Juice, Wimm-Bill-Dann, IZZE, we've executed a variety of transactions over the last 10-plus years in order to get the portfolio into a place where it could consistently deliver performance. And frankly, that's what you've seen is this portfolio now, regardless of economic cycle, regardless of consumer sentiment, regardless of consumer trends and shifts, seems to be capable and has been capable of delivering good, strong performance throughout all of those shifts. As we look at things going forward, what we've said is we intend to expend something on the order of $500 million a year in tuck-in acquisitions. As those good opportunities emerge, we look at them, and we look at them through 2 lenses: one is a strategic lens around, does it make sense where -- relative to where we think the consumer is going; and second is obviously a financial lens, is this good for our shareholders? And you can count on us to continue to do that because we think that's the right way to think about M&A on a go-forward basis. I will also tell you that we look at everything. We've looked at everything that has transacted and probably every company that hasn't transacted. And if something transacts, and we're not a part of it, you can very reasonably assume it's because we didn't want to be. So the result of that is we feel like we're operating from a position of strength. We feel like we're in a position, right now, where we'll continue to look at things. We'll do things if they make sense, but the guidance that we've given right now is the guidance that makes sense, and that's the way we're thinking about it going forward. Some investors talk about the notion of sell when everyone's buying and buy when everyone's selling. We tend to be good stewards of capital, and we watch -- we follow that maxim fairly closely."

In the case of Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, that is not -- has not been the case from what I can see, and so how do you maintain your shelf space? How do you think about strategically moving those in a different direction? Is it through fragmentation? Or is there something else you need to do? Because that seems to be one area where you're really losing share."

That's not a game that is going to guarantee good results. If we play this rich LRB game, multicategory, placing the bets where the growth is and where the consumer is going, I think we're better off. So my request to you and to all of you who are tracking the company in this category, expand your aperture. LRB is the game to play. That's the game we're playing, and we watch LRB share very, very carefully. That's the right strategy for any company."

I'm pleased to report our businesses continue to perform well in the third quarter. Specifically, we had more than 3% organic volume growth in global snacks and more than 2% organic volume growth in global beverages. While foreign exchange translation continue to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 4% organic revenue growth, which represents an acceleration from the first half. We generated positive net price realization in total. We set up investments in our brands with A&M up 65 basis points as a percent of net revenue and made incremental marketplace investments. We expanded gross and operating margins. We grew core constant currency operating profit 2% and up 6%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11%, excluding the Venezuelan impact. 
Our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue 8% for the quarter with double-digit organic revenue growth in a number of markets, including China, Mexico, Brazil and Egypt. And our developed markets grew organic revenue 3%, led by low Frito-Lay North American and North American Beverages. Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Core constant operating profit growth grew 5% and up 8% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the Venezuela impact.
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78 from our previous target of $4.71 driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
In addition to our financial results, we're also delivering on other key performance metrics. Innovation drive approximately 9% of net revenue in the quarter, advertising and marketing is up another 60 basis points as a percent of net revenue year-to-date and execution metrics are improving across the board driving growth for us and our retail partners. For example, in the third quarter in the U.S., which is our largest market, we were once again the largest contributor to retail food and beverage sales growth. We generated approximately 37% of all food and beverage retail sales growth, significantly higher than our food and beverage dollar share position of less than 10%. And we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. We're on track to deliver $1 billion in productivity savings in 2016 and we're on track to deliver $7 billion in free cash flow excluding certain items. 
Our results reflect our commitment to performance and purpose, PepsiCo's vision to deliver top-tier financial performance over the long term by integrating sustainability into our business strategy. When we launched performance and purpose in 2006, we opted not to use sustainability simply through the lens of corporate social responsibility. Instead, we charted a course rooted in the firm belief that in order to meet the changing needs of our consumers, exercise responsible stewardship for environment and create an environment within our company where each employee feels valued and can bring their whole selves to work, we have to transform the way we do business, willing sustainability into the way we make money. A decade into our journey, that belief is being validated and is propelling our company forward as this quarter's financial results demonstrate. 
On the purpose side of performance and purpose, our first commitment was human sustainability, transforming our product portfolio with a particular focus on reducing sodium, saturated fat and added sugars, while dialing up on nutrition investments. And we're pleased with the progress we've made.
As compared to 2006, we have reduced the average sodium in our food products by 11% per serving and removed more than 2,300 metric tons of sodium from key global food brands in key countries. We've reduced our average amount of saturated fats per serving by more than 15% in key global brands in a number of our major markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, China and Turkey. And we're making strides to reduce added sugars in our beverages through reformulation. Our transformation efforts to-date have resulted in the portfolio where we derive approximately 45% of our net revenue from products that we refer to as guilt-free, those products include diet and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. And on food, 27 points of the 45 points is made up of what we refer to as everyday nutrition, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, proteins, and unsweetened tea and water. 
And our innovation focus reflects our commitment to portfolio transformation. Just to give you a few examples, recently, we launched Quaker Super Goodness porridge sachets in the U.K. made with whole grain oats, quinoa, barley and flaxseed. And introduced carrot, pineapple, mango Tropicana Farmstand in the U.S. made with 100% food and vegetable juices and no added sugar. Sabra built in the strength of a highly popular hummus and established a range of authentic products that include guacamole, salsa, Baba ghanoush and greek yogurt dips and spreads. Sabra now generates approximately $800 million in estimated annual retail sales in the United States well on its way becoming a $1 billion brand.
Our Naked superpremium fruit and vegetables juices and coconut waters are loved by consumers with their great flavor, all-natural ingredients and no added sugars or preservatives. We have doubled Naked's net revenue over the last 6 years and grown estimated annual retail sales to over $1 billion. We recently extended the Naked line up with the introduction of Naked coldpressed juices. 
Propel water, by the makers of Gatorade, a 0-calories sports hydration beverages enriched with electrolytes and minerals is enjoying renewed success in North America with year-to-date volume up 6%.
We've also successfully expanded what we refer to as our guilt-free product lineup. [indiscernible] is an example, a premium line of ready-to-drink teas, brewed and steamed simply and authentically from leaves picked at their freshest. Since this launch in 2012, Pure Leaf has grown to more than $650 million in estimated annual retail sales. We're now elevating Pure Leaf into a superpremium line and under the Tea House collection. 
Our Bake line up is another example of how we are transforming our portfolio. Spurred by the success of the Baked Lay's, we have broadened our Baked lineup to include Baked Doritos, Baked Tostitos and Baked Cheetos and have expanded the lineup to 9 international markets, that is a lot of opportunity for further growth and market expansion. 
And we recently launched Stubborn Soda, a new generation premium crafted sparkling beverage that is just 90to 100 calories per 12 ounces and is made by [indiscernible] certified cane sugar and stevia with no high fructose corn syrup.
So it's the birth of our evolving product portfolio and our ability to innovate against it that enables us to generate consistent organic revenue growth. 
Likewise under performance and purpose, our sustainability agenda had positive impacts, both in our business results and more broadly on the planet we share. By using fewer resources, water, packaging and energy, we are simultaneously shrinking our environmental footprint and reducing our operating cost. We improved our water stewardship by adopting new technologies and processes, which have steadily reduce our water use by production and implement it integrated water should management and water scarce areas. As a result, today, we're using approximately 25% less water per unit of production than we did when we embarked on performance and purpose. In addition, we supported growers in our value chain and their pursuits of better use water management. And through the PepsiCo Foundation, we have successfully partnered to provide access to safe water for more than 9 million people globally.
We're also using less packaging and generating less Landfield waste. We have successfully reduced packaging weight and size and increased forced consumer recycled content in our packaging. While reducing packaging weight and size, we removed almost 100 million pounds of packaging materials from the market in 2015 alone. We have worked to increase the recycling rates of beverage containers among consumers and we have significantly reduce the amount of solid waste generated by our operations at our landfills, achieving a rate of over 90% solid waste diversion away from landfills in 2015.
And we've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on energy use and renewable energy and by modernizing our fleet with more fuel-efficient vehicles, routing and capacity utilization. In fact, compared to 2006, we've improved the energy efficiency of our legacy operations by 18%.
Taken together, our environmental sustainability initiatives have not only had a significant positive impact on our planet, but they've also contributed to our productivity savings. Over the past 5 years, our sustainability initiatives have generated more than $600 million in savings because we're simply using fewer resources in our businesses. Combining our environmental sustainability savings with those of our other productivity initiatives, we are generating more than $1 billion in annual productivity savings. These savings are both providing fuel for reinvestment in the business and contributing to consistent margin improvement. And we continue to invest and promote initiatives to protect and support the safety, health, professional development and human of our global workforce. This includes promoting women's equal advancement and fostering a diverse and engaging culture that attracts the talent base needed to grow our high-performing business.
We view our sustained top-tier results as a validation of our performance and purposed direction where we are balancing short-term results, while ensuring PepsiCo remains successful for the long term. In the coming weeks, we will issue our annual sustainability report where we will share with you in much more detail our progress and accomplishments under performance and purpose. Just as important, we will layout our sustainable revision and goals for the coming decade and our pledge to make our products more nutritious, our [indiscernible] system more sustainable and our communities more prosperous, in doing so we will pave the way for PepsiCo's continued growth. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

As Indra mentioned, we are pleased with our year-to-date performance. We're seeing a good mix of revenue and productivity within the P&L, driving the top line and margin results mentioned earlier and we continue to exercise strong cash flow management and capital allocation discipline. As a result, in the third quarter, we once again shortened our cash conversion cycle in this case by almost 10 days compared to Q3 of 2015 and we maintained our net capital spending on a rolling 4-quarter basis, well within our target of 5% of net revenue. I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2016 through a combination of $3 billion in share repurchases and $4 billion of dividends. During Q3 with the June payment, we increased our annualized dividends per share by 7%, which marks our 44th consecutive annualized increase.
Looking to the balance of year, as we mentioned, we increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78, which incorporates the following: Underlying core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, excluding the impact of Venezuela; an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from the 2015 Venezuela deconsolidation; and an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus, which is an improvement of approximately 1 percentage point versus our July update. Our outlook on the other metrics we provide remained unchanged from July and are set out in this morning's release. 
For the analysts on the call, as you update your Q4 models, you should consider the following factors: The inclusion of the 53rd week in this fiscal year will benefit our full year revenue results by approximately 1 percentage points, but is not expected to result in any impact to our core earnings per share as we intend to reinvest the benefit back into our business; our Q4 foreign exchange outlook implies a moderation of the headwind as compared to what we have experienced year-to-date but this assumption is obviously subject to macro and geopolitical conditions, which remain quite volatile. Given the timing of our commodity hedges, we faced a difficult year-over-year gross margin expansion comparison in Q4. While we are lapping a large increase in A&M as a percentage of net revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to invest in A&M. And finally, while our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged, we will be lapping an unusually low core effective tax rate from Q4 2015.
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2016 has improved from our last call and we continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation and cash returns to shareholders. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

It looks like much greater SG&A leverage is driving this year, in particular when compared to the prior few years. So albeit with 1 quarter left to go, I guess can you talk about what's driving that greater SG&A leverage, particularly given it looks like A&M will be up again solidly this year? And I'm assuming the answer is productivity, perhaps a bit less on FX but on the productivity side, is the ramp up kind of sustainable versus the past years and how should we think about it going forward? And then on the other hand, on the gross margin side, obviously, very strong expansion in the last few years, it did slow a bit sequentially this quarter I'm assuming with less favorable commodities. But as we look out to Q4 and 2017, perhaps you can give us some guidance around commodities and how that impacts gross margins?"

On the SG&A leverage, it all starts first with top line growth. The minute you get good top line growth, you get leverage on all of the other SG&A costs that we have in the P&L. And so this quarter, was a very, very good top line growth at 4.2, that's pretty significant and that gives us leverage to start with. Couple that with the fact that many of our productivity programs, which we put in place very deliberate, it wasn't a productivity program where we just cut the cost for the sake of cutting the cost. We actually built the underlying capabilities so when we take out the cost, they come out for good. So putting in the ERP systems, putting the right tools to ensure visibility across the company, all of that took some funny. We invested a so that we can take out the cost permanently. And slowly by step-by-step, all of these costs are coming out in a very deliberate and a disciplined way. And so the combination that to gives us the SG&A leverage. The key thing to remember is that over a year or 2 years, the overall P&L looks very well. Quarter-to-quarter, you might have different aspects differently, one quarter might be gross margin, another quarter maybe SG&A leverage. But I think over a long period of time, the P&L seems to be working quite well. Hugh, do you what to add anything to that?"

Regarding North America, price/mix was one, but it was actually a strong one, I think the number was exactly 1 3 and that is as you said a combination of price/mix. We are considering to get good pricing in carbonated soft drinks a couple of factors I would remind you so you're saying it'll because of that pricing flow through retailers as we have inflationary commodities. The other is we do have negative water mix going on. So on the one hand, noncarbs were quite positive, but a portion of that was water, which is obviously from a price/mix perspective, negative. So in total, with the 1 3 of price/mix that we got, along with good productivity, you saw a profit of 10% in the quarter. So we think we've got a very healthy mix of pricing and productivity in that market right now. And frankly, we see nothing but rational pricing going on in the marketplace. Regarding AMENA, a couple of factors there. Number one, we did see some bottlers reducing their concentrated inventories. So the volume number that you see relative to the revenue number is in part driven by the fact that volume is driven by sales and revenue is driven by concentrate shipments. So that the numbers aren't quite as negative as they look in terms of what flows through the balance of the P&L. In addition to that, the pricing was not particularly high in India both investments in the beverage businesses and those were both factors in the numbers for the quarter."

I'm pleased to report our businesses continue to perform well in the third quarter. Specifically, we had more than 3% organic volume growth in global snacks and more than 2% organic volume growth in global beverages. While foreign exchange translation continued to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 4% organic revenue growth, which represents an acceleration from the first half. We generated positive net price realization in total. We set up investments in our brands with A&M up 65 basis points as a percent of net revenue and made incremental marketplace investments. We expanded gross and operating margins. We grew core constant currency operating profit 2% and up 6%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11%, excluding the Venezuela impact. 
Our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue 8% for the quarter with double-digit organic revenue growth in a number of markets, including China, Mexico, Brazil and Egypt. And our developed markets grew organic revenue 3%, led by Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages. Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Core constant currency operating profit grew 5% and up 8%, excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11%, excluding the Venezuela impact.
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78 from our previous target of $4.71, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
In addition to our financial results, we're also delivering on other key performance metrics. Innovation ran at approximately 9% of net revenue in the quarter. Advertising and marketing is up another 60 basis points as a percent of net revenue year-to-date. And execution metrics are improving across the board, driving growth for us and our retail partners. For example, in the third quarter in the U.S., which is our largest market, we were once again the largest contributor to retail food and beverage sales growth. We generated approximately 37% of all food and beverage retail sales growth, significantly higher than our food and beverage dollar share position of less than 10%. And we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. We're on track to deliver $1 billion in productivity savings in 2016, and we're on track to deliver $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items. 
Our results reflect our commitment to Performance with Purpose, PepsiCo's vision to deliver top-tier financial performance over the long term by integrating sustainability into our business strategy. When we launched Performance with Purpose in 2006, we opted not to use sustainability simply through the lens of corporate social responsibility. Instead, we charted a course rooted in the firm belief that in order to meet the changing needs of our consumers, exercise responsible stewardship for environment and create an environment within our company where each employee feels valued and can bring their whole selves to work, we have to transform the way we do business, willing sustainability into the way we make money. A decade into our journey, that belief is being validated and is propelling our company forward as this quarter's financial results demonstrate. 
On the purpose side of Performance with Purpose, our first commitment was human sustainability, transforming our product portfolio with a particular focus on reducing sodium, saturated fat and added sugars, while dialing up on nutrition investments. And we're pleased with the progress we've made.
As compared to 2006, we have reduced the average sodium in our food products by 11% per serving and removed more than 2,300 metric tons of sodium from key global food brands in key countries. We've reduced our average amount of saturated fat per serving by more than 15% in key global brands in a number of our major markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, China and Turkey. And we're making strides to reduce added sugars in our beverages through reformulation. Our transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where we derive approximately 45% of our net revenue from products that we refer to as guilt-free. Those products include Diet and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. And a full 27 points of the 45 points is made up of what we refer to as everyday nutrition, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, protein, unsweetened tea and water. 
And our innovation focus reflects our commitment to portfolio transformation. Just to give you a few examples, recently, we launched Quaker Super Goodness porridge sachets in the U.K. made with whole grain oats, quinoa, barley and flaxseed. And introduced carrot, pineapple, mango Tropicana Farmstand in the U.S. made with 100% fruit and vegetable juices and no added sugar. Sabra, built off the strength of our highly popular hummus, had established a range of authentic products that include guacamole, salsa, baba ghanoush and greek yogurt dips and spreads. Sabra now generates approximately $800 million in estimated annual retail sales in the United States, well on its way to becoming a $1 billion brand.
Our Naked superpremium fruit and vegetable juices and coconut waters are loved by consumers for their great flavor, all-natural ingredients and no added sugars or preservatives. We have doubled Naked's net revenue over the last 6 years and grown estimated annual retail sales to over $1 billion. We recently extended the Naked lineup with the introduction of Naked cold-pressed juices. 
Propel water, by the makers of Gatorade, a 0-calorie sports hydration beverage enriched with electrolytes and minerals, is enjoying renewed success in North America with year-to-date volume up 6%.
We've also successfully expanded what we refer to as our guilt-free product lineup. Pure Leaf Tea is an example, a premium line of ready-to-drink teas, brewed and steamed simply and authentically from leaves picked at their freshest. Since this launch in 2012, Pure Leaf has grown to more than $650 million in estimated annual retail sales. We're now elevating Pure Leaf into a superpremium line under the Tea House Collection. 
Our Baked lineup is another example of how we are transforming our portfolio. Spurred by the success of the Baked! Lay's, we have broadened our Baked lineup to include Baked! Doritos, Baked! Tostitos and Baked! Cheetos and have expanded the lineup to 9 international markets where there's a lot of opportunity for further growth and market expansion. 
And we recently launched Stubborn Soda, a new generation premium crafted sparkling beverage that is just 90 to 100 calories per 12 ounces and is made with Fair Trade Certified cane sugar and stevia with no high fructose corn syrup.
So it's the breadth of our evolving product portfolio and our ability to innovate against it that enables us to generate consistent organic revenue growth. 
Likewise under Performance with Purpose, our environmental sustainability agenda had positive impacts, both in our business results and more broadly on the planet we share. By using fewer resources, water, packaging and energy, we are simultaneously shrinking our environmental footprint and reducing our operating costs. We improved our water stewardship by adopting new technologies and processes, which have steadily reduced our water use per unit of production, and we've implemented integrated watershed management in water-stressed and water-scarce areas. As a result, today, we're using approximately 25% less water per unit of production than we did when we embarked on Performance with Purpose. In addition, we have supported growers in our value chain and their pursuits of better water use management. And through the PepsiCo Foundation, we have successfully partnered to provide access to safe water for more than 9 million people globally.
We're also using less packaging and generating less landfill waste. We have successfully reduced packaging weight and size and increased post-consumer recycled content in our packaging. While reducing packaging weight and size, we removed almost 100 million pounds of packaging materials from the market in 2015 alone. We have worked to increase the recycling rates of beverage containers among consumers, and we have significantly reduced the amount of solid waste generated by our operations that are sent to landfills, achieving a rate of over 90% solid waste diversion away from landfills in 2015.
And we've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on energy use and renewable energy and by modernizing our fleet with more fuel-efficient vehicles, routing and capacity utilization. In fact, compared to 2006, we've improved the energy efficiency of our legacy operations by 18%.
Taken together, our environmental sustainability initiatives have not only had a significant positive impact on our planet, but they've also contributed to our productivity savings. Over the past 5 years, our sustainability initiatives have generated more than $600 million in savings because we're simply using fewer resources in our businesses. Combining our environmental sustainability savings with those of our other productivity initiatives, we are generating more than $1 billion in annual productivity savings. These savings are both providing fuel for reinvestment in the business and contributing to consistent margin improvement. And we continue to invest and then promote initiatives to protect and support the safety, health, professional development and human rights of our global workforce. This includes promoting women's equal advancement and fostering a diverse and engaging culture that attracts the talent base needed to grow our high-performing business.
We view our sustained top-tier results as a validation of our Performance with Purpose direction, where we are balancing short-term results while ensuring PepsiCo remains successful for the long term. In the coming weeks, we will issue our annual sustainability report, where we will share with you in much more detail our progress and accomplishments under Performance with Purpose. Just as important, we will lay out our sustainability vision and goals for the coming decade and our pledge to make our products more nutritious, our food system more sustainable and our communities more prosperous. In doing so, we will pave the way for PepsiCo's continued growth. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

As Indra mentioned, we are pleased with our year-to-date performance. We're seeing a good mix of revenue and productivity within the P&L, driving the top line and margin results mentioned earlier, and we continue to exercise strong cash flow management and capital allocation discipline. As a result, in the third quarter, we once again shortened our cash conversion cycle, in this case by almost 10 days compared to Q3 of 2015, and we maintained our net capital spending on a rolling 4-quarter basis well within our target of 5% of net revenue. I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2016 through a combination of $3 billion in share repurchases and $4 billion of dividends. During Q3 with the June payment, we increased our annualized dividends per share by 7%, which marks our 44th consecutive annualized increase.
Looking to the balance of year, as we mentioned, we increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, excluding the impact of Venezuela; an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from the 2015 Venezuela deconsolidation; and an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus, which is an improvement of approximately 1 percentage point versus our July update. Our outlook on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged from July and are set out in this morning's release. 
For the analysts on the call, as you update your Q4 models, you should consider the following factors: the inclusion of the 53rd week in this fiscal year will benefit our full year revenue results by approximately 1 percentage point but is not expected to result in any impact to our core earnings per share as we intend to reinvest the benefit back into our business; our Q4 foreign exchange outlook implies a moderation of the headwind as compared to what we have experienced year-to-date, but this assumption is obviously subject to macro and geopolitical conditions, which remain quite volatile. Given the timing of our commodity hedges, we face a difficult year-over-year gross margin expansion comparison in Q4. While we are lapping a large increase in A&M spending as a percentage of net revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to invest in A&M. And finally, while our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged, we will be lapping an unusually low core effective tax rate from Q4 2015.
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2016 has improved from our last call and we continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation and cash returns to shareholders. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

It looks like much greater SG&A leverage is driving this year, in particular when compared to the prior few years. So albeit with 1 quarter left to go, I guess can you talk about what's driving that greater SG&A leverage, particularly given it looks like A&M will be up again solidly this year? And I'm assuming the answer is productivity, perhaps a bit less onerous FX, but on the productivity side, is the ramp-up kind of sustainable versus the past years? And how should we think about it going forward? And then on the other hand, on the gross margin side, obviously, very strong expansion in the last few years. It did slow a bit sequentially this quarter, I'm assuming, with less favorable commodities. But as we look out to Q4 and 2017, perhaps you can give us some guidance around commodities and how that impacts gross margins."

On the SG&A leverage, it all starts first with top line growth. The minute you get good top line growth, you get leverage on all of the other SG&A costs that we have in the P&L. And so this quarter was a very, very good top line growth at 4.2%. That's pretty significant and that gives us leverage to start with. Couple that with the fact that many of our productivity programs, which we put in place very deliberate, it wasn't a productivity program where we just cut the cost for the sake of cutting the cost. We actually built the underlying capabilities so when we take out the costs, they come out for good. So putting in the ERP systems, putting the right tools to ensure visibility across the company, all of that took some money. We invested so that we could take out the costs permanently. And slowly by -- step-by-step, all of these costs are coming out in a very deliberate and a disciplined way. And so the combination of the 2 gives us the SG&A leverage. The key thing to remember is that over a year or 2 years, the overall P&L works very well. Quarter-to-quarter, you might have different aspects of the P&L delivering differently. 1 quarter, it might be gross margin, another quarter might be SG&A leverage. But I think over a long period of time, the P&L seems to be working quite well. Hugh, do you want to add anything to that?"

Two small items that I would add that I think are worth mentioning. Number one, the investments we've made in technology are not just making our selling system more productive by putting not just handhelds in the hands of our route salesmen, but actually putting iPads in the hands of our district managers, enabling them to be more effective and to manage more basically with the same or less resources. And the same is true of management more broadly in the G&A bucket. By virtue of leveraging the technology advancements that are out there, we're making our management, frankly, more productive and that's enabled us to do more with less. The other item that I would point to is we implemented Smart Spending really late last year and into this year, and we are seeing the benefits of that. Whether it's across travel or consultants or facilities, we have gotten smarter with our spending and as a result, you're seeing flow-through of that productivity into margin improvement."

The Pacific Rim, good economies, all from -- all the entire ASEAN world, if you want to put it that way. India is looking good. Even China is looking much better than it did in the early part of the year. I'm just talking overall economic, not just our business. Then if you come over to Europe, Russia, clearly, we are seeing signs of improvement and this is even before the oil prices started to stabilize and improve. East Europe still looks all right. Western Europe is not getting worse so that's a good sign. And when you come to Latin America, look, we have good businesses there. And there's no question Argentina had a troubled year, Brazil is having its share of troubles. But I'd say that overall, the economy seemed to be holding up, but more importantly, our businesses seemed to be performing quite well because retailers turn to us to deliver more of the growth because we have high-velocity categories and we take labor off the store through our DSD systems. So I think retailers are turning more and more to us to deliver a lot of the growth. Overall, I'd say cautiously optimistic about emerging and developing markets."

Negative price/mix in AMENA continues, arguably getting a little bit worse, given easier compares. So just on those 2, would love to get a sense of that.

I think the number was exactly 1.3% and that is, as you said, a combination of price/mix. We are continuing to get good pricing in carbonated soft drinks. The couple of factors I would remind you of is you do have deflationary commodities right now so you're seeing a little bit less of that pricing flow through into retailers as we have deflationary commodities. The other is we do have negative water mix going on. So on the one hand, non-carbs were quite positive, but a portion of that was water, which is obviously from a price/mix perspective, negative. So in total, with the 1.3% of price/mix that we got, along with good productivity, you saw a profit of 10% in the quarter. So we think we've got a very healthy mix of pricing and productivity in that market right now. And frankly, we see nothing but rational pricing going on in the marketplace. Regarding AMENA, a couple of factors there. Number one, we did see some bottlers reducing their concentrate inventories. So the volume number that you see relative to the revenue number is in part driven by the fact that volume is driven by bottle case sales and revenue is driven by concentrate shipments. So that the numbers aren't quite as negative as they look in terms of what flows through the balance of the P&L. In addition to that, the pricing was not particularly high in India, both in the snacks and in the beverage businesses, and those were both factors in the numbers for the quarter."

We want to play the total beverage portfolio because we want to make sure that we go where the consumer is going. So teas are up. Coffee is doing well. Hydration is doing well. Products like Kickstart, which are sort of soft energy products, I'd say, are doing well. I think overall, the category is doing -- our business is doing quite well and we are gaining LRB share, which is really our focus. Lastly, foodservice is doing well. It's an area that we underperformed in many years ago with the bottlers coming back and we've reinvested in foodservice and that's growing, too.

The big drivers were just flow-through off of that productivity to deliver the positive margin result, while at the same time investing significantly more money in advertising and marketing to drive all of the product innovation that's enabling the top line.

But I'd say on balance, it's plus or minus 1% around -- in terms of emerging, developing and developed markets and then beverages and snacks.
So thank you all for your questions. In closing, let me just say that we are confident we have the right strategies in place and we are executing very well. We are pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date. We're on track to deliver our targets for the year, and we look forward to sharing with you our sustainability vision and goals for the coming decade and the weeks ahead. And as always, thank you for the trust you've placed in us with your investment. We remain absolutely committed to increasing its value. Thank you."

I'm pleased to report our businesses continue to perform well in the third quarter. Specifically, we had more than 3% organic volume growth in global snacks and more than 2% organic volume growth in global beverages. While foreign exchange translation continued to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 4% organic revenue growth, which represents an acceleration from the first half. We generated positive net price realization in total. We stepped up investment in our brands, with A&M up 65 basis points as a percent of net revenue, and made incremental marketplace investments. We expanded gross and operating margins. We grew core constant currency operating profit 2% and up 6% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the Venezuela impact. 
Our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue 8% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in a number of markets, including China, Mexico, Brazil and Egypt. And our developed markets grew organic revenue 3%, led by Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages. Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Core constant currency operating profit grew 5% and up 8% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the Venezuela impact.
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78 from our previous target of $4.71, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
In addition to our financial results, we're also delivering on other key performance metrics. Innovation ran at approximately 9% of net revenue in the quarter. Advertising and marketing is up another 60 basis points as a percent of net revenue year-to-date. And execution metrics are improving across the board, driving growth for us and our retail partners. For example, in the third quarter in the U.S., which is our largest market, we were once again the largest contributor to retail food and beverage sales growth. We generated approximately 37% of all food and beverage retail sales growth, significantly higher than our food and beverage dollar share position of less than 10%. And we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. We're on track to deliver $1 billion in productivity savings in 2016, and we're on track to deliver $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items. 
Our results reflect our commitment to Performance with Purpose, PepsiCo's vision to deliver top-tier financial performance over the long term by integrating sustainability into our business strategy. When we launched Performance with Purpose in 2006, we opted not to view sustainability simply through the lens of corporate social responsibility. Instead, we charted a course rooted in the firm belief that in order to meet the changing needs of our consumers, exercise responsible stewardship for environment and create an environment within our company where each employee feels valued and can bring their whole selves to work, we had to transform the way we do business, weaving sustainability into the way we make money. A decade into our journey, that belief is being validated and is propelling our company forward as this quarter's financial results demonstrate. 
On the purpose side of Performance with Purpose, our first commitment was human sustainability, transforming our product portfolio with a particular focus on reducing sodium, saturated fat and added sugars, while dialing up our nutrition investments. And we're pleased with the progress we've made.
As compared to 2006, we have reduced the average sodium in our food products by 11% per serving and removed more than 2,300 metric tons of sodium from key global food brands in key countries. We have reduced the average amount of saturated fat per serving by more than 15% in key global brands in a number of our major markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, China and Turkey. And we're making strides to reduce added sugars in our beverages through reformulation. Our transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where we derive approximately 45% of our net revenue from products that we refer to as guilt-free. Those products include Diet and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. And a full 27 points of the 45 points is made up of what we refer to as everyday nutrition, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, protein, unsweetened tea and water. 
And our innovation focus reflects our commitment to portfolio transformation. Just to give you a few examples: Recently, we launched Quaker Super Goodness porridge sachets in the U.K. made with whole grain oats, quinoa, barley and flaxseed; and introduced carrot, pineapple, mango Tropicana Farmstand in the U.S. made with 100% fruit and vegetable juices and no added sugar. Sabra, built off the strength of our highly popular hummus, has established a range of authentic products that include guacamole, salsa, baba ghanoush and Greek yogurt dips and spreads. Sabra now generates approximately $800 million in estimated annual retail sales in the United States, well on its way to becoming a $1 billion brand.
Our Naked superpremium fruit and vegetable juices and coconut waters are loved by consumers for their great flavor, all-natural ingredients and no added sugars or preservatives. We have doubled Naked's net revenue over the last 6 years and grown estimated annual retail sales to over $1 billion. We recently extended the Naked lineup with the introduction of Naked cold-pressed juices. 
Propel water, by the makers of Gatorade, a 0-calorie sports hydration beverage enriched with electrolytes and minerals, is enjoying renewed success in North America, with year-to-date volume up 6%.
We've also successfully expanded what we refer to as our guilt-free product lineup. Pure Leaf Tea is an example, a premium line of ready-to-drink teas, brewed and steeped simply and authentically from leaves picked at their freshest. Since its launch in 2012, Pure Leaf has grown to more than $650 million in estimated annual retail sales. We're now elevating Pure Leaf into a superpremium line under the Tea House Collection. 
Our Baked lineup is another example of how we are transforming our portfolio. Spurred by the success of Baked! Lay's, we have broadened our Baked lineup to include Baked! Doritos, Baked! Tostitos and Baked! Cheetos and have expanded the lineup to 9 international markets where there's a lot of opportunity for further growth and market expansion. 
And we recently launched Stubborn Soda, a new generation premium crafted sparkling beverage that is just 90 to 100 calories per 12 ounces and is made with Fair Trade Certified cane sugar and stevia, with no high fructose corn syrup.
So it's the breadth of our evolving product portfolio and our ability to innovate against it that enables us to generate consistent organic revenue growth. 
Likewise under Performance with Purpose, our environmental sustainability agenda has had positive impacts, both in our business results and more broadly on the planet we share. By using fewer resources, water, packaging and energy, we are simultaneously shrinking our environmental footprint and reducing our operating costs. We improved our water stewardship by adopting new technologies and processes which have steadily reduced our water use per unit of production, and we've implemented integrated watershed management in water-stressed and water-scarce areas. As a result, today, we're using approximately 25% less water per unit of production than we did when we embarked on Performance with Purpose. In addition, we have supported growers in our value chain and their pursuits of better water use management. And through the PepsiCo Foundation, we have successfully partnered to provide access to safe water for more than 9 million people globally.
We're also using less packaging and generating less landfill waste. We have successfully reduced packaging weight and size and increased post-consumer recycled content in our packaging. By reducing packaging weight and size, we removed almost 100 million pounds of packaging materials from the market in 2015 alone. We have worked to increase the recycling rates of beverage containers among consumers, and we have significantly reduced the amount of solid waste generated by our operations that are sent to landfills, achieving a rate of over 90% solid waste diversion away from landfills in 2015.
And we've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on energy use and renewable energy and by modernizing our fleet with more fuel-efficient vehicles, routing and capacity utilization. In fact, compared to 2006, we've improved the energy efficiency of our legacy operations by 18%.
Taken together, our environmental sustainability initiatives have not only had a significant positive impact on our planet, but they've also contributed to our productivity savings. Over the past 5 years, our sustainability initiatives have generated more than $600 million in savings because we're simply using fewer resources in our businesses. Combining our environmental sustainability savings with those of our other productivity initiatives, we are generating more than $1 billion in annual productivity savings. These savings are both providing fuel for reinvestment in the business and contributing to consistent margin improvement. And we continue to invest in and promote initiatives to protect and support the safety, health, professional development and human rights of our global workforce. This includes promoting women's equal advancement and fostering a diverse and engaging culture that attracts the talent base needed to grow our high-performing business.
We view our sustained top-tier results as a validation of our Performance with Purpose direction, where we are balancing short-term results while ensuring PepsiCo remains successful for the long term. In the coming weeks, we will issue our annual sustainability report, where we will share with you in much more detail our progress and accomplishments under Performance with Purpose. Just as important, we will lay out our sustainability vision and goals for the coming decade and our pledge to make our products more nutritious, our food system more sustainable and our communities more prosperous. In doing so, we will pave the way for PepsiCo's continued growth. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

As Indra mentioned, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance. We're seeing a good mix of revenue and productivity within the P&L, driving the top line and margin results mentioned earlier, and we continue to exercise strong cash flow management and capital allocation discipline. As a result, in the third quarter, we once again shortened our cash conversion cycle, in this case by almost 10 days compared to Q3 of 2015, and we maintained our net capital spending on a rolling 4-quarter basis, well within our target of 5% of net revenue. I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2016 through a combination of $3 billion in share repurchases and $4 billion of dividends. During Q3 with the June payment, we increased our annualized dividends per share by 7%, which marks our 44th consecutive annualized increase.
Looking to the balance of year, as we mentioned, we increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, excluding the impact of Venezuela; an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from the 2015 Venezuela deconsolidation; and an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus, which is an improvement of approximately 1 percentage point versus our July update. Our outlook on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged from July and are set out in this morning's release. 
For the analysts on the call, as you update your Q4 models, you should consider the following factors: the inclusion of the 53rd week in this fiscal year will benefit our full year revenue results by approximately 1 percentage point but is not expected to result in any impact to our core earnings per share as we intend to reinvest the benefit back into our business; our Q4 foreign exchange outlook implies a moderation of the headwind as compared to what we have experienced year-to-date, but this assumption is obviously subject to macro and geopolitical conditions, which remain quite volatile. Given the timing of our commodity hedges, we face a difficult year-over-year gross margin expansion comparison in Q4. While we are lapping a large increase in A&M spending as a percentage of net revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to invest in A&M. And finally, while our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged, we will be lapping an unusually low core effective tax rate from Q4 2015.
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2016 has improved from our last call and we continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation and cash returns to shareholders. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

It looks like much greater SG&A leverage is driving this year, in particular, when compared to the prior few years. So albeit with 1 quarter left to go, I guess can you talk about what's driving that greater SG&A leverage, particularly given it looks like A&M will be up again solidly this year? And I'm assuming the answer is productivity, perhaps a bit less onerous FX, but on the productivity side, is the ramp-up kind of sustainable versus the past years? And how should we think about it going forward? And then on the other hand, on the gross margin side, obviously, very strong expansion in the last few years. It did slow a bit sequentially this quarter, I'm assuming with less favorable commodities. But as we look out to Q4 and 2017, perhaps you can give us some guidance around commodities and how that impacts gross margins."

On the SG&A leverage, it all starts first with top line growth. The minute you get good top line growth, you get leverage on all of the other SG&A costs that we have in the P&L. And so this quarter was a very, very good top line growth at 4.2%. That's pretty significant and that gives us leverage to start with. Couple that with the fact that many of our productivity programs, which we put in place very deliberately, it wasn't a productivity program where we just cut the cost for the sake of cutting the cost. We actually built the underlying capabilities so when we take out the costs, they come out for good. So putting in the ERP systems, putting the right tools to ensure visibility across the company, all of that took some money. We invested so that we could take out the costs permanently. And slowly, by -- step-by-step, all of these costs are coming out in a very deliberate and a disciplined way. And so the combination of the 2 gives us the SG&A leverage. The key thing to remember is that over 1 year or 2 years, the overall P&L works very well. Quarter-to-quarter, you might have different aspects of the P&L delivering differently. One quarter, it might be gross margin, another quarter might be SG&A leverage. But I think over a long period of time, the P&L seems to be working quite well. Hugh, do you want to add anything to that?"

Two small items that I would add that I think are worth mentioning. Number one, the investments we've made in technology are not just making our selling system more productive by putting not just handhelds in the hands of our route salesmen, but actually putting iPads in the hands of our district managers, enabling them to be more effective and to manage more basically with the same or less resources. And the same is true of management more broadly in the G&A bucket. By virtue of leveraging the technology advancements that are out there, we're making our management, frankly, more productive and that's enabled us to do more with less. The other item that I would point to is we implemented Smart Spending really late last year and into this year, and we are seeing the benefits of that. Whether it's across travel or consultants or facilities, we have gotten smarter with our spending and as a result, you're seeing flow-through of that productivity into margin improvement."

Even China is looking much better than it did in the early part of the year. I'm just talking overall economic, not just our business. Then if you come over to Europe, Russia, clearly, we are seeing signs of improvement and this is even before the oil prices started to stabilize and improve. East Europe still looks all right. Western Europe is not getting worse, so that's a good sign. And when you come to Latin America, look, we have good businesses there. And there's no question Argentina had a troubled year, Brazil is having its share of troubles. But I'd say that overall, the economy seemed to be holding up, but more importantly, our businesses seemed to be performing quite well because retailers turn to us to deliver more of the growth because we have high-velocity categories and we take labor off the store through our DSD systems.

I think the number was exactly 1.3 and that is, as you said, a combination of price mix. We are continuing to get good pricing in carbonated soft drinks. The couple of factors I would remind you of is we do have deflationary commodities right now, so you're seeing a little bit less of that pricing flow through into retailers as we have deflationary commodities. The other is we do have negative water mix going on. So on the one hand, non-carbs were quite positive, but a portion of that was water, which is obviously from a price mix perspective, negative. So in total, with the 1.3 of price mix that we got, along with good productivity, you saw a profit of 10% in the quarter. So we think we've got a very healthy mix of pricing and productivity in that market right now. And frankly, we see nothing but rational pricing going on in the marketplace. Regarding AMENA, a couple of factors there. Number one, we did see some bottlers reducing their concentrate inventories. So the volume number that you see relative to the revenue number is in part driven by the fact that volume is driven by bottle case sales and revenue is driven by concentrate shipments. So that the numbers aren't quite as negative as they look in terms of what flows through the balance of the P&L.

All of those together did drive the growth of all beverages and definitely Gatorade. As far as the rest of the categories go, we are playing the long game. We want to play the total beverage portfolio because we want to make sure that we go where the consumer is going. So teas are up. Coffee is doing well. Hydration is doing well. Products like Kickstart, which are sort of soft energy products, I'd say, are doing well. I think overall, the category is doing -- our business is doing quite well and we are gaining LRB share, which is really our focus. Lastly, foodservice is doing well. It's an area that we underperformed in many years ago with the bottlers coming back and we've reinvested in foodservice and that's growing, too. So overall, I'd say innovation, incredible focus on execution, followed by productivity, all 3 are delivering good results in NAB."

The big drivers were just flow-through off of that productivity to deliver the positive margin result, while at the same time investing significantly more money in advertising and marketing to drive all of the product innovation that's enabling the top line.

I'm pleased to report our businesses continue to perform well in the third quarter. Specifically, we had more than 3% organic volume growth in global snacks and more than 2% organic volume growth in global beverages. While foreign exchange translation continued to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 4% organic revenue growth, which represents an acceleration from the first half. We generated positive net price realization in total. We stepped up investment in our brands, with A&M up 65 basis points as a percent of net revenue, and made incremental marketplace investments. We expanded gross and operating margins. We grew core constant currency operating profit 2% and up 6% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the Venezuela impact. 
Our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue 8% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in a number of markets, including China, Mexico, Brazil and Egypt. And our developed markets grew organic revenue 3%, led by Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages. Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Core constant currency operating profit grew 5% and up 8% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the Venezuela impact.
On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78 from our previous target of $4.71, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning's press release. 
In addition to our financial results, we're also delivering on other key performance metrics. Innovation ran at approximately 9% of net revenue in the quarter. Advertising and marketing is up another 60 basis points as a percent of net revenue year-to-date. And execution metrics are improving across the board, driving growth for us and our retail partners. For example, in the third quarter in the U.S., which is our largest market, we were once again the largest contributor to retail food and beverage sales growth. We generated approximately 37% of all food and beverage retail sales growth, significantly higher than our food and beverage dollar share position of less than 10%. And we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. We're on track to deliver $1 billion in productivity savings in 2016, and we're on track to deliver $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items. 
Our results reflect our commitment to Performance with Purpose, PepsiCo's vision to deliver top-tier financial performance over the long term by integrating sustainability into our business strategy. When we launched Performance with Purpose in 2006, we opted not to view sustainability simply through the lens of corporate social responsibility. Instead, we charted a course rooted in the firm belief that in order to meet the changing needs of our consumers, exercise responsible stewardship for environment and create an environment within our company where each employee feels valued and can bring their whole selves to work, we had to transform the way we do business, weaving sustainability into the way we make money. A decade into our journey, that belief is being validated and is propelling our company forward as this quarter's financial results demonstrate. 
On the purpose side of Performance with Purpose, our first commitment was human sustainability, transforming our product portfolio with a particular focus on reducing sodium, saturated fat and added sugars, while dialing up our nutrition investments. And we're pleased with the progress we've made.
As compared to 2006, we have reduced the average sodium in our food products by 11% per serving and removed more than 2,300 metric tons of sodium from key global food brands in key countries. We have reduced the average amount of saturated fat per serving by more than 15% in key global brands in a number of our major markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, China and Turkey. And we're making strides to reduce added sugars in our beverages through reformulation. Our transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where we derive approximately 45% of our net revenue from products that we refer to as guilt-free. Those products include Diet and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. And a full 27 points of the 45 points is made up of what we refer to as everyday nutrition, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, protein, unsweetened tea and water. 
And our innovation focus reflects our commitment to portfolio transformation. Just to give you a few examples: Recently, we launched Quaker Super Goodness porridge sachets in the U.K. made with whole grain oats, quinoa, barley and flaxseed; and introduced carrot, pineapple, mango Tropicana Farmstand in the U.S. made with 100% fruit and vegetable juices and no added sugar. Sabra, built off the strength of our highly popular hummus, has established a range of authentic products that include guacamole, salsa, baba ghanoush and Greek yogurt dips and spreads. Sabra now generates approximately $800 million in estimated annual retail sales in the United States, well on its way to becoming a $1 billion brand.
Our Naked superpremium fruit and vegetable juices and coconut waters are loved by consumers for their great flavor, all-natural ingredients and no added sugars or preservatives. We have doubled Naked's net revenue over the last 6 years and grown estimated annual retail sales to over $1 billion. We recently extended the Naked lineup with the introduction of Naked cold-pressed juices. 
Propel water, by the makers of Gatorade, a 0-calorie sports hydration beverage enriched with electrolytes and minerals, is enjoying renewed success in North America, with year-to-date volume up 6%.
We've also successfully expanded what we refer to as our guilt-free product lineup. Pure Leaf Tea is an example, a premium line of ready-to-drink teas, brewed and steeped simply and authentically from leaves picked at their freshest. Since its launch in 2012, Pure Leaf has grown to more than $650 million in estimated annual retail sales. We're now elevating Pure Leaf into a superpremium line under the Tea House Collection. 
Our Baked lineup is another example of how we are transforming our portfolio. Spurred by the success of Baked! Lay's, we have broadened our Baked lineup to include Baked! Doritos, Baked! Tostitos and Baked! Cheetos and have expanded the lineup to 9 international markets where there's a lot of opportunity for further growth and market expansion. 
And we recently launched Stubborn Soda, a new generation premium crafted sparkling beverage that is just 90 to 100 calories per 12 ounces and is made with Fair Trade Certified cane sugar and stevia, with no high fructose corn syrup.
So it's the breadth of our evolving product portfolio and our ability to innovate against it that enables us to generate consistent organic revenue growth. 
Likewise under Performance with Purpose, our environmental sustainability agenda has had positive impacts, both in our business results and more broadly on the planet we share. By using fewer resources, water, packaging and energy, we are simultaneously shrinking our environmental footprint and reducing our operating costs. We improved our water stewardship by adopting new technologies and processes which have steadily reduced our water use per unit of production, and we've implemented integrated watershed management in water-stressed and water-scarce areas. As a result, today, we're using approximately 25% less water per unit of production than we did when we embarked on Performance with Purpose. In addition, we have supported growers in our value chain and their pursuits of better water use management. And through the PepsiCo Foundation, we have successfully partnered to provide access to safe water for more than 9 million people globally.
We're also using less packaging and generating less landfill waste. We have successfully reduced packaging weight and size and increased post-consumer recycled content in our packaging. By reducing packaging weight and size, we removed almost 100 million pounds of packaging materials from the market in 2015 alone. We have worked to increase the recycling rates of beverage containers among consumers, and we have significantly reduced the amount of solid waste generated by our operations that are sent to landfills, achieving a rate of over 90% solid waste diversion away from landfills in 2015.
And we've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on energy use and renewable energy and by modernizing our fleet with more fuel-efficient vehicles, routing and capacity utilization. In fact, compared to 2006, we've improved the energy efficiency of our legacy operations by 18%.
Taken together, our environmental sustainability initiatives have not only had a significant positive impact on our planet, but they've also contributed to our productivity savings. Over the past 5 years, our sustainability initiatives have generated more than $600 million in savings because we're simply using fewer resources in our businesses. Combining our environmental sustainability savings with those of our other productivity initiatives, we are generating more than $1 billion in annual productivity savings. These savings are both providing fuel for reinvestment in the business and contributing to consistent margin improvement. And we continue to invest in and promote initiatives to protect and support the safety, health, professional development and human rights of our global workforce. This includes promoting women's equal advancement and fostering a diverse and engaging culture that attracts the talent base needed to grow our high-performing business.
We view our sustained top-tier results as a validation of our Performance with Purpose direction, where we are balancing short-term results while ensuring PepsiCo remains successful for the long term. In the coming weeks, we will issue our annual sustainability report, where we will share with you in much more detail our progress and accomplishments under Performance with Purpose. Just as important, we will lay out our sustainability vision and goals for the coming decade and our pledge to make our products more nutritious, our food system more sustainable and our communities more prosperous. In doing so, we will pave the way for PepsiCo's continued growth. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

As Indra mentioned, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance. We're seeing a good mix of revenue and productivity within the P&L, driving the top line and margin results mentioned earlier, and we continue to exercise strong cash flow management and capital allocation discipline. As a result, in the third quarter, we once again shortened our cash conversion cycle, in this case by almost 10 days compared to Q3 of 2015, and we maintained our net capital spending on a rolling 4-quarter basis, well within our target of 5% of net revenue. I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2016 through a combination of $3 billion in share repurchases and $4 billion of dividends. During Q3 with the June payment, we increased our annualized dividends per share by 7%, which marks our 44th consecutive annualized increase.
Looking to the balance of year, as we mentioned, we increased our full year core EPS target to $4.78, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, excluding the impact of Venezuela; an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from the 2015 Venezuela deconsolidation; and an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus, which is an improvement of approximately 1 percentage point versus our July update. Our outlook on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged from July and are set out in this morning's release. 
For the analysts on the call, as you update your Q4 models, you should consider the following factors: the inclusion of the 53rd week in this fiscal year will benefit our full year revenue results by approximately 1 percentage point but is not expected to result in any impact to our core earnings per share as we intend to reinvest the benefit back into our business; our Q4 foreign exchange outlook implies a moderation of the headwind as compared to what we have experienced year-to-date, but this assumption is obviously subject to macro and geopolitical conditions, which remain quite volatile. Given the timing of our commodity hedges, we face a difficult year-over-year gross margin expansion comparison in Q4. While we are lapping a large increase in A&M spending as a percentage of net revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to invest in A&M. And finally, while our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged, we will be lapping an unusually low core effective tax rate from Q4 2015.
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2016 has improved from our last call and we continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation and cash returns to shareholders. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

It looks like much greater SG&A leverage is driving this year, in particular, when compared to the prior few years. So albeit with 1 quarter left to go, I guess can you talk about what's driving that greater SG&A leverage, particularly given it looks like A&M will be up again solidly this year? And I'm assuming the answer is productivity, perhaps a bit less onerous FX, but on the productivity side, is the ramp-up kind of sustainable versus the past years? And how should we think about it going forward? And then on the other hand, on the gross margin side, obviously, very strong expansion in the last few years. It did slow a bit sequentially this quarter, I'm assuming with less favorable commodities. But as we look out to Q4 and 2017, perhaps you can give us some guidance around commodities and how that impacts gross margins."

On the SG&A leverage, it all starts first with top line growth. The minute you get good top line growth, you get leverage on all of the other SG&A costs that we have in the P&L. And so this quarter was a very, very good top line growth at 4.2%. That's pretty significant and that gives us leverage to start with. Couple that with the fact that many of our productivity programs, which we put in place very deliberately, it wasn't a productivity program where we just cut the cost for the sake of cutting the cost. We actually built the underlying capabilities so when we take out the costs, they come out for good. So putting in the ERP systems, putting the right tools to ensure visibility across the company, all of that took some money. We invested so that we could take out the costs permanently. And slowly, by -- step-by-step, all of these costs are coming out in a very deliberate and a disciplined way. And so the combination of the 2 gives us the SG&A leverage. The key thing to remember is that over 1 year or 2 years, the overall P&L works very well. Quarter-to-quarter, you might have different aspects of the P&L delivering differently. One quarter, it might be gross margin, another quarter might be SG&A leverage. But I think over a long period of time, the P&L seems to be working quite well. Hugh, do you want to add anything to that?"

Two small items that I would add that I think are worth mentioning. Number one, the investments we've made in technology are not just making our selling system more productive by putting not just handhelds in the hands of our route salesmen, but actually putting iPads in the hands of our district managers, enabling them to be more effective and to manage more basically with the same or less resources. And the same is true of management more broadly in the G&A bucket. By virtue of leveraging the technology advancements that are out there, we're making our management, frankly, more productive and that's enabled us to do more with less. The other item that I would point to is we implemented Smart Spending really late last year and into this year, and we are seeing the benefits of that. Whether it's across travel or consultants or facilities, we have gotten smarter with our spending and as a result, you're seeing flow-through of that productivity into margin improvement."

Even China is looking much better than it did in the early part of the year. I'm just talking overall economic, not just our business. Then if you come over to Europe, Russia, clearly, we are seeing signs of improvement and this is even before the oil prices started to stabilize and improve. East Europe still looks all right. Western Europe is not getting worse, so that's a good sign. And when you come to Latin America, look, we have good businesses there. And there's no question Argentina had a troubled year, Brazil is having its share of troubles. But I'd say that overall, the economy seemed to be holding up, but more importantly, our businesses seemed to be performing quite well because retailers turn to us to deliver more of the growth because we have high-velocity categories and we take labor off the store through our DSD systems. So I think retailers are turning more and more to us to deliver a lot of the growth. Overall, I'd say cautiously optimistic about emerging and developing markets."

Negative price mix in AMENA continues, arguably getting a little bit worse, given the easier compares. So just on those 2, would love to get a sense of that. And then separately on bottling, I guess it's sort of related, I guess, but on bottling, would love to get a sense of how you're thinking about the right structure from a bottling perspective, given ABI-SAB got approved.

I think the number was exactly 1.3 and that is, as you said, a combination of price mix. We are continuing to get good pricing in carbonated soft drinks. The couple of factors I would remind you of is we do have deflationary commodities right now, so you're seeing a little bit less of that pricing flow through into retailers as we have deflationary commodities. The other is we do have negative water mix going on. So on the one hand, non-carbs were quite positive, but a portion of that was water, which is obviously from a price mix perspective, negative. So in total, with the 1.3 of price mix that we got, along with good productivity, you saw a profit of 10% in the quarter. So we think we've got a very healthy mix of pricing and productivity in that market right now. And frankly, we see nothing but rational pricing going on in the marketplace. Regarding AMENA, a couple of factors there. Number one, we did see some bottlers reducing their concentrate inventories. So the volume number that you see relative to the revenue number is in part driven by the fact that volume is driven by bottle case sales and revenue is driven by concentrate shipments. So that the numbers aren't quite as negative as they look in terms of what flows through the balance of the P&L. In addition to that, the pricing was not particularly high in India, both in the snacks and in the beverage businesses, and those were both factors in the numbers for the quarter."

Products like Kickstart, which are sort of soft energy products, I'd say, are doing well. I think overall, the category is doing -- our business is doing quite well and we are gaining LRB share, which is really our focus. Lastly, foodservice is doing well.

The big drivers were just flow-through off of that productivity to deliver the positive margin result, while at the same time investing significantly more money in advertising and marketing to drive all of the product innovation that's enabling the top line.
