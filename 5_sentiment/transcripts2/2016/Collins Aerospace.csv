603843,320077236,920269,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. If you recall on last quarter's earnings call, we said that we expected the first half of fiscal year '16 to be a slow start to the year followed by growth in the second half. We expected the first quarter to be t",1094,"Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. If you recall on last quarter's earnings call, we said that we expected the first half of fiscal year '16 to be a slow start to the year followed by growth in the second half. We expected the first quarter to be the weakest and in fact it was even a little weaker than we anticipated, most notably, in government systems. So let me take that head-on and summarize the performance and outlook of each of the businesses and I'll start with our Government Systems business. 
Due to program timing, we have expected our Government Systems business to be down mid-single digits in the first half followed by nice growth in the second half resulting in overall low single-digit growth for the year. In the first quarter, we did experience the anticipated headwinds that we outlined on last quarter's earnings call. However, we were also impacted by 2 issues that we did not anticipate. 1 was a supplier issue that impacted late quarter deliveries of some products and the other was a delay in some expected follow-on orders. All in the supplier issue and order timing delay caused about a 500 basis point impact to our Government Systems for the quarter. The good news is that we've already resolved the supplier issue and we have booked one of the delayed orders and I expect to recover both the order timing and product delivery catch up within the year. 
Now I know that it makes investors nervous when growth is back end loaded, so I'd like to provide some additional color on what we expect to drive that growth in our Government Systems' second half. Roughly 60% of the back half growth is either in backlog or annual follow-on business, where our customers make annual buys throughout the year. All this looks to be well funded, so I don't see much risk here. About 25% of the second half growth is in programs that we have won but are not yet awarded. The only risk is the timing of the contract action and we're tracking that very closely now are confident that we're closing in a timely manner for our year. And then the last 15% of the second half growth are programs that we have yet to go out and win. And that number is in line with our normal historical anticipated sales profile for this point in the year. So despite the challenging first quarter, I remain confident in our low single-digit growth for the full year in Government Systems. 
Now before I move from government systems, I do want to make a few comments about the budget outlook. First of all, the new budget is not good news for our Government business. If you recall, we've been forecasting our government business with sequestration as the budget baseline and as I'm sure you know, the agreement is an improvement from that baseline. I also believe that we're well positioned to at least get our fair share of the budget increases, given their priorities and the breadth of our portfolio. I would expect that we'll start seeing some of this improvement as early as next year. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we get a little tail wind on short cycle orders by the end of this year. So this is a strong boost to our plan to return government systems to sustained growth. 
Moving now to Commercial Systems. First quarter results were in line with our expectations. OEM sales were down, primarily driven by the impact of the previously announced Global Express rate reductions at Bombardier, but we did see nice growth in our Commercial Systems aftermarket. We delivered another quarter of strong operating performance headlined by 22.2% operating margins and our Commercial Systems team did a really great job of controlling their spending to manage the margin impact from the Global 5000, 6000 production cuts at Bombardier. 
Fiscal 2016 is an important year of program execution for our Commercial Systems and we completed a large number of milestones in the first quarter, including the certification of the C Series and ARJ-21 aircraft, first flight of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, entry into service of the Challenger 650 at Bombardier, entry into service of the Fusion equipped King Airs at Cessna and entry into service of the legacy 450 at Embraer. All these programs are important in our long-term growth plan for our Commercial Systems business. 
Now finally, let me turn to Information Management Services where we delivered mid-single-digit topline sales growth for the quarter and some really strong operating margin performance, 130 basis point improvement over the year -- over the prior year. Our core Aviation business grew at 7% and continues to drive the incremental margin improvement that we expect from that business. In the year, most -- I'm sorry -- last year, most of our revenue synergies from the business aviation side of the business were leveraging synergies between the ARINCDirect services and Rockwell Collins' international flight operation service portfolios. And while we anticipate some additional opportunities in this part of the business, we're now starting to see synergies in other areas of the business. For example, we've secured a number of new agreements to provide Global Xpress connectivity services in the cabin, allowing us to address the broadband connectivity market that we have not previously served. We also signed launch customers for our ARINC MultiLink flight tracking service, which is compliant with the new European mandate that will help airlines keep track of their fleet. 
I know I probably sound like a broken record, but I continue to be extremely pleased with the acquisition of ARINC for both the financial perspective and how well the culture of the ARINC team and the Rockwell Collins' family. I think we continue to expect more good things to come from this business. 
So in summary for the quarter, I feel really good about achieving our full-year plan. We have good line of sight to the second half of growth and we successfully executed our restructuring plan in the first quarter, which will deliver benefits going forward. The permanent reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit and the 2015 government budget deal are both very positive catalyst for Rockwell Collins' future and I continue to believe, with strong execution on new programs, we have a very optimistic outlook for the long-term growth drivers of our company. 
So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Patrick and have him walk through the financial details."
603843,320077236,920269,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3 where we highlight our total company first quarter sal",1075,"Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3 where we highlight our total company first quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding. Total company sales for the quarter decreased $57 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to lower government systems sales. Income from continuing operations decreased $36 million or 21% and earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.26 or 21% compared to the same period last year. 
Income from continuing operations includes a $28 million after-tax or $0.21 per share restructuring charge, primarily related to headcount actions across the company, which we are taking as a result of challenging market conditions, particularly in Business Aviation. In addition, the first quarter of both fiscal 2015 and 2016 includes our retroactive benefit from the Federal R&D Tax Credit of $0.16 and $0.18, respectively. 
As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $562 million for the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $18 million or 5% to $313 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, unfavorable airline selectable equipment mix and lower Airbus 330 production rates. All of that was partially offset by higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and Embraer legacy business jet production ramps. Aftermarket sales increased $17 million or 8%, primarily due to higher head-up display retrofit sales in China, higher inorganic sales from the acquisition of Pacific Avionics and International Communications Group, and higher regulatory mandate sales. Commercial Systems operating earnings were basically flat compared to last year with operating margins improving 20 basis points from 22% to 22.2%. 
Operating earnings and margin benefited from lower company funded research and development expense, partially offset by negative mix as an increasing customer-funded development sales offset lower Business Aviation product sales as well as higher cost from the Pacific Avionics and ICG acquisitions and higher costs from further expansion in international emerging markets. 
Now moving on to Slide 5. You'll see that we reclassified Government Systems sales categories into Avionics and Communication and Navigation. These sales categories have been consoled from the previous categories to be consistent with an internal reorganization and are delineated based on the underlying product technologies. Now Government Systems overall revenue decreased by 11% to $451 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, the timing of deliveries for the E-6 program, the wind down of an international electronic warfare program, lower simulation and training sales and lower international targeting system sales. Government Systems' first quarter operating earnings decreased $20 million to $86 million, resulting in operating margin of 19.1% compared to 20.8% in the first quarter of last year. The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted from lower sales volume. 
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services sales increased 5% over the prior year as commercial and business aviation services sales increased 7%, while the non-aviation-related businesses were flat compared to last year. Information Management Services' first quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $24 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.4% compared to 14.1% in the first quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to incremental earnings and higher sales volume. 
Now Slide 7 provides an update of R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $231 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to $228 million in the first quarter of 2016. Company funded R&D decreased $17 million due to lower development expenditures for the Embraer Legacy 450 and Airbus A350 as well as lower business jet product line development costs. Customer-funded research and development expense increased $5 million due to higher development costs for international programs in Commercial Systems. And production engineering investment net increased due to higher cost incurred for certain military transport programs in government systems. 
Moving to Slide 8. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter compared to the end of last year. During the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.0 from 1.7 at year end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first quarter had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we paid down a portion of that short-term debt. The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average cost of $87.40. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was about $290 million. 
Now on to Slide 10 where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as a result of the permanent reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit as well as an updated restructuring charge. Total sales in segment operating margins remain unchanged from the previous guidance. The earnings per share range has been increased by $0.25. The Federal R&D Tax Credit provided about a $0.35 benefit to our fiscal year 2016 earnings per share guidance and is partially offset by higher restructuring expense and higher incentive compensation expense. The cash flow from operations range has been increased by $50 million, primarily due to the benefit of that Federal R&D Tax Credit. 
Fiscal 2016 guidance for research and development investment and capital expenditures remains unchanged. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%, down from the previous guidance of about 28%, due again to the retroactive and perspective benefit from the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The second quarter of the year will have an effective tax rate of about 30%, which includes the benefit of that tax credit. And the third and fourth quarters will be similar to the second quarter, however, we expect some lumpiness to happen in the quarters as a benefit from certain tax planning strategies is expected to be realized. 
That completes my review of the financial results from projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

If you recall, we had put a little bit of discount in our forecast associated with anticipated further challenges to OEM production rates. What we normally have happened is, at this time of year, all the OEMs really gave us a trued up forecast as to what they're going to do for the year and, in fact, we did see that production rate decline. Really, we saw declines from most of the OEMs and you've heard, as you pointed out, you've heard some weakness described in the market from those folks. In fact, we'd use of the reserves but I had allocated for that. Now they typically hold pretty well through the fiscal year, if there's another adjustment that usually comes around the summer for low work time off period. So we're hopeful that we're trued up for the year. And that's what we put that discount there. Unfortunately, is it kind of the opportunity if we needed that discount to reflect this. As far as the long-term outlook, it still remain soft, David. And we continue to be fairly conservative in our outlook for Business Aviation. Now these rate levels are pretty low. I think they can be sustained, but we do need to continue to watch that market going forward. I don't have a better crystal ball for what production rates are going to look like next year. We'll true that off when we provide our guidance for next year."

So we'll see an improved overall growth rate and we put some strategies in place to address the growth in that business. Now I think this is going to be an important year to see whether those strategies are going to play out.

And the impact on incentive compensation, if you remember, last time we had a big catch up in R&D. We had an EPS as a goal, and incentive compensation. We took that out but we still have a goal associated with cash flow and the R&D tax credit generated incremental cash flow, which is generating higher incentive compensation because we've raised our cash flow goal by $50 million.

And so we just track that kind of as a lot a little orders. We track that relative to how do we look firm this year versus historical. And we look pretty good with improving budget environment, that maybe actually opportunity for us.

603843,320077236,920358,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. If you recall on last quarter's earnings call, we said that we expected the first half of fiscal year '16 to be a slow start to the year, followed by growth in the second half. We expected the first quarter to be",1094,"Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. If you recall on last quarter's earnings call, we said that we expected the first half of fiscal year '16 to be a slow start to the year, followed by growth in the second half. We expected the first quarter to be the weakest and in fact, it was even a little weaker than we anticipated, most notably in government systems. So let me take that head on and summarize the performance and outlook of each of the businesses, and I'll start with our Government Systems business.
Due to program timing, we expected our Government Systems business to be down mid-single digits in the first half, followed by nice growth in the second half, resulting in overall low single-digit growth for the year. In the first quarter, we did experience the anticipated headwinds that we outlined on last quarter's earnings call. However, we were also impacted by 2 issues that we did not anticipate, one was a supplier issue that impacted late quarter deliveries of some products and the other was a delay in some expected follow-on orders. All in, the supplier issue and the order timing delay caused about a 500 basis point impact to our Government Systems for the quarter. The good news is that we've already resolved the supplier issue and we have booked one of the delayed orders, and I expect to recover both the order timing and product delivery catch-up within the year.
Now I know that it makes investors nervous when growth is back end loaded, so I'd like to provide some additional color on what we expect to drive that growth in our Government Systems' second half. Roughly 60% of the back half growth is either in backlog or annual follow-on business where our customers make annual buys throughout the year. All this looks to be well funded, so I don't see much risk here. About 25% of the second half growth is in programs that we have won but are not yet awarded. The only risk is the timing of the contract action, and we're tracking that very closely and are confident that we'll close in a timely manner for our year. And then the last 15% of the second half growth are programs that we have yet to go out and win. And that number is in line with our normal historical anticipated sales profile for this point in the year. So despite the challenging first quarter, I remain confident in our low single-digit growth for the full year in Government Systems.
Now before I move from government systems, I do want to make a few comments about the budget outlook. First of all, the new budget is net good news for our Government business. If you recall, we've been forecasting our Government business with sequestration as the budget baseline, and as I'm sure you know, the agreement is an improvement from that baseline. I also believe that we're well positioned to at least get our fair share of the budget increases, given their priorities and the breadth of our portfolio. I would expect that we'll start seeing some of this improvement as early as next year. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we get a little tail wind on short-cycle orders by the end of this year. So this is a strong boost to our plan to return Government Systems to sustained growth.
Moving now to Commercial Systems. First quarter results were in line with our expectations. OEM sales were down, primarily driven by the impact of the previously announced Global Express rate reductions at Bombardier, but we did see nice growth in our Commercial Systems aftermarket. We delivered another quarter of strong operating performance headlined by 22.2% operating margins. And our Commercial Systems team did a really great job of controlling their spending to manage the margin impact from the Global 5000, 6000 production cuts at Bombardier.
Fiscal 2016 is an important year of program execution for our Commercial Systems, and we completed a large number of milestones in the first quarter, including the certification of the CSeries and ARJ21 aircraft, first flight of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, entry into service of the Challenger 650 at Bombardier, entry into service of the Fusion-equipped King Airs at Cessna and entry into service of the legacy 450 at Embraer. All of these programs are important in our long-term growth plan for our Commercial Systems business.
Now finally, let me turn to Information Management Services where we delivered mid-single-digit top line sales growth for the quarter and some really strong operating margin performance, a 130 basis point improvement over the year -- over the prior year. Our core aviation business grew at 7% and continues to drive the incremental margin improvement that we expect from that business. In the year, most -- I'm sorry -- last year, most of our revenue synergies from the Business Aviation side of the business were leveraging synergies between the ARINCDirect services and Rockwell Collins' international flight operation service portfolios. And while we anticipate some additional opportunities in this part of the business, we're now starting to see synergies in other areas of the business. For example, we've secured a number of new agreements to provide Global Express connectivity service in the cabin, allowing us to address the broadband connectivity market that we have not previously served. We also signed launch customers for our ARINC MultiLink flight tracking service, which is compliant with the new European mandate that will help airlines keep track of their fleet.
I know I probably sound like a broken record, but I continue to be extremely pleased with the acquisition of ARINC from both a financial perspective and how well the culture of the ARINC team and the Rockwell Collins family. I think we continue to expect more good things to come from this business.
So in summary, for the quarter, I feel really good about achieving our full year plan. We have good line of sight to the second half growth and we successfully executed our restructuring plan in the first quarter, which will deliver benefit going forward. The permanent reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit and the 2015 government budget deal are both very positive catalysts for Rockwell Collins' future. And I continue to believe, with strong execution on new programs, we have a very optimistic outlook for the long-term growth drivers of our company.
So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Patrick and have him walk through the financial details."
603843,320077236,920358,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3 where we highlight our total company first quarter sal",1074,"Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3 where we highlight our total company first quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.
Total company sales for the quarter decreased $57 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to lower Government Systems sales. Income from continuing operations decreased $36 million or 21% and earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.26 or 21% compared to the same period last year.
Income from continuing operations includes a $28 million after-tax or $0.21 per share restructuring charge, primarily related to headcount actions across the company, which we are taking as a result of challenging market conditions, particularly in Business Aviation. In addition, the first quarter of both fiscal 2015 and 2016 includes a retroactive benefit from the Federal R&D Tax Credit of $0.16 and $0.18, respectively.
As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $562 million for the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $18 million or 5% to $313 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, unfavorable airline selectable equipment mix and lower Airbus 330 production rates. All of that was partially offset by higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and the Embraer Legacy business jet production ramps.
Aftermarket sales increased $17 million or 8%, primarily due to higher head-up display retrofit sales in China, higher inorganic sales from the acquisition of Pacific Avionics and International Communications Group and higher regulatory mandate sales. Commercial Systems operating earnings were basically flat compared to last year with operating margins improving 20 basis points from 22% to 22.2%. Operating earnings and margin benefited from lower company-funded research and development expense, partially offset by negative mix as an increasing customer-funded development sales offset lower Business Aviation product sales as well as higher cost from the Pacific Avionics and ICG acquisitions and higher costs from further expansion in international emerging markets.
Now moving on to Slide 5. You'll see that we reclassified Government Systems sales categories into Avionics and Communication and Navigation. These sales categories have been consolidated from the previous categories to be consistent within internal reorganization and are delineated based on the underlying product technologies. Now Government Systems' overall revenue decreased by 11% to $451 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, the timing of deliveries for the E-6 program, the wind down of an international electronic warfare program, lower simulation and training sales and lower international targeting system sales. Government Systems' first quarter operating earnings decreased $20 million to $86 million, resulting in operating margin of 19.1% compared to 20.8% in the first quarter of last year. The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted from the lower sales volume.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services sales increased 5% over the prior year as commercial and business aviation services sales increased 7%, while the non-aviation-related businesses were flat compared to last year. Information Management Services' first quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $24 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.4% compared to 14.1% in the first quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to incremental earnings and the higher sales volume.
Now Slide 7 provides an update of R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $231 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to $228 million in the first quarter of 2016. Company-funded R&D decreased $17 million due to lower development expenditures for the Embraer Legacy 450 and Airbus A350 as well as lower business jet product line development costs. Customer-funded research and development expense increased $5 million due to higher development costs for international programs in Commercial Systems. And pre-production engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for certain military transport programs in Government Systems.
Moving to Slide 8. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter compared to the end of last year. During the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.0 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first quarter had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we paid down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average cost of $87.40. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was about $290 million.
Now on to Slide 10 where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as a result of the permanent reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit as well as an updated restructuring charge. Total sales in segment operating margins remain unchanged from the previous guidance. The earnings per share range has been increased by $0.25. The Federal R&D Tax Credit provided about a $0.35 benefit to our fiscal year 2016 earnings per share guidance and is partially offset by higher restructuring expense and higher incentive compensation expense. The cash flow from operations range has been increased by $50 million, primarily due to the benefit of that Federal R&D Tax Credit.
Fiscal 2016 guidance for research and development investment and capital expenditures remains unchanged. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%, down from the previous guidance of about 28%, due again to the retroactive and prospective benefit from the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The second quarter of the year will have an effective tax rate of about 30%, which includes the benefit of that tax credit. And the third and fourth quarters will be similar to the second quarter. However, we expect some lumpiness to happen in the quarters as the benefit from certain tax planning strategies is expected to be realized.
That completes my review of the financial results from projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

What we normally -- have happened is in -- at this time of year, all the OEMs really gave us a trued-up forecast as to what they're going to do for the year. And in fact, we did see that production rate decline. Really, we saw declines from most of the OEMs. And you've heard -- as you pointed out, you've heard some weakness described in the market from those folks. In fact, we've used up the reserve that I had allocated for that. Now they typically hold pretty well through the fiscal year. If there's another adjustment, it usually comes around the summer, furlough work time-off period. So we're hopeful that we're trued up for the year, and that's why we put that discount there. Unfortunately, is isn't going to be opportunity. It's -- we needed that discount to reflect this. As far as the long-term outlook, it still remains soft, David, and we continue to be fairly conservative in our outlook for Business Aviation. Now these rate levels are pretty low. I think they can be sustained, but we do need to continue to watch that market going forward. I don't have a better crystal ball for what production rates are going to look like next year. We'll true that up when we provide our guidance for next year."

For those of you who are program specific in government, you'll understand what programs are driving that. So I talked about 60% being firm and follow-on. If you look at the firm contracts, KC-390, KC-46, some rotary wing at AgustaWestland and Sikorsky, Saudi F-15, are all firm programs that have first half, second half growth. I'm confident that the KC-390 first half, second half growth will be achieved in spite of the economic situation. We're funded by Embraer. I don't mean they're necessarily funded by their customer, but they are going forward with that. I do think we'll probably see some future delays on the KC-390 program, but at this point, nothing in this fiscal year. Then in that, I also talk about follow-on in that 60%. And these are annual buys, things like the R210, MIDS data links, our KC-135 Block 45 program, where the customer buys the annual work on a yearly basis. They're all funded, they're in the plan and I don't see, really, any risk there. The 15% that I talked about is really -- there's no real large program drivers. Some of them are international. These are things we did a bid on or we're waiting a decision. And we also have quite a bit of just short-cycle stuff where we get an order and sell it out as finished goods. And so we just track that kind of as a lot of little orders. We track that relative to how do we look firm versus -- this year versus historical and we look pretty good. With the improving budget environment, that may be actually an opportunity for us. But I don't see anything that's out of the normal, nor do I see any major one program driver in that 15%."

I mentioned the CSeries certification now where our teams are focused with supporting Bombardier to get to entry into service here middle of the year.

603843,320077236,920391,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. If you recall on last quarter's earnings call, we said that we expected the first half of fiscal year '16 to be a slow start to the year, followed by growth in the second half. We expected the first quarter to be",1093,"Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. If you recall on last quarter's earnings call, we said that we expected the first half of fiscal year '16 to be a slow start to the year, followed by growth in the second half. We expected the first quarter to be the weakest and in fact, it was even a little weaker than we anticipated, most notably in government systems. So let me take that head on and summarize the performance and outlook of each of the businesses, and I'll start with our Government Systems business.
Due to program timing, we expected our Government Systems business to be down mid-single digits in the first half, followed by nice growth in the second half, resulting in overall low single-digit growth for the year. In the first quarter, we did experience the anticipated headwinds that we outlined on last quarter's earnings call. However, we were also impacted by 2 issues that we did not anticipate. One was a supplier issue that impacted late quarter deliveries of some products and the other was a delay in some expected follow-on orders. All in, the supplier issue and the order timing delay caused about a 500 basis point impact to our Government Systems for the quarter. The good news is that we've already resolved the supplier issue and we have booked one of the delayed orders, and I expect to recover both the order timing and product delivery catch-up within the year.
Now I know that it makes investors nervous when growth is back end loaded, so I'd like to provide some additional color on what we expect to drive that growth in our Government Systems' second half. Roughly 60% of the back half growth is either in backlog or annual follow-on business where our customers make annual buys throughout the year. All this looks to be well funded, so I don't see much risk here. About 25% of the second half growth is in programs that we have won but are not yet awarded. The only risk is the timing of the contract action, and we're tracking that very closely and are confident that we'll close in a timely manner for our year. And then the last 15% of the second half growth are programs that we have yet to go out and win. And that number is in line with our normal historical anticipated sales profile for this point in the year. So despite the challenging first quarter, I remain confident in our low single-digit growth for the full year in Government Systems.
Now before I move from government systems, I do want to make a few comments about the budget outlook. First of all, the new budget is net good news for our Government business. If you recall, we've been forecasting our Government business with sequestration as the budget baseline, and as I'm sure you know, the agreement is an improvement from that baseline. I also believe that we're well positioned to at least get our fair share of the budget increases, given their priorities and the breadth of our portfolio. I would expect that we'll start seeing some of this improvement as early as next year. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we get a little tailwind on short-cycle orders by the end of this year. So this is a strong boost to our plan to return Government Systems to sustained growth.
Moving now to Commercial Systems. First quarter results were in line with our expectations. OEM sales were down, primarily driven by the impact of the previously announced Global Express rate reductions at Bombardier, but we did see nice growth in our Commercial Systems aftermarket. We delivered another quarter of strong operating performance headlined by 22.2% operating margins. And our Commercial Systems team did a really great job of controlling their spending to manage the margin impact from the Global 5000, 6000 production cuts at Bombardier.
Fiscal 2016 is an important year of program execution for our Commercial Systems, and we completed a large number of milestones in the first quarter, including the certification of the CSeries and ARJ21 aircraft, first flight of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, entry into service of the Challenger 650 at Bombardier, entry into service of the Fusion-equipped King Airs at Cessna and entry into service of the legacy 450 at Embraer. All of these programs are important in our long-term growth plan for our Commercial Systems business.
Now finally, let me turn to Information Management Services where we delivered mid-single-digit top line sales growth for the quarter and some really strong operating margin performance, a 130 basis point improvement over the year -- over the prior year. Our core aviation business grew at 7% and continues to drive the incremental margin improvement that we expect from that business. In the year, most -- I'm sorry -- last year, most of our revenue synergies from the Business Aviation side of the business were leveraging synergies between the ARINCDirect services and Rockwell Collins' international flight operation service portfolios. And while we anticipate some additional opportunities in this part of the business, we're now starting to see synergies in other areas of the business. For example, we've secured a number of new agreements to provide Global Express connectivity service in the cabin, allowing us to address the broadband connectivity market that we have not previously served. We also signed launch customers for our ARINC MultiLink flight tracking service, which is compliant with the new European mandate that will help airlines keep track of their fleet.
I know I probably sound like a broken record, but I continue to be extremely pleased with the acquisition of ARINC from both a financial perspective and how well the culture of the ARINC team and the Rockwell Collins family. I think we continue to expect more good things to come from this business.
So in summary, for the quarter, I feel really good about achieving our full year plan. We have good line of sight to the second half growth and we successfully executed our restructuring plan in the first quarter, which will deliver benefit going forward. The permanent reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit and the 2015 government budget deal are both very positive catalysts for Rockwell Collins' future. And I continue to believe, with strong execution on new programs, we have a very optimistic outlook for the long-term growth drivers of our company.
So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Patrick and have him walk through the financial details."
603843,320077236,920391,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3 where we highlight our total company first quarter sal",1076,"Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3 where we highlight our total company first quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.
Total company sales for the quarter decreased $57 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to lower Government Systems sales. Income from continuing operations decreased $36 million or 21% and earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.26 or 21% compared to the same period last year.
Income from continuing operations includes a $28 million after-tax or $0.21 per share restructuring charge, primarily related to headcount actions across the company, which we are taking as a result of challenging market conditions, particularly in Business Aviation. In addition, the first quarter of both fiscal 2015 and 2016 includes a retroactive benefit from the Federal R&D Tax Credit of $0.16 and $0.18, respectively.
As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $562 million for the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $18 million or 5% to $313 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, unfavorable airline selectable equipment mix and lower Airbus 330 production rates. All of that was partially offset by higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and the Embraer Legacy business jet production ramps.
Aftermarket sales increased $17 million or 8%, primarily due to higher head-up display retrofit sales in China, higher inorganic sales from the acquisition of Pacific Avionics and International Communications Group and higher regulatory mandate sales. Commercial Systems operating earnings were basically flat compared to last year with operating margins improving 20 basis points from 22% to 22.2%. Operating earnings and margin benefited from lower company-funded research and development expense, partially offset by negative mix as an increasing customer-funded development sales offset lower Business Aviation product sales as well as higher cost from the Pacific Avionics and ICG acquisitions and higher costs from further expansion in international emerging markets.
Now moving on to Slide 5. You'll see that we reclassified Government Systems sales categories into Avionics and Communication and Navigation. These sales categories have been consolidated from the previous categories to be consistent within internal reorganization and are delineated based on the underlying product technologies. Now Government Systems' overall revenue decreased by 11% to $451 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, the timing of deliveries for the E-6 program, the wind down of an international electronic warfare program, lower simulation and training sales and lower international targeting system sales. Government Systems' first quarter operating earnings decreased $20 million to $86 million, resulting in operating margin of 19.1% compared to 20.8% in the first quarter of last year. The decreased operating earnings and margin resulted from the lower sales volume.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services sales increased 5% over the prior year as commercial and business aviation services sales increased 7%, while the non-aviation-related businesses were flat compared to last year. Information Management Services' first quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $24 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.4% compared to 14.1% in the first quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to incremental earnings and the higher sales volume.
Now Slide 7 provides an update of our R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $231 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to $228 million in the first quarter of 2016. Company-funded R&D decreased $17 million due to lower development expenditures for the Embraer Legacy 450 and Airbus A350 as well as lower business jet product line development costs. Customer-funded research and development expense increased $5 million due to higher development costs for international programs in Commercial Systems. And pre-production engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for certain military transport programs in Government Systems.
Moving to Slide 8. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the first quarter compared to the end of the last year. During the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.0 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first quarter had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we paid down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the first quarter is detailed on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average cost of $87.40. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was about $290 million.
Now on to Slide 10 where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as a result of the permanent reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit as well as an updated restructuring charge. Total sales in segment operating margins remain unchanged from the previous guidance. The earnings per share range has been increased by $0.25. The Federal R&D Tax Credit provided about a $0.35 benefit to our fiscal year 2016 earnings per share guidance and is partially offset by higher restructuring expense and higher incentive compensation expense. The cash flow from operations range has been increased by $50 million, primarily due to the benefit of that Federal R&D Tax Credit.
Fiscal 2016 guidance for research and development investment and capital expenditures remains unchanged. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 is now expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%, down from the previous guidance of about 28%, due again to the retroactive and prospective benefit from the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The second quarter of the year will have an effective tax rate of about 30%, which includes the benefit of that tax credit. And the third and fourth quarters will be similar to the second quarter. However, we expect some lumpiness to happen in the quarters as the benefit from certain tax planning strategies is expected to be realized.
That completes my review of the financial results from projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

If you recall, we had put a little bit of discount in our forecast associated with anticipated further challenges to OEM production rates. What we normally have happen is in -- at this time of year, all the OEMs really give us a trued-up forecast as to what they're going to do for the year. And in fact, we did see that production rate decline. Really, we saw declines from most of the OEMs. And you've heard -- as you pointed out, you've heard some weakness described in the market from those folks. In fact, we've used up the reserve that I had allocated for that. Now they typically hold pretty well through the fiscal year. If there's another adjustment, it usually comes around the summer, furlough work time-off period. So we're hopeful that we're trued up for the year, and that's why we put that discount there. Unfortunately, it isn't going to be opportunity. It's -- we needed that discount to reflect this. As far as the long-term outlook, it still remains soft, David, and we continue to be fairly conservative in our outlook for Business Aviation. Now these rate levels are pretty low. I think they can be sustained, but we do need to continue to watch that market going forward. I don't have a better crystal ball for what production rates are going to look like next year. We'll true that up when we provide our guidance for next year."

Obviously, all eyes are on the basic 777 backlog and the ability of Boeing to sustain that. And we're still watching that just like you are. I've got nothing to update you on that. One thing I've said is that Boeing would need to give us an updated rate forecast on the existing 777 here pretty soon to have any impact on our fiscal year '16. And the fact that they came out with rate changes on 747-8 and didn't do that on 777 tells me that there's still margin to their plan to sustain the basic 777 rates, at least through the demand for our fiscal '16. So nothing new really to report on that, still very healthy backlog for us. And as you know, we've got new share gain opportunities coming into the market."

So my question is, will R&D stay at this lower level throughout the year or are there other -- some of those other issues I just mentioned, one-time items? Or what's going on to effectively cause a 170 basis point drop in the underlying margin?"

Now what's going to happen going forward is we're going to see, I'll say, a steady shift between company-funded R&D going up and our deferred engineering investment coming down over the course of the quarters. Now that's going to be offset by restructuring savings, which, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we didn't get much of any in the first quarter. So we'll be benefiting from the restructuring savings, plus we should be getting higher volume and with higher volume, getting the incremental flow on that. So I'm confident that we'll continue to generate good margins on the commercial side of the business, but the dynamics will be as I described."

So it really was just a blip. You shouldn't think of that as any kind of systemic issue. In terms of the order timing, the one that I highlighted, the Pakistan C-130, we had expected quite early in the fiscal quarter.

For those of you who are program specific in government, you'll understand what programs are driving that. So I talked about 60% being firm and follow-on. If you look at the firm contracts, KC-390, KC-46, some rotary wing at AgustaWestland and Sikorsky, Saudi F-15, are all firm programs that have first half, second half growth. I'm confident that the KC-390 first half, second half growth will be achieved in spite of the economic situation. We're funded by Embraer. That doesn't mean they're necessarily funded by their customer, but they are going forward with that. I do think we'll probably see some future delays on the KC-390 program, but at this point, nothing in this fiscal year. Then in that, I also talk about follow-on in that 60%. And these are annual buys, things like the R210, MIDS data links, our KC-135 Block 45 program, where the customer buys the annual work on a yearly basis. They're all funded, they're in the plan and I don't see, really, any risk there. The 15% that I talked about is really -- there's no real large program drivers. Some of them are international. These are things we've either bid on or we're waiting a decision. And we also have quite a bit of just short-cycle stuff where we get an order and sell it out of finished goods. And so we just track that kind of as a lot of little orders. We track that relative to how do we look firm versus -- this year versus historical and we look pretty good. With the improving budget environment, that may be actually opportunity for us. But I don't see anything that's out of the normal, nor do I see any major one program driver in that 15%."

With 2 quarters down, our fiscal year 2016 is progressing directionally as we expected. As we indicated in October and again in our last quarterly call, this is definitely a first half, second half story. An",1149,"Well. Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. With 2 quarters down, our fiscal year 2016 is progressing directionally as we expected. As we indicated in October and again in our last quarterly call, this is definitely a first half, second half story. And because we saw it coming, we've been very transparent about the Business Aviation production rates, as well as the Government Systems program timing and the impact on our top line sales profile for the year. 
We also, as you know, initiated a restructuring program to help sustain our bottom line performance. This restructuring was essentially complete in the first quarter, and I'm pleased to report that it's now delivering the savings that we expected. 
Now the largest shift in growth from the first half to the second half of the year is in our Government Systems business. So let me start here and give you an update on the metrics I outlined last quarter relative to that growth. 
In the last call, I said that about 60% of the back half growth was already in backlog or coming from annual buys of follow-on business. This category has now grown from 60% last quarter to 77% at the end of the second quarter. Again, this is all funded activities, so I don't see much risk here, and I'm pleased that we're making the progress in firming this up. 
Now the second category of growth is in programs that we have won, but have yet to be awarded. And this has decreased from 25% last quarter to 17% this quarter. The only risk in this area is moving these programs through the contracting action in the firm backlog. And at this point, I don't see anything that would keep us from firming up the 17%. And then the third category, which is the balance of the second half growth, is coming from programs that we have yet to go out and win. This category has decreased from 15% last quarter to now making up only 6% of our planned growth. As I look at all these metrics, we're right in line with our historical anticipated sales for this time of the year. So despite the challenging first half, we have good line of sight to the second half growth for government systems. And as a reminder, the fourth quarter is always the biggest in terms of sales and margins, and I do expect our growth rate to be the highest in the fourth quarter as well.
Now turning to Commercial Systems. The first half went about as expected, but the aftermarket components are a little different from what we originally anticipated. The business aviation has performed better-than-expected and the air transport aftermarket has been softer. As this turned out, the 2 have essential offset each other for the first half of the year, so our overall aftermarket performance remains on track. 
The strength in the Business Aviation aftermarket has been driven by mandates, which we expected, but also by stronger-than-expected cockpit retrofits. We introduced some new avionics aftermarket products late last year and they're selling quite well. The weaker air transport aftermarket is being driven by the impacts of recycling and we're also dealing with the impacts of more aggregators in the service market. I believe these are indicative of structural changes in how the airlines are managing their MRO needs, and we should no longer be expecting MRO to grow at traffic rate at least for the foreseeable future. 
Now air transport OEM rates are progressing as planned with production ramping for the 787, the A350 and the Airbus narrowbodies. These increases are partially offset by rate reductions in the A330. Now business jet OEM rates remain consistent with last quarter. And if you recall, I said in the last call, that the summer shutdown period is when we would likely see business jet reductions if there are going to be any more than happened this year. So that remains a watch area for us for the next quarter. 
Finally, let me turn to our Information Management Services business. This past quarter, we delivered 5% sales growth and really strong operating performance with margins improving by 370 basis points. Our core aviation business grew 8% for the quarter, driving the profitability for that business. 
While this is great performance, our top line to date is a bit lower than I expected. We are seeing weaker demand for Business Aviation international trips support, which has been hit pretty hard in Russia, China and in oil-producing countries. Without a pick-up here, we'll probably see our IMS business grow a bit slower for the full year than originally expected. We are expecting, though, to see growth in the second half from the non-aviation portion of the business. And I do want to point out that the better-than-expected profitability should more than offset any top line weakness in our IMS portfolio for the year. 
So having walked through the 3 business segments, let me now turn to our longer-term outlook. We achieved several very important milestones on programs that drive our long-term growth. These include the first flight of the Boeing 737 MAX with our new standard equipment all delivered on time and working very well. The first refueling flight was performed on the KC-46 tanker invalidating both our Avionics and the refueling mission package, which is a first using 3D image technology. And we're also selected as one of the suppliers on the U.S. Army's Manpack radio program, which is a key step towards bringing this large growth opportunity to reality.
Also in March, we are recognized by the Sphere Institute as one of 2016's most ethical companies, and this is the seventh year in a row receiving this award. So these achievements all demonstrate how we're striving to be the most trusted source of aviation and high integrity solutions in the world, and it's really some good reasons to be optimistic about the future of our company.
Now before I turn it over to Patrick, I do want to address an administrative item.  For years, we've issued our next fiscal year financial guidance in September. And I received feedback from many of you that it would make a lot more sense for us to issue the guidance when we announced our fourth quarter results, which typically happens at the end of October. So this is exactly what we plan to do for this coming year. Hopefully, this will make things more efficient for the investment community, as well as for Rockwell Collins, and it allow us to better align with the OEMs on production rates and we'll be able to discuss year-over-year financial guide because our full year results for fiscal '16 will be completed that time.
So with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details."
603843,328886258,960563,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'd like to begin on Slide 3, where we have our total company second quarte",1177,"Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'd like to begin on Slide 3, where we have our total company second quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding. 
Total company sales for the quarter decreased $30 million or 2% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower Government Systems sales. Income from continuing operations increased $9 million or 6% and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.08 or 7% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense due to permitted extension of federal research and development tax credit. 
As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $611 million in the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $17 million or 5% to $353 million, primarily due to lower business aircraft OEM production rates, unfavorable airline sensible equipment mix and lower Airbus A330 production rates, all partially offset by higher customer funded development program sales, higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 production rate ramps, and higher Bombardier C-Series sales and support of the century to service later this year.
Aftermarket sales increased $14 million or 6%, primarily due to higher business jet avionics retrofit mandate sales and higher inorganic sales from the acquisition of the International Communications Group. Commercial Systems operating earnings decreased $7 million with operating margins declining 80 basis points from 22.9% to 22.1%. Operating earnings and margins decreased in the prior year primarily due to sales mix, as lower margin customer funded the boatman sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased. In addition, SG&A cost increased from higher costs associated with recent acquisitions. These were partially offset by a lower company funded research and development expense and cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.
Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems overall revenue decreased by 5% to $538 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, lower sales from simulation and training programs, the wind down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international targeting system deliveries. 
Government Systems second quarter operating earnings decreased $6 million to $108 million, resulting in an operating margin that was flat with the second quarter of the prior year at 20.1%. The decreased operating earnings resulted from the lower sales volume, partially offset by lower company funded research and development expense and cost-saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services sales increased 5% over the prior year, as commercial and Business Aviation services sales increased 8% while the non-aviation-related businesses were slightly down compared to last year. Information Management Services second quarter operating earnings increased $7 million and $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17.9% compared to 14.2% in the second quarter last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings and the higher sales volume, as well as a favorable resolution of some certain prior year claims associated with international business jet support services.
Looking next to Slide 7. We show year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the second quarter, we generated $45 million of operating cash flow compared to $132 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted from the lower pretax earnings and net unfavorable changes to working capital, which were primarily due to the timing of sales related advanced payments for customers. These items are partially offset by lower tax payments. 
Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $489 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 to $470 million in the first 6 months, I'm sorry, $489 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 to $470 million in the first 6 months of FY '16. Company funded R&D decreased $43 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower Software Defined Radio development cost in Government Systems. Customer funded research and development expense increased $15 million due to higher development cost for regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind down of international electronic warfare program in government systems. Preproduction engineering investment net increased to the higher costs incurred for military program in Government Systems.
Moving to Slide 9, we show the status of our cattle structure as of the end of the second quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first 6 months of FY '16, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.1 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first half of the year typically late cash flows. I expect this level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the second quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at an average cost of $85.03. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $192 million. 
Now to Slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which remains unchanged from the guidance we want last quarter. We do now have some clarity on when we expect to benefit from the tax planning strategies that we initially guided would benefit the second half of fiscal '16. These tax funding strategies, which entail utilizing capital less carryforwards from prior years, is now expected to benefit our third fiscal quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter will likely be in the midteens and the tax rate for the fourth quarter will likely be in the neighborhood of about 30%. We still expect the full year tax rate to be between 22% and 23%. 
I also wanted to talk about the trajectory of our operating margins over the last half of the year, and we're expecting operating margins be about flat sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter. We do expect to the overall business will return to growth in the third quarter and net growth will drive incremental earnings. But we will also be shifting our engineering expense from deferred engineering to company funded engineering resulting in a fairly flat sequential total operating margins. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, you should expect to see more incremental margin growth due to the higher growth rate in sales that Kelly talked about a little earlier. 
That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

But in Business Aviation, we continue to see very strong mandate growth this quarter, which we did expect, as I said in the opening remarks. But we also introduced some fans upgrades, avionics upgrades into the market. And that -- again, that is selling very well. And I'm hopeful that, that will continue to sell and maybe give us some upside opportunity here in the balance of the year. In air transport, it's kind of the opposite story. We had mandate headwinds in air transport. Last year, we had a big engine sales, which didn't repeat. So we had a little bit of a comparable issue on that. If I strip all of the one-time activities, as well as our Intertrade use business sales out of air transport, just look at the fundamental MRO, we've been roughly flat the first 2 quarters in fundamental MRO. And I think that's about what we're going to see. They're flat to very low single-digit growth in that underlying MRO business as we deal with the new recycling phenomenon that's here to stay."

We're certainly seeing lift in things like Jay dam production rates associated with what's going on in the world. We are still struggling with the timing of getting things through the contracting action. That didn't improve. And as you look at our government business for the first half of the year, we guided at down mid single-digit. We ended up at 8% down. So we are a little behind where we wanted to be, and it's mostly getting some of these selected programs through the contracting action a few for military sales specific programs.

If there's fewer retirements, it's harder to find the used parts to turn. On the other hand, we continue to operate those platforms and drive MRO growth. For our portfolio, it's very wide body driven. So if you look this year, the retirements have abated, but most of that has been in the narrowbody. Some of the 75, 76 and 747-8 retirements are very high content aftermarket platforms for us. So if you want to look at that, I'd look more at the wide body, which may not be typical to other pure company portfolios. What we said all along is the aftermarket MRO is going to be, again, pretty flat to very low single-digit. The offset to that is the used parts sales out of our Intertrade. That comes very lumpy. This past quarter, we're down because we had an engine. We do have another engine sale in the back half of our fiscal year.

So that's all growth opportunity for us. We're very strong in the flight deck connectivity, but less so in the cabin. And GX will present a big opportunity for us. And we're also working with OneWeb rep for a next-generation program where will the exclusive supplier of the radio equipment and also a value-added reseller. And we're going to be bringing that onto the airbus platforms in the future. So I'm excited about it. It's happening. There's no question there's going to be strong demand for broadband connectivity. The connectivity solutions that are out there today that aren't broadband just aren't meeting the connected world needs that we all have. And once that happens, it opens the door to applications and services. And we're also focused at providing those kinds of capabilities where once you have broadband connectivity, you can move information easier on and off the airplane and provide additional services for either maintenance or operation improvements for the airlines going forward. So it's one of the drivers as to why we think the ARINC acquisition is a great value driver for the long term for our company.

We will delivering a roughly 30 radios, I think, into the Army. They'll take those through 2 test regimes, a development test regime and a contract test regime, to validate those radios against the overall requirements. So there will be no revenues in fiscal '16 associated with that program because these are free of charge radios. We're just providing them to the Army to go through the test. From the results of the test, then they will go to what I would call a call for improvement for the participants who past the test to then provide in a updated price for the next fiscal year buy. So I would say, Richard, it'll probably be this time next year before they make that decision. Their current plan is that they would down select from 3. If there are still 3 viable suppliers through the test phase, they would down select from 3 to 2 for that annual buy. Obviously, if that this time last year, there's actually very little revenue opportunity next year either because the revenue will go with the radios are delivered. So it really has moved to an '18 -- really, an '18 growth item. The other thing I'll say is that $12.7 billion, while I like the top line numbers. What that is, is that's the max quantities in every case other the IDIQ contracts. So think of this contract as a huge Matrix with max quantities all priced and they're all added together. This is not going to be a $12.7 billion contract in my mind. However, it'll be very significant, maybe more like $4 billion to $5 billion of revenue. How much comes to us depends on common to contractors. How much -- what percentage of that we went?

As we indicated in October and again in our last quarterly call, this is definitely a first-half, second-half story. An",1148,"Well, thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. With 2 quarters down, our fiscal year 2016 is progressing directionally as we expected. As we indicated in October and again in our last quarterly call, this is definitely a first-half, second-half story. And because we saw it coming, we've been very transparent about the Business Aviation production rates as well as the Government Systems program timing and the impact on our top line sales profile for the year. 
We also, as you know, initiated a restructuring program to help sustain our bottom line performance. This restructuring was essentially complete in the first quarter, and I'm pleased to report that it's now delivering the savings that we expected. 
Now the largest shift in growth from the first half to the second half of the year is in our Government Systems business. So let me start here and give you an update on the metrics I outlined last quarter relative to that growth. 
In the last call, I said that about 60% of the back-half growth was already in backlog or coming from annual buys of follow-on business. This category has now grown from 60% last quarter to 77% at the end of the second quarter. Again, this is all funded activities, so I don't see much risk here, and I'm pleased that we're making the progress in firming this up. 
Now the second category of growth is in programs that we have won, but have yet to be awarded. And this has decreased from 25% last quarter to 17% this quarter. The only risk in this area is moving these programs through the contracting action in the firm backlog. And at this point, I don't see anything that would keep us from firming up the 17%. 
And then the third category, which is the balance of the second half growth, is coming from programs that we have yet to go out and win. This category has decreased from 15% last quarter to now making up only 6% of our planned growth. 
As I look at all these metrics, we're right in line with our historical anticipated sales for this time of the year. So despite the challenging first half, we have good line of sight to the second half growth for Government Systems. And as a reminder, the fourth quarter is always the biggest in terms of sales and margins, and I do expect our growth rate to be the highest in the fourth quarter as well.
Now turning to Commercial Systems. The first half went about as expected, but the aftermarket components are a little different from what we originally anticipated. The Business Aviation has performed better than expected, and the air transport aftermarket has been softer. As this turned out, the 2 have essentially offset each other for the first half of the year, so our overall aftermarket performance remains on track. 
The strength in the Business Aviation aftermarket has been driven by mandates, which we expected, but also by stronger-than-expected cockpit retrofits. We introduced some new avionics aftermarket products late last year, and they're selling quite well. The weaker air transport aftermarket is being driven by the impacts of recycling, and we're also dealing with the impacts of more aggregators in the service market. I believe these are indicative of structural changes in how the airlines are managing their MRO needs, and we should no longer be expecting MRO to grow at traffic rates at least for the foreseeable future. 
Now air transport OEM rates are progressing as planned with production ramping for the 787, the A350 and the Airbus narrow-bodies. These increases are partially offset by rate reductions in the A330. Now business jet OEM rates remain consistent with last quarter. And if you recall, I said in the last call, that the summer shutdown period is when we would likely see business jet reductions if there are going to be any more that happened this year. So that remains a watch area for us for the next quarter. 
Finally, let me turn to our Information Management Services business. This past quarter, we delivered 5% sales growth and really strong operating performance with margins improving by 370 basis points. Our core aviation business grew 8% for the quarter, driving the profitability for that business. 
While this is great performance, our top line to date is a bit lower than I expected. We are seeing weaker demand for Business Aviation international trip support, which has been hit pretty hard in Russia, China and in oil-producing countries. Without a pick-up here, we'll probably see our IMS business grow a bit slower for the full year than originally expected. We are expecting, though, to see growth in the second half from the non-aviation portion of the business. And I do want to point out that the better-than-expected profitability should more than offset any top line weakness in our IMS portfolio for the year. 
So having walked through the 3 business segments, let me now turn to our longer-term outlook. We achieved several very important milestones on programs that drive our long-term growth. These include the first flight of the Boeing 737 MAX, with our new standard equipment all delivered on time and working very well. The first refueling flight was performed on the KC-46 tanker validating both our Avionics and the refueling mission package, which is a first using 3D image technology. And we're also selected as one of the suppliers on the U.S. Army's Manpack radio program, which is a key step towards bringing this large growth opportunity to reality.
Also in March, we are recognized by Ethisphere Institute as one of 2016's most ethical companies, and this is the seventh year in a row receiving this award. So these achievements all demonstrate how we're striving to be the most trusted source of aviation and high integrity solutions in the world, and it's really some good reasons to be optimistic about the future of our company.
Now before I turn it over to Patrick, I do want to address an administrative item. For years, we've issued our next fiscal year financial guidance in September. And I've received feedback from many of you that it would make a lot more sense for us to issue the guidance when we announced our fourth quarter results, which typically happens at the end of October. So this is exactly what we plan to do for this coming year. Hopefully, this will make things more efficient for the investment community as well as for Rockwell Collins, and it'll allow us to better align with the OEMs on production rates, and we'll be able to discuss year-on-year financial guidance because our full year results for fiscal '16 will be complete at that time.
So with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details."

I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'd like to begin on Slide 3, where we have our total company second quarte",1172,"Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'd like to begin on Slide 3, where we have our total company second quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding. 
Total company sales for the quarter decreased $30 million or 2% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower Government Systems sales. Income from continuing operations increased $9 million or 6% and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.08 or 7% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense due to permitted extension of Federal Research and Development Tax Credit. 
As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $611 million in the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $17 million or 5% to $353 million, primarily due to lower business aircraft OEM production rates, unfavorable airline selectable equipment mix and lower Airbus A330 production rates, all partially offset by higher customer-funded development program sales, higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 production rate ramps and higher Bombardier CSeries sales in support of its entry into service later this year.
Aftermarket sales increased $14 million or 6%, primarily due to higher business jet avionics retrofit mandate sales and higher inorganic sales from the acquisition of the International Communications Group. 
Commercial Systems' operating earnings decreased $7 million with operating margins declining 80 basis points from 22.9% to 22.1%. Operating earnings and margins decreased in the prior year, primarily due to sales mix as lower-margin customer-funded development sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased. In addition, SG&A cost increased from higher costs associated with recent acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a lower company-funded research and development expense and cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.
Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems' overall revenue decreased by 5% to $538 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, lower sales from simulation and training programs, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international targeting system deliveries. 
Government Systems' second quarter operating earnings decreased $6 million to $108 million, resulting in an operating margin that was flat with the second quarter of the prior year at 20.1%. The decreased operating earnings resulted from the lower sales volume, partially offset by lower company-funded research and development expense and cost saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services' sales increased 5% over the prior year as commercial and Business Aviation services sales increased 8%, while the nonaviation-related businesses were slightly down compared to last year. Information Management Services' second quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to  $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17.9% compared to 14.2% in the second quarter last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings and the higher sales volume as well as a favorable resolution of some certain prior year claims associated with international business jet support services.
Looking next to Slide 7. We show year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the second quarter, we generated $45 million of operating cash flow compared to $132 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted from the lower pretax earnings and net unfavorable changes to working capital, which were primarily due to the timing of sales related to advanced payments from customers. These items are partially offset by lower tax payments. 
Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $489 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 to $470 million in the first 6 months -- I'm sorry, $489 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 to $470 million in the first 6 months of FY '16. Company-funded R&D decreased $43 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower Software Defined Radio development cost in Government Systems. Customer-funded research and development expense increased $15 million due to higher development cost for regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems. Preproduction engineering investment net increased to the higher costs incurred for military program in Government Systems.
Moving to Slide 9, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the second quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first 6 months of FY '16, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.1 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper, as the first half of the year are typically late cash flows. I expect this level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year, and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the second quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at an average cost of $85.03. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $192 million. 
Now on to Slide 11 where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which remains unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. We do now have some clarity on when we expect to benefit from the tax planning strategies that we initially guided would benefit the second half of fiscal '16. These tax-funding strategies, which entail utilizing capital loss carryforwards from prior years, is now expected to benefit our third fiscal quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter will likely be in the mid-teens, and the tax rate for the fourth quarter will likely be in the neighborhood of about 30%. We still expect the full year tax rate to be between 22% and 23%. 
I also wanted to talk about the trajectory of our operating margins over the last half of the year, and we're expecting operating margins to be about flat sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter. We do expect the overall business will return to growth in the third quarter and net growth will drive incremental earnings. But we will also be shifting our engineering expense from deferred engineering to company-funded engineering, resulting in a fairly flat sequential total operating margins. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, you should expect to see more incremental margin growth due to the higher growth rate in sales that Kelly talked about a little earlier. 
That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

But in Business Aviation, we continue to see very strong mandate growth this quarter, which we did expect, as I said in the opening remarks. But we also introduced some fans upgrades, avionics upgrades into the market. And that -- again, that is selling very well. And I'm hopeful that, that will continue to sell and maybe give us some upside opportunity here in the balance of the year. In air transport, it's kind of the opposite story. We had mandate headwinds in air transport. Last year, we had a big engine sales, which didn't repeat. So we had a little bit of a comparable issue on that. If I strip all of the onetime activities as well as our Intertrade use business sales out of air transport, just look at the fundamental MRO. We've been roughly flat the first 2 quarters in fundamental MRO, and I think that's about what we're going to see. They're flat to very low single-digit growth in that underlying MRO business, as we deal with the new recycling phenomenon that's here to stay."

We just cut in our fusion flight deck on the King Airs, if you recall, and I think we're getting pretty good vibes from Cessna in the end market that just got certified in Europe. So we're hopeful that, that will continue to do what it needs to do to sustain rates there. And we'll watch the furlough summer time frame, as I talked about. That's where we get any kind of tweaking of rates. Now recognize that if they do change the rate, that's pretty light in our fiscal year. So I'm not anticipating a heck of a lot of movement here yet.

If there's fewer retirements, it's harder to find the used parts to turn. On the other hand, we continue to operate those platforms and drive MRO growth. For our portfolio, it's very wide-body driven. So if you look this year, the retirements have abated, but most of that has been in the narrow-body. Some of the 75, 76 and 747-8 retirements are very high content aftermarket platforms for us. So if you want to look at that, I'd look more at the wide-body, which may not be typical to other pure company portfolios. What we said all along is the aftermarket MRO is going to be, again, pretty flat to very low single digit. The offset to that is the used parts sales out of our Intertrade. That comes very lumpy. This past quarter, we're down because we had an engine a year ago. We do have another engine sale in the back half of our fiscal year.

We've booked our first 4 customers, 2 in Business Aviation and 2 in the air transport market for Global Express, which is the new you broadband Inmarsat capability. And we're working a lot of proposals now. We do see this as a big growth opportunity. And recognize, Ron, that today, we really don't provide much cabin-based broadband connectivity in the market. So that's all growth opportunity for us. We're very strong in the flight-deck connectivity, but less so in the cabin. And GX will present a big opportunity for us. We were also working with OneWeb for a next-generation broadband capability, where we're the exclusive supplier of the radio equipment and then also a value-added reseller. And we're going to bring -- be bringing that on to the airbus platforms in the future. So I'm excited about it. It's happening. There's no question. There's going to be strong demand for broadband connectivity. The connectivity solutions that are out there today that aren't broadband just aren't meeting the connected world needs that we all have. And once that happens, it opens the door to applications and services. And we're also focused at providing those kinds of capabilities where, once you have broadband and connectivity, you can move information easier on and off the airplane and provide additional services for either maintenance or operation improvements for the airlines going forward. So it's one of the drivers as to why we think the ARINC acquisition is a great value driver for the long term for our company.

We'll be delivering a roughly 30 radios, I think, into the Army. They'll take those through 2 test regimes, a development test regime and a contract test regime, to validate those radios against the overall requirements. So there will be no revenues in fiscal '16 associated with that program because these are free-of-charge radios. We're just providing them to the Army to go through the test. From the results of the test, then they will go to what I would call a call for improvement for the participants who past the test to then provide in a updated price for the next fiscal year buy. So I would say, Richard, it'll probably be this time next year before they make that decision. Their current plan is that they would down select from 3. If there are still 3 viable suppliers through the test phase, they would down select from 3 to 2 for that annual buy. Obviously, if that's this time next year, there's actually very little revenue opportunity next year either because the revenue will go when the radios are delivered. So it really has moved to an '18 -- really, an '18 growth item. The other thing I'll say is that $12.7 billion, while I like the top line numbers, what that is, is that's the max quantities in every case under the IDIQ contracts. So think of this contract as a huge matrix with max quantities all priced, and they're all added together. This is not going to be a $12.7 billion contract in my mind. However, it'll be very significant, maybe more like $4 billion to $5 billion of revenue. How much comes to us depends on how many contractors, how much -- what percentage that we win. We've said, hey, look, we can easily see $100 million a year kind of a revenue stream from this program, if not more."

With 2 quarters down, our fiscal year 2016 is progressing directionally as we expected. As we indicated in October and again in our last quarterly call, this is definitely a first-half, second-half story. And because we saw it coming, we've been very transparent about the Business Aviation production rates as well as the Government Systems program timing and the impact on our top line sales profile for the year. 
We also, as you know, initiated a restructuring program to help sustain our bottom line performance. This restructuring was essentially complete in the first quarter, and I'm pleased to report that it's now delivering the savings that we expected. 
Now the largest shift in growth from the first half to the second half of the year is in our Government Systems business. So let me start here and give you an update on the metrics I outlined last quarter relative to that growth. 
In the last call, I said that about 60% of the back-half growth was already in backlog or coming from annual buys of follow-on business. This category has now grown from 60% last quarter to 77% at the end of the second quarter. Again, this is all funded activities, so I don't see much risk here, and I'm pleased that we're making the progress in firming this up. 
Now the second category of growth is in programs that we have won, but have yet to be awarded. And this has decreased from 25% last quarter to 17% this quarter. The only risk in this area is moving these programs through the contracting action into firm backlog. And at this point, I don't see anything that would keep us from firming up this 17%. 
And then the third category, which is the balance of the second half growth, is coming from programs that we have yet to go out and win. This category has decreased from 15% last quarter to now making up only 6% of our planned growth. 
As I look at all these metrics, we're right in line with our historical anticipated sales for this time of the year. So despite the challenging first half, we have good line of sight to the second half growth for Government Systems. And as a reminder, the fourth quarter is always the biggest in terms of sales and margins, and I do expect our growth rate to be the highest in the fourth quarter as well.
Now turning to Commercial Systems. The first half went about as expected, but the aftermarket components are a little different from what we originally anticipated. The Business Aviation has performed better than expected, and the air transport aftermarket has been softer. As has turned out, the 2 have essentially offset each other for the first half of the year, so our overall aftermarket performance remains on track. 
The strength in the Business Aviation aftermarket has been driven by mandates, which we expected, but also by stronger-than-expected cockpit retrofits. We introduced some new avionics aftermarket products late last year, and they're selling quite well. The weaker air transport aftermarket is being driven by the impacts of recycling, and we're also dealing with the impacts of more aggregators in the service market. I believe these are indicative of structural changes in how the airlines are managing their MRO needs, and we should no longer be expecting MRO to grow at traffic rates at least for the foreseeable future. 
Now air transport OEM rates are progressing as planned, with production ramping for the 787, the A350 and the Airbus narrow-bodies. These increases are partially offset by rate reductions in the A330. Now business jet OEM rates remain consistent with last quarter. And if you recall, I said in the last call that the summer shutdown period is when we would likely see business jet reductions if there are going to be any more that happen this year. So that remains a watch area for us for the next quarter. 
Finally, let me turn to our Information Management Services business. This past quarter, we delivered 5% sales growth and really strong operating performance with margins improving by 370 basis points. Our core aviation business grew 8% for the quarter, driving the profitability for that business. 
While this is great performance, our top line to date is a bit lower than I expected. We are seeing weaker demand for Business Aviation international trip support, which has been hit pretty hard in Russia, China and in oil-producing countries. Without a pickup here, we'll probably see our IMS business grow a bit slower for the full year than originally expected. We are expecting, though, to see growth in the second half from the non-aviation portion of the business. And I do want to point out that the better-than-expected profitability should more than offset any top line weakness in our IMS portfolio for the year. 
So having walked through the 3 business segments, let me now turn to our longer-term outlook. We achieved several very important milestones on programs that drive our long-term growth. These include the first flight of the Boeing 737 MAX, with our new standard equipment all delivered on time and working very well. The first refueling flight was performed on the KC-46 tanker, validating both our Avionics and the refueling mission package, which is a first using 3D image technology. And we're also selected as one of the suppliers on the U.S. Army's Manpack radio program, which is a key step towards bringing this large growth opportunity to reality.
Also in March, we were recognized by Ethisphere Institute as one of 2016's most ethical companies, and this is the seventh year in a row receiving this award. So these achievements all demonstrate how we're striving to be the most trusted source of aviation and high-integrity solutions in the world, and it's really some good reasons to be optimistic about the future of our company.
Now before I turn it over to Patrick, I do want to address an administrative item. For years, we've issued our next fiscal year financial guidance in September. And I've received feedback from many of you that it would make a lot more sense for us to issue the guidance when we announce our fourth quarter results, which typically happens at the end of October. So this is exactly what we plan to do for this coming year. Hopefully, this will make things more efficient for the investment community as well as for Rockwell Collins, and it'll allow us to better align with the OEMs on production rates, and we'll be able to discuss year-on-year financial guidance because our full year results for fiscal '16 will be complete at that time.
So with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details."
603843,328886258,961052,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'd like to begin on Slide 3, where we have our total company second quarte",1172,"Thanks, Kelly, and good morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'd like to begin on Slide 3, where we have our total company second quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding. 
Total company sales for the quarter decreased $30 million or 2% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower Government Systems sales. Income from continuing operations increased $9 million or 6%, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.08 or 7% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense due to the permanent extension of Federal Research and Development Tax Credit. 
As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $611 million in the quarter, down 1% compared to the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $17 million or 5% to $353 million, primarily due to lower business aircraft OEM production rates, unfavorable airline selectable equipment mix and lower Airbus A330 production rates, all partially offset by higher customer-funded development program sales, higher deliveries in support of the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 production rate ramps and higher Bombardier CSeries sales in support of its entry into service later this year.
Aftermarket sales increased $14 million or 6%, primarily due to higher business jet avionics retrofit mandate sales and higher inorganic sales from the acquisition of the International Communications Group. 
Commercial Systems' operating earnings decreased $7 million, with operating margins declining 80 basis points, from 22.9% to 22.1%. Operating earnings and margins decreased in the prior year, primarily due to sales mix as lower-margin customer-funded development sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased. In addition, SG&A costs increased from higher costs associated with recent acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a lower company-funded research and development expense and cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.
Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems' overall revenue decreased by 5% to $538 million, driven by lower rotary wing hardware sales, lower sales from simulation and training programs, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international targeting system deliveries. 
Government Systems' second quarter operating earnings decreased $6 million to $108 million, resulting in an operating margin that was flat with the second quarter of the prior year at 20.1%. The decreased operating earnings resulted from the lower sales volume, partially offset by lower company-funded research and development expense and cost saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services' sales increased 5% over the prior year as commercial and Business Aviation services sales increased 8%, while the nonaviation-related businesses were slightly down compared to last year. Information Management Services' second quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $29 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17.9% compared to 14.2% in the second quarter last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings on the higher sales volume as well as a favorable resolution of some certain prior year claims associated with international business jet support services.
Looking next to Slide 7, we show year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the second quarter, we generated $45 million of operating cash flow compared to $132 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted from the lower pretax earnings and net unfavorable changes to working capital, which were primarily due to the timing of sales related to advanced payments from customers. These items were partially offset by lower tax payments. 
Slide 8 provides an update of our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $489 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 to $470 million in the first 6 months -- I'm sorry, $489 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 to $470 million in the first 6 months of FY '16. Company-funded R&D decreased $43 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower Software Defined Radio development cost in Government Systems. Customer-funded research and development expense increased $15 million due to higher development costs for regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems. Preproduction engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for military program in Government Systems.
Moving to Slide 9, we show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the second quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first 6 months of FY '16, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.1 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper, as the first half of the year had typically late cash flows. I expect this level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year, and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the second quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at an average cost of $85.03. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $192 million. 
Now on to Slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal year 2016 financial guidance, which remains unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. We do now have some clarity on when we expect to benefit from the tax planning strategies that we initially guided would benefit the second half of fiscal '16. These tax-planning strategies, which entail utilizing capital loss carryforwards from prior years, is now expected to benefit our third fiscal quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter will likely be in the mid-teens, and the tax rate for the fourth quarter will likely be in the neighborhood of about 30%. We still expect the full year tax rate to be between 22% and 23%. 
I also wanted to talk about the trajectory of our operating margins over the last half of the year. I'm expecting operating margins to be about flat sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter. We do expect the overall business will return to growth in the third quarter and net growth will drive incremental earnings, but we will also be shifting our engineering expense from deferred engineering to company-funded engineering, resulting in a fairly flat sequential total operating margins. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, you should expect to see more incremental margin growth due to the higher growth rate in sales that Kelly talked about a little earlier. 
That completes my review of the financial results and projections. So, Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

But in Business Aviation, we continue to see very strong mandate growth this quarter, which we did expect, as I said in the opening remarks. But we also introduced some fans upgrades, avionics upgrades into the market. And that -- again, that is selling very well. And I'm hopeful that, that will continue to sell and maybe give us some upside opportunity here in the balance of the year. In air transport, it's kind of the opposite story. We had mandate headwinds in air transport. Last year, we had a big engine sale, which didn't repeat. So we had a little bit of a comparable issue on that. If I strip all of the onetime activities as well as our Intertrade used business sales out of air transport, just look at the fundamental MRO. we've been roughly flat the first 2 quarters in fundamental MRO, and I think that's about what we're going to see, either flat to very low single-digit growth in that underlying MRO business, as we deal with the new recycling phenomenon that's here to stay."

We're certainly seeing lift in things like JDM production rates associated with what's going on in the world. We are still struggling with the timing of getting things through the contracting action. That hadn't improved. And as you look at our government business for the first half of the year, we guided at down mid single-digit. We ended up at 8% down. So we are a little behind where we wanted to be, and it's mostly getting some of these selected programs through the contracting action a few for military sales specific programs. But we've got good visibility to that. I'm pretty confident we'll be able to get that done by the end of the fiscal year."

We just cut in our fusion flight deck on the King Airs, if you recall, and I think we're getting pretty good vibes from Cessna in the end market that just got certified in Europe. So we're hopeful that, that will continue to do what it needs to do to sustain rates there. And we'll watch the furlough summer time frame, as I talked about. That's where we get any kind of tweaking of rates. Now recognize that if they do change the rates, that's pretty light in our fiscal year. So I'm not anticipating a heck of a lot of movement here yet. But I think there's still a little bit of risk of adjustments here with the summer time frame."

But what's sort of the offset there from Intertrade, first of all? Second of all, what was the contribution there from inorganic sales in the quarter from the acquisitions? And then third, just kind of more qualitatively. Is there something -- I mean, this is an issue that has affected various companies in the aftermarket in a couple of different -- at different time periods and for a couple of different ways. Is there anything specific you see about your products that makes this kind of better or worse or longer-lasting than elsewhere?"

If there's fewer retirements, it's harder to find the used parts to turn. On the other hand, we continue to operate those platforms and drive MRO growth. For our portfolio, it's very wide-body driven. So if you look this year, the retirements have abated, but most of that has been in the narrow-body. Some of the 75, 76 and 747-8 retirements are very high-content aftermarket platforms for us. So if you want to look at that, I'd look more at the wide-body, which may not be typical to other pure company portfolios. What we said all along is the aftermarket MRO is going to be, again, pretty flat to very low single digit. The offset to that is the used parts sales out of our Intertrade. That comes very lumpy. This past quarter, we were down because we had an engine a year ago. We do have another engine sale in the back half of our fiscal year. So we have some things that are going to create a lumpy overall environment, because it's really going to be driven more by our Intertrade sales than the underlying MRO."

So that's all growth opportunity for us. We're very strong in the flight-deck connectivity, but less so in the cabin. And GX will present a big opportunity for us. And we are also working with OneWeb for a next-generation broadband capability, where we're the exclusive supplier of the radio equipment and then also a value-added reseller. And we're going to bring -- be bringing that on to the airbus platforms in the future. So I'm excited about it. It's happening. There's no question there's going to be strong demand for broadband connectivity. The connectivity solutions that are out there today that aren't broadband just aren't meeting the connected world needs that we all have. And once that happens, it opens the door to applications and services. And we're also focused at providing those kinds of capabilities, where once you have broadband and connectivity, you can move information easier on and off the airplane and provide additional services for either maintenance or operation improvements for the airlines going forward.

We'll be delivering a roughly 30 radios, I think, into the Army. They'll take those through 2 test regimes, a development test regime and a contract test regime, to validate those radios against the overall requirements. So there will be no revenues in fiscal '16 associated with that program because these are free-of-charge radios. We're just providing them to the Army to go through the test. From the results of the test, then they will go to what I would call a call for improvement for the participants who pass the test to then provide an updated price for the next fiscal year buy. So I would say, Richard, it'll probably be this time next year before they make that decision. Their current plan is that they would down select from 3. If there are still 3 viable suppliers through the test phase, they would down select from 3 to 2 for that annual buy. Obviously, if that's this time next year, there's actually very little revenue opportunity next year either because the revenue will go when the radios are delivered. So it really has moved to an '18 -- really, an '18 growth item. The other thing I'll say is that $12.7 billion, while I like the top line numbers, what that is, is that's the max quantities in every case under the IDIQ contract. So think of this contract as a huge matrix with max quantities all priced, and they're all added together. This is not going to be a $12.7 billion contract in my mind. However, it'll be very significant, maybe more like $4 billion to $5 billion of revenue. How much comes to us depends on how many contractors, how much -- what percentage that we win. We've said, hey, look, we can easily see $100 million a year kind of a revenue stream from this program, if not more."

This was really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses. 
Among the market highlights was the C-Series entry in the service with Swiss Air. We're very pleased to see Bombardier accomplish this major milestone and it's a real sign that this program is turning the quarter. As you know, this has been a big investment for us, and we're all pleased to be moving from the investment phase to the return phase for this program. 
Another major OEM accomplishment was the successful refueling test with the KC-46 tanker, paving the way towards production of that airplane. These are both important programs for our long-term growth in our commercial and government businesses. Annually, both Boeing and Airbus survey the airlines to gauge their supplier performance and customer support. And recently, it was announced that Rockwell Collins was ranked #1 for both Airbus and Boeing. In fact, we are ranked ahead both of the OEMs themselves. I'm very proud of our team's performance, which is a testament to our brand promise in building trust every day and will help us to continue to be the supplier of choice in our markets. 
Overall, we executed our business quite well during the quarter, delivering solid margin performance while also stepping up our R&D spending in Commercial Systems to support the development of the 777X. We also made great progress in booking the government orders necessary to achieve our abnormally large second half sales plan. And our IMS business grew 10%, and we achieved our expected growth in the non-aviation segment, which demonstrates that some of our strategies to grow that portion of our business are beginning to take traction. 
Now we're not without challenges, and they seemed to be focused in our Commercial Systems markets right now. The Business Aviation and market continues to struggle to find the bottom. This last quarter, we saw shaky utilization and recently, we've seen even further declines in demand from the OEMs. If you recall, we started the year with some discount in OEM production. And we saw reduced at the beginning of the calendar year, which used up our discount and then some. I was hoping to see demand stabilize through the summer, but unfortunately, this hasn't been the case. This is going to further impact our top line in Commercial Systems. Just to give you some color on this. It's not really specific to any particular airplane type, but rather an overall market condition.
We're seeing softness in product demand across all major business jet manufacturers. Recall that we moved our fiscal 2016 guidance back to the fourth quarter earnings call to allow us to get better aligned with the OEMs, and I think this is going to be really applicable to bizjet demand this year. It's not yet clear to us how these latest changes from the OEMs will impact their 2017 demand. And I'm that they're going to be monitoring the next quarter of market dynamics before they set that outlook.
In addition, we've had another quarter of no growth in air transport MRO. And in the last earnings call, I indicated that I believe this is a structural change to our aftermarket due to the component recycling practices at the airlines. So if you couple the Business Aviation OEM and the air transport aftermarket sales environments, we're lowering our Commercial Systems sales forecast for the year from up single-digits to down about 1%. 
On a more positive note, as I mentioned earlier, Government Systems had a nice quarter in sales and earnings, but has an even bigger fourth quarter yet to go. And as I've done in the last couple of calls, I'd like to give you some granularity on how we're progressing in capturing the business to achieve that growth. 
During the last quarterly call, I said that 77% of the second half growth was either in backlog or coming from annual follow-on buys. This is now at 94% at the end of the third quarter. So I remain very confident in our ability to achieve the sales growth that we projected and finished the year strong.
Some of these sales will be later in the year than we originally planned and it's going to stress our ability to collect cash by year-end, and that's a contributor to us adjusting our guidance on cash flow to lower end of our previous range. 
So to summarize before Patrick takes you through the details of the quarter, we really executed well this past quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see the restructuring savings flowing as we expected. And we are successfully bringing in the government business need to accomplish the abnormally large second half ramp. Business Aviation remains a challenge for us as the industry is still searching for the bottom of the market. And I continue to see good things from our IMS business, and we're making good progress on the new OEM programs that will set us up for future growth. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details."
603843,368020381,1011264,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you to today's presentation slide that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, e",1116,"Thanks, Kelly, and morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you to today's presentation slide that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding. 
Total company sales for the quarter increased $41 million or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily due to higher Government Systems and Information Management Services sales. Income from continuing operations increased $36 million or 20%, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.30 or 23% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense that was favorably impacted by the release of the valuation allowance related to a capital loss carryforward, as well as higher pretax earnings from the higher sales.
As we turn to Slide 4, Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $612 million in the quarter, about flat with the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $6 million or 2% to $367 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, lower product deliveries to a Chinese regional jet manufacturer and lower Airbus A330 production rates. This was mostly offset by higher deliveries that support the A350 and 787 production rate ramps, favorable customer timing for airline selectable equipment, higher Bombardier C-Series sales in support of its entry into service this year and higher customer-funded development program revenues. Aftermarket sales increased $11 million or 5%, due to higher simulation of deliveries, inorganic sales from the acquisition of International Communications Group and higher flight deck retrofits, partially offset by lower Spira provisioning and lower capital retrofits.
On Commercial Systems, operating earnings were flat at $141 million and operating earnings were about flat at 23%. Operating earnings and margins were flat with the prior year, as benefits from the cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans were offset by unfavorable sales mix as lower margin customer-funded development sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased.
Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems overall revenue increased by 5% to $555 million driven by higher fix wing platform revenues and higher simulation training sales, partially offset by lower deliveries of various's rotary wing platforms, the wind down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international deliveries of targeting systems. 
Government Systems third quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $115 million, resulting in an operating margin of 20.7%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of the prior year. The increased operating earnings resulted from the higher sales volume and cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans, partially offset by unfavorable development program adjustments.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services sales increased 10% over the prior year, as commercial and Business Aviation services sales increased 9%, while the non-aviation related businesses increased 11%, primarily due to higher airport and rail program sales. Information management services third quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $26 million, resulting in operating margin of 15.6% compared to 15.1% in the third quarter of the last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings of the higher sales volume.
Looking next to Slide 7. We show year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $223 million of operating cash flow compared to $341 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted primarily from the timing of sales and lower advanced payments from our customers. These items were partially offset by lower tax payments.
Slide 8 provides an update to our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $731 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 to $741 million year-to-date in fiscal 2016. Company funded R&D decreased $47 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower Software Defined Radio development costs in Government Systems. Customer-funded research and development expense increased $25 million due to higher development costs for international regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems. Preproduction engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for certain military transport programs in Government Systems and the Global 7000, 8000 program, partially offset by lower spend on the C-Series program.
Moving to Slide 9. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase is primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first 3 quarters of the year had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the third quarter, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average cost of $90.71. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $125 million.
Now to move to Slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as we enter the last fiscal quarter of the year. Total sales are now expected to be about $5.3 billion, which is the bottom of the previously guided range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. As Kelly discussed in his opening remarks, we have updated Commercial Systems sales to be down about percentage point this year due to softness in business jet OEM deliveries, as well as muted market conditions in air transport service and support. We have narrowed the earnings per share guidance to 5 50 to 5 55, which is within the previously guided range of 5 45 to 5 65.
We have also updated our cash flow from operations outlook to be about $750 million, which is the bottom of the previously guided range, due primarily to the timing of receivable collections and higher preproduction engineering spend. Our guidance for total segment operating margins, research and development of investment and capital expenditures is unchanged from the previous guidance. 
With that, that's the end of my review of the financial results and projection. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

And there have been puts and takes, both positive and negative. I think we're in the short term, dealing with a lot of the negative, which is delays in entry in the service of programs, lower aftermarket MRO component than we originally expected and a much, much weaker Business Aviation demand than we anticipated. On the positive side, we gained additional share on the 777X. We've seen increases in production rates in there about a the aircraft, significant increases in production rates on narrow-body aircraft. Of course, we've got the new, a lot of new positions with the Mac's and the 777X are petting in. That's not necessarily new, but continue to be growth drivers for us. And then we planned our defense business at that time at a sequester level. And currently, the budget environment is clearly better than that. So our ability to grow from -- for our government business is certainly a little bit better. I think the -- as I look at that outlook and how we're doing against it, obviously, '16, we're not achieving that top level numbers. '17, I think we're going to take a hard look at Business Aviation. It's the wildcard for us. If we can just get that business to stabilize, I think we can grow the company. If you put that in perspective, Business Aviation OEM is about 20% to 25% of our commercial revenues are about 10% of that company revenues. And so when we can get to flat, we can grow the company. The challenge is quarters like this one, where we've got 22% decline in Business Aviation, is offsetting a lot of really good growth for us. And the information management business, I think continues to track pretty well to our original plan."

I'm probably not going to be providing you much detailed information as highly competitive between now and the down selection. So I'm not going to be speaking too much anymore about what's going on relative to Manpack. We do expect the down select to be towards the end of the second quarter or early third quarter of next fiscal year. As far as government programs, if you look in the third quarter, we saw some pretty good growth in military simulation and training. Our E6 program had some good growth and international PIII is also. We saw continued decline year-on-year in rotary wing, primarily driven by the oil and gas challenges that we've been dealing with. If you look towards the fourth quarter, I think you're going to see pretty good growth across our entire government portfolio. And in fact, I think our come that portfolio probably exceed our avionics portfolio in terms of overall growth, where key programs there are, our international C-130s. We've done a good job of booking those. You may have seen a press release where we won a Black Hawk simulator program down in Mexico. That was one of those that we had planned to win and convert in the year. We've got growth in F35, continued growth in E6, and then some simulation and training products that we're expecting to grow. So again, a pretty big fourth quarter, abnormally big fourth quarter for us in our government portfolio, but pretty much the majority of that is booked and now executing. And I expect that we'll have a really bang up quarter here for our government business, which is good. This is the first -- this Q3 was the first quarter of growth in quite a few quarters here for our government business. So it's good to get that finally turning in the right direction."

This was really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses.Among the market highlights was the CSeries entry",871,"Well, thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. This was really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses.
Among the market highlights was the CSeries entry into service with Swiss Air. We're very pleased to see Bombardier accomplish this major milestone, and it's a real sign that this program is turning the quarter. As you know, this has been a big investment for us, and we're all pleased to be moving from the investment phase to the return phase for this program.
Another major OEM accomplishment was the successful refueling test with the KC-46 tanker, paving the way towards production of that airplane. These are both important programs for our long-term growth in our commercial and government businesses. Annually, both Boeing and Airbus survey the airlines to gauge their supplier performance and customer support. And recently, it was announced that Rockwell Collins was ranked #1 for both Airbus and Boeing. In fact, we're ranked ahead both of the OEMs themselves. I'm very proud of our team's performance, which is a testament to our brand promise of building trust every day, and it will help us to continue to be the supplier of choice in our markets.
Overall, we executed our business quite well during the quarter, delivering solid margin performance, while also stepping up our R&D spending in Commercial Systems to support the development of the 777X. We also made great progress in booking the government orders necessary to achieve our abnormally large second-half sales plan. And our IMS business grew 10%, and we achieved our expected growth in the non-aviation segment, which demonstrates that some of our strategies to grow that portion of the business are beginning to take traction.
Now we're not without challenges, and they seem to be focused in our Commercial Systems markets right now. The Business Aviation and market continues to struggle to find the bottom. This last quarter, we saw shaky utilization, and recently, we've seen even further declines in demand from the OEMs. If you recall, we started the year with some discount in OEM production, and we saw reduced demand at the beginning of the calendar year, which used up our discount and then some. I was hoping to see demand stabilize through the summer, but unfortunately, this hasn't been the case. This is going to further impact our top line in Commercial Systems. Just to give you some color on this. It's not really specific to any particular airplane type, but rather an overall market condition.
We're seeing softness in product demand across all major business jet manufacturers. Recall that we moved our fiscal 2016 guidance back to the fourth quarter earnings call to allow us to get better aligned with the OEMs, and I think this is going to be really applicable to the bizjet demand this year. It's not yet clear to us how these latest changes from the OEMs will impact their 2017 demand. And I'm sure that they're going to be monitoring the next quarter of market dynamics before they set that outlook.
In addition, we've had another quarter of no growth in air transport MRO. And in the last earnings call, I indicated that I believe this is a structural change to our aftermarket due to the component recycling practices at the airlines. So if you couple the Business Aviation OEM and the air transport aftermarket sales environments, we're lowering our Commercial Systems sales forecast for the year from up single-digits to down about 1%.
On a more positive note, as I mentioned earlier, Government Systems had a nice quarter in sales and earnings, but has an even bigger fourth quarter yet to go. And as I've done in the last couple calls, I'd like to give you some granularity on how we're progressing in capturing the business to achieve that growth.
During the last quarterly call, I said that 77% of the second half growth was either in backlog or coming from annual follow-on buys. This is now at 94% at the end of the third quarter. So I remain very confident in our ability to achieve the sales growth that we projected and finished the year strong.
Some of these sales will be later in the year than we originally planned, and it's going to stress our ability to collect cash by year-end, and that's a contributor to us adjusting our guidance on cash flow to lower end of our previous range. 
So to summarize before Patrick takes you through the details of the quarter, we really executed well this past quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see the restructuring savings flowing as we expected, and we are successfully bringing in the government business needed to accomplish the abnormally large second half ramp. Business Aviation remains a challenge for us as the industry is still searching for the bottom of the market. And I continue to see good things from our IMS business, and we're making good progress on the new OEM programs that will set us up for future growth.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details."
603843,368020381,1011367,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slide that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sal",1110,"Thanks, Kelly, and morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slide that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.
Total company sales for the quarter increased $41 million or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily due to higher Government Systems and Information Management Services sales. Income from continuing operations increased $36 million or 20%, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.30 or 23% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense that was favorably impacted by the release of the valuation allowance related to a capital loss carryforward as well as higher pretax earnings from the higher sales.
As we turn to Slide 4. Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $612 million in the quarter, about flat with the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $6 million or 2% to $367 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, lower product deliveries to a Chinese regional jet manufacturer and lower Airbus A330 production rates. This was mostly offset by higher deliveries that supported the A350 and 787 production rate ramps, favorable customer timing for airline selectable equipment, higher Bombardier CSeries sales in support of its entry into service this year and higher customer-funded development program revenues. Aftermarket sales increased $11 million or 5% due to higher simulation hardware deliveries, inorganic sales from the acquisition of International Communications Group and higher flight deck retrofits, partially offset by lower spares provisioning and lower cabin retrofits.
On Commercial Systems, operating earnings were flat at $141 million, and operating earnings (sic) [ margins ] were about flat at 23%. Operating earnings and margins were flat with the prior year as benefits from the cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans were offset by unfavorable sales mix as lower margin customer-funded development sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased.
Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems overall revenue increased by 5% to $555 million, driven by higher fixed-wing platform revenues and higher simulation training sales, partially offset by lower deliveries of various rotary wind platforms, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international deliveries of targeting systems.
Government Systems third quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $115 million, resulting in an operating margin of 20.7%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of the prior year. The increased operating earnings resulted from the higher sales volume and cost saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans, partially offset by unfavorable development program adjustments.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services' sales increased 10% over the prior year as commercial and Business Aviation services' sales increased 9%, while the non-aviation-related businesses increased 11%, primarily due to higher airport and rail program sales. Information Management Services' third quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $26 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.6% compared to 15.1% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings from higher sales volume.
Looking next to Slide 7. We show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $223 million of operating cash flow compared to $341 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted primarily from the timing of sales and lower advance payments from our customers. These items were partially offset by lower tax payments.
Slide 8 provides an update to our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $731 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 to $741 million year-to-date in fiscal 2016. Company funded R&D decreased $47 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower software-defined radio development costs in Government Systems. Customer funded research and development expense increased $25 million due to higher development costs for international regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems. Preproduction engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for certain military transport programs in Government Systems and the Global 7000/8000 program, partially offset by lower spend on the CSeries program.
Moving to Slide 9. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first 3 quarters of the year had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the third quarter, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average cost of $90.71. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $125 million.
Now to move to Slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as we enter the last fiscal quarter of the year. Total sales are now expected to be about $5.3 billion, which is the bottom of the previously guided range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. As Kelly discussed in his opening remarks, we have updated Commercial Systems sales to be down about percentage point this year due to softness in business jet OEM deliveries as well as muted market conditions in air transport service and support. We have narrowed the earnings per share guidance to $5.50 to $5.55, which is within the previously guided range of $5.45 to $5.65.
We have also updated our cash flow from operations outlook to be about $750 million, which is the bottom of the previously guided range, due primarily to the timing of receivable collections and higher preproduction engineering spend. Our guidance for total segment operating margins, research and development investment and capital expenditures is unchanged from the previous guidance.
With that, that's the end of my review of the financial results and projection. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

And there have been puts and takes, both positive and negative. I think we're, in the short term, dealing with a lot of the negative, which is delays in entry into service programs, lower aftermarket MRO component than we originally expected and a much, much weaker business aviation demand than we anticipated. On the positive side, we gained additional share on the 777X. We've seen increases in production rates in narrow-body aircraft, significant increases in production rates on narrow-body aircraft. Of course, we've got the new -- a lot of new positions with the MAX and the 777X are petting in. That's not necessarily new, but continue to be growth drivers for us. And then we planned our defense business at that time at a sequester level, and currently, the budget environment is clearly better than that. So our ability to grow from -- for our government business is certainly a little bit better. I think the -- as I look at that outlook and how we're doing against it, obviously, '16, we're not achieving the top level numbers. '17, I think we're going to have to take a hard look at Business Aviation. It's the wildcard for us. If we can just get that business to stabilize, I think we can grow the company. If you put in perspective, Business Aviation OEM is about 20% to 25% of our commercial revenues are about 10% of that company revenues. And so when we can get to flat, we can grow the company. The challenge is quarters like this one, where we've got 22% decline in Business Aviation, is offsetting a lot of really good growth for us.

So we'll tend to mute themselves in fiscal '17, but then we'll see the incremental growth in '18 and '19 as we continue to feather in the MAX. I think we're all watching Airbus' ramp-up on A350. Right now, we're pretty well aligned with their public guidance there. But I think everybody is watching to see if they're going to be able to achieve that going forward.

So I'm not going to be speaking too much of anymore about what's going on relative to Manpack. We do expect the downselect to be towards the end of the second quarter or early third quarter of next fiscal year. As far as government programs, if you look in the third quarter, we saw some pretty good growth in military simulation and training. Our E-6 program had some good growth and international PIII [ph] also. We saw continued decline year-on-year in rotary wing, primarily driven by the oil and gas challenges that we've been dealing with. If you look towards the fourth quarter, I think you're going to see pretty good growth across our entire government portfolio. And in fact, I think our COM/NAV portfolio will probably exceed our Avionics portfolio in terms of overall growth, where key programs there are, international C-130s, and we've done a good job of booking those. You may have seen a press release where we won a Blackhawk simulator program down in Mexico. That was one of those that we had planned to win and convert in the year. We've got growth in F-35, continued growth in  E-6 and then some simulation and training products that we're expecting to grow. So again, a pretty big fourth quarter, abnormally big fourth quarter for us in our government portfolio. But pretty much the majority of that is booked and now executing. And I expect that we'll have a really bang up quarter here for our government business, which is good. This is the first -- this Q3 was the first quarter of growth in quite a few quarters here for our government business. So it's good to get that finally turning in the right direction."

Probably, the first area that we're making progress in that is in the rail business, where we're providing positive train control, software as a service. We've got that now into the market and we're starting to transition. This isn't going to be a sw",247,"Yes. Probably, the first area that we're making progress in that is in the rail business, where we're providing positive train control, software as a service. We've got that now into the market and we're starting to transition. This isn't going to be a switch to where one day, we just flip over and then we move from project to do a subscription revenue. But I think in both the airport business and the rail security business, we'll be able to move to more subscription base over the next several years. I think you ought to continue to view this though as it's project based, at least in the near term, it's going to be project-based and tend to be a little bit more lumpy in terms of overall timing. But I'm pleased some of our investment strategies that we put in place, particularly in the airports area, have started to bear fruit. We've got growth this quarter, I'm expecting that will grow again that segment of the business in the next quarter. So I think we've got some good plans to get the trajectory of that. So it is not offsetting the good growth that we've consistently seen in the core aviation. Also remember that it is less profitable than the core aviation component to the business. So I don't think we're going to see significant changes in the overall profitability of that segment. The incremental margin performance really comes out of the core aviation growth."

This was really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses.Among the market highlights was the CSeries entry",872,"Well, thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. This was really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses.
Among the market highlights was the CSeries entry into service with Swiss Air. We're very pleased to see Bombardier accomplish this major milestone, and it's a real sign that this program is turning the corner. As you know, this has been a big investment for us, and we're all pleased to be moving from the investment phase to the return phase for this program.
Another major OEM accomplishment was the successful refueling test with the KC-46 tanker; paving the way towards production of that airplane. These are both important programs for our long-term growth in our commercial and government businesses. Annually, both Boeing and Airbus surveyed the airlines to gauge their supplier performance and customer support. And recently, it was announced that Rockwell Collins was ranked #1 for both Airbus and Boeing. In fact, we're ranked ahead of both of the OEMs themselves. I'm very proud of our team's performance, which is a testament to our brand promise of building trust every day, and will help us to continue to be the supplier of choice in our markets.
Overall, we executed our business quite well during the quarter, delivering solid margin performance, while also stepping up our R&D spending in Commercial Systems to support the development of the 777X. We also made great progress in booking the government orders necessary to achieve our abnormally large second-half sales plan. And our IMS business grew 10%, and we achieved our expected growth in the non-aviation segment, which demonstrates that some of our strategies to grow that portion of the business are beginning to take traction.
Now we're not without challenges, and they seem to be focused in our Commercial Systems markets right now. The Business Aviation end market continues to struggle to find the bottom. This last quarter, we saw shaky utilization, and recently, we've seen even further declines in demand from the OEMs. If you recall, we started the year with some discount in OEM production, and we saw reduced demand at the beginning of the calendar year, which used up our discount and then some. I was hoping to see demand stabilize through the summer, but unfortunately, this hasn't been the case. This is going to further impact our top line in Commercial Systems. Just to give you some color on this. It's not really specific to any particular airplane type, but rather an overall market condition.
We're seeing softness in product demand across all major business jet manufacturers. Recall that we moved our fiscal 2016 guidance back to the fourth quarter earnings call to allow us to get better aligned with the OEMs, and I think this is going to be really applicable to the bizjet demand this year. It's not yet clear to us how these latest changes from the OEMs will impact their 2017 demand. And I'm sure that they're going to be monitoring the next quarter of market dynamics before they set that outlook.
In addition, we've had another quarter of no growth in air transport MRO. And in the last earnings call, I indicated that I believe this is a structural change to our aftermarket due to the component recycling practices at the airlines. So if you couple the Business Aviation OEM and the air transport aftermarket sales environments, we're lowering our Commercial Systems sales forecast for the year from up single-digits to down about 1%.
On a more positive note, as I mentioned earlier, Government Systems had a nice quarter in sales and earnings, but has an even bigger fourth quarter yet to go. And as I've done in the last couple calls, I'd like to give you some granularity on how we're progressing in capturing the business to achieve that growth.
During the last quarterly call, I said that 77% of the second half growth was either in backlog or coming from annual follow-on buys. This is now at 94% at the end of the third quarter. So I remain very confident in our ability to achieve the sales growth that we projected and finish the year strong.
Some of these sales will be later in the year than we originally planned, and it's going to stress our ability to collect cash by year-end, and that's a contributor to us adjusting our guidance on cash flow to the lower end of our previous range. 
So to summarize before Patrick takes you through the details of the quarter, we really executed well this past quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see the restructuring savings flowing as we expected, and we are successfully bringing in the government business needed to accomplish the abnormally large second half ramp. Business Aviation remains a challenge for us as the industry is still searching for the bottom of the market. And I continue to see good things from our IMS business, and we're making good progress on the new OEM programs that will set us up for future growth.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details."

I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sa",1111,"Thanks, Kelly, and morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.
Total company sales for the quarter increased $41 million or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily due to higher Government Systems and Information Management Services sales. Income from continuing operations increased $36 million or 20%, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.30 or 23% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense that was favorably impacted by the release of a valuation allowance related to a capital loss carryforward as well as higher pretax earnings from the higher sales.
As we turn to Slide 4. Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $612 million in the quarter, about flat with the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $6 million or 2% to $367 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, lower product deliveries to a Chinese regional jet manufacturer and lower Airbus A330 production rates. This was mostly offset by higher deliveries in support of the A350 and 787 production rate ramps, favorable customer timing for airline selectable equipment, higher Bombardier CSeries sales in support of its entry into service this year and higher customer-funded development program revenues. Aftermarket sales increased $11 million or 5% due to higher simulation hardware deliveries, inorganic sales from the acquisition of International Communications Group and higher flight deck retrofits, partially offset by lower spares provisioning and lower cabin retrofits.
On Commercial Systems, operating earnings were flat at $141 million, and operating earnings (sic) [ margins ] were about flat at 23%. Operating earnings and margins were flat with the prior year as benefits from the cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans were offset by unfavorable sales mix as lower margin customer-funded development sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased.
Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems overall revenue increased by 5% to $555 million, driven by higher fixed-wing platform revenues and higher simulation training sales, partially offset by lower deliveries of various rotary wind platforms, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international deliveries of targeting systems.
Government Systems third quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $115 million, resulting in an operating margin of 20.7%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of the prior year. The increased operating earnings resulted from the higher sales volume and cost saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans, partially offset by unfavorable development program adjustments.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services' sales increased 10% over the prior year as commercial and Business Aviation services' sales increased 9%, while the non-aviation-related businesses increased 11%, primarily due to higher airport and rail program sales. Information Management Services' third quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $26 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.6% compared to 15.1% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings from higher sales volume.
Looking next to Slide 7. We show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $223 million of operating cash flow compared to $341 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted primarily from the timing of sales and lower advance payments from our customers. These items were partially offset by lower tax payments.
Slide 8 provides an update to our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $731 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 to $741 million year-to-date in fiscal 2016. Company funded R&D decreased $47 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower software-defined radio development costs in Government Systems. Customer funded research and development expense increased $25 million due to higher development costs for international regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems. Preproduction engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for certain military transport programs in Government Systems and the Global 7000/8000 program, partially offset by lower spend on the CSeries program.
Moving to Slide 9. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first 3 quarters of the year had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the third quarter, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average cost of $90.71. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $125 million.
Now to move to Slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as we enter the last fiscal quarter of the year. Total sales are now expected to be about $5.3 billion, which is the bottom of the previously guided range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. As Kelly discussed in his opening remarks, we have updated Commercial Systems sales to be down about 1% this year due to softness in business jet OEM deliveries as well as muted market conditions in air transport service and support. We have narrowed the earnings per share guidance to $5.50 to $5.55, which is within the previously guided range of $5.45 to $5.65.
We have also updated our cash flow from operations outlook to be about $750 million, which is at the bottom of the previously guided range, due primarily to the timing of receivable collections and higher preproduction engineering spend. Our guidance for total segment operating margins, research and development investment and capital expenditures is unchanged from the previous guidance.
With that, that's the end of my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

And there have been puts and takes, both positive and negative. I think we're, in the short term, dealing with a lot of the negative; which is delays in entry into service programs, lower aftermarket MRO component than we originally expected and a much, much weaker business aviation demand than we anticipated. On the positive side, we gained additional share on the 777X. We've seen increases in production rates in narrow-body aircraft -- significant increases in production rates on narrow-body aircraft. Of course, we've got the new -- a lot of new positions with the MAX and the 777X cutting in. That's not necessarily new, but continue to be growth drivers for us. And then we planned our defense business at that time at a sequester level, and currently, the budget environment is clearly better than that. So our ability to grow from -- for our government business is certainly a little bit better. I think the -- as I look at that outlook and how we're doing against it, obviously, '16, we're not achieving the top level numbers. '17, I think we're going to have to take a hard look at Business Aviation; it's the wildcard for us. If we can just get that business to stabilize, I think we can grow the company. If you put in perspective, Business Aviation OEM is about 20% to 25% of our commercial revenues or about 10% of that company revenues. And so when we can get to flat, we can grow the company. The challenge is quarters like this one, where we've got 22% decline in Business Aviation, is offsetting a lot of really good growth for us. And the information management business, I think, continues to track pretty well to our original plan."

So I'm not going to be speaking too much of anymore about what's going on relative to Manpack. We do expect the down select to be towards the end of the second quarter or early third quarter of next fiscal year. As far as government programs, if you look in the third quarter, we saw some pretty good growth in military simulation and training. Our E-6 program had some good growth and international P-3s [ph] also. We saw continued decline year-on-year in rotary wing, primarily driven by the oil and gas challenges that we've been dealing with. If you look towards the fourth quarter, I think you're going to see pretty good growth across our entire government portfolio. And in fact, I think our COM/NAV portfolio will probably exceed our Avionics portfolio in terms of overall growth; where key programs there are international C-130s; and we've done a good job of booking those. You may have seen a press release where we won a Blackhawk simulator program down in Mexico. That was one of those that we had planned to win and convert in the year. We've got growth in F-35, continued growth in  E-6 and then some simulation and training products that we're expecting to grow. So again, a pretty big fourth quarter -- abnormally big fourth quarter for us in our government portfolio. But pretty much the majority of that is booked and now executing. And I expect that we'll have a really bang up quarter here for our government business, which is good. This is the first -- this Q3 was the first quarter of growth in quite a few quarters here for our government business. So it's good to get that finally turning in the right direction."

We've got that now into the market and we're starting to transition. This isn't going to be a switch to where one day, we just flip over and that we move from project to subscription revenue. But I think in both the airport business and the rail security business, we'll be able to move to more subscription base over the next several years. I think you ought to continue to view this though as it's project based, at least in the near term. It's going to be project-based and tend to be a little bit more lumpy in terms of overall timing. But I'm pleased some of our investment strategies that we put in place, particularly in the airports area, have started to bear fruit. We've got growth this quarter. I'm expecting that will grow again, that segment of the business in the next quarter. So I think we've got some good plans to get the trajectory of that. So it is not offsetting the good growth that we've consistently seen in the core aviation. Also remember that it is less profitable than the core aviation component to the business. So I don't think we're going to see significant changes in the overall profitability of that segment. The incremental margin performance really comes out of the core aviation growth."

This was really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses.Among the market highlights was the CSeries entry",872,"Well, thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. This was really a solid quarter for us as we saw some major accomplishments in our markets and also had good execution performance in all of our businesses.
Among the market highlights was the CSeries entry into service with Swiss Air. We're very pleased to see Bombardier accomplish this major milestone, and it's a real sign that this program is turning the corner. As you know, this has been a big investment for us, and we're all pleased to be moving from the investment phase to the return phase for this program.
Another major OEM accomplishment was the successful refueling test with the KC-46 tanker; paving the way towards production of that airplane. These are both important programs for our long-term growth in our commercial and government businesses. Annually, both Boeing and Airbus surveyed the airlines to gauge their supplier performance and customer support. And recently, it was announced that Rockwell Collins was ranked #1 for both Airbus and Boeing. In fact, we're ranked ahead of both of the OEMs themselves. I'm very proud of our team's performance, which is a testament to our brand promise of building trust every day, and will help us to continue to be the supplier of choice in our markets.
Overall, we executed our business quite well during the quarter, delivering solid margin performance, while also stepping up our R&D spending in Commercial Systems to support the development of the 777X. We also made great progress in booking the government orders necessary to achieve our abnormally large second-half sales plan. And our IMS business grew 10%, and we achieved our expected growth in the non-aviation segment, which demonstrates that some of our strategies to grow that portion of the business are beginning to take traction.
Now we're not without challenges, and they seem to be focused in our Commercial Systems markets right now. The Business Aviation end market continues to struggle to find the bottom. This last quarter, we saw shaky utilization, and recently, we've seen even further declines in demand from the OEMs. If you recall, we started the year with some discount in OEM production, and we saw reduced demand at the beginning of the calendar year, which used up our discount and then some. I was hoping to see demand stabilize through the summer, but unfortunately, this hasn't been the case. This is going to further impact our top line in Commercial Systems. Just to give you some color on this. It's not really specific to any particular airplane type, but rather an overall market condition.
We're seeing softness in product demand across all major business jet manufacturers. Recall that we moved our fiscal 2016 guidance back to the fourth quarter earnings call to allow us to get better aligned with the OEMs, and I think this is going to be really applicable to the bizjet demand this year. It's not yet clear to us how these latest changes from the OEMs will impact their 2017 demand. And I'm sure that they're going to be monitoring the next quarter of market dynamics before they set that outlook.
In addition, we've had another quarter of no growth in air transport MRO. And in the last earnings call, I indicated that I believe this is a structural change to our aftermarket due to the component recycling practices at the airlines. So if you couple the Business Aviation OEM and the air transport aftermarket sales environments, we're lowering our Commercial Systems sales forecast for the year from up single-digits to down about 1%.
On a more positive note, as I mentioned earlier, Government Systems had a nice quarter in sales and earnings, but has an even bigger fourth quarter yet to go. And as I've done in the last couple calls, I'd like to give you some granularity on how we're progressing in capturing the business to achieve that growth.
During the last quarterly call, I said that 77% of the second half growth was either in backlog or coming from annual follow-on buys. This is now at 94% at the end of the third quarter. So I remain very confident in our ability to achieve the sales growth that we projected and finish the year strong.
Some of these sales will be later in the year than we originally planned, and it's going to stress our ability to collect cash by year-end, and that's a contributor to us adjusting our guidance on cash flow to the lower end of our previous range. 
So to summarize before Patrick takes you through the details of the quarter, we really executed well this past quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see the restructuring savings flowing as we expected, and we are successfully bringing in the government business needed to accomplish the abnormally large second half ramp. Business Aviation remains a challenge for us as the industry is still searching for the bottom of the market. And I continue to see good things from our IMS business, and we're making good progress on the new OEM programs that will set us up for future growth.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Patrick to walk us through the quarterly details."
603843,368020381,1011588,"Rockwell Collins Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thanks, Kelly, and morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sa",1112,"Thanks, Kelly, and morning to everyone as well. I'd now like to walk you through today's presentation slides that summarize our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. I'll begin on Slide 3, where we highlight our total company third quarter sales, earnings per share, income from continuing operations and shares outstanding.
Total company sales for the quarter increased $41 million or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily due to higher Government Systems and Information Management Services sales. Income from continuing operations increased $36 million or 20%, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.30 or 23% compared to the same period last year. The increase in income and earnings per share from continuing operations was primarily due to lower income tax expense that was favorably impacted by the release of a valuation allowance related to a capital loss carryforward as well as higher pretax earnings from the higher sales.
As we turn to Slide 4. Commercial Systems achieved revenue of $612 million in the quarter, about flat with the same period last year. Sales related to aircraft OEMs decreased $6 million or 2% to $367 million, primarily due to lower business jet aircraft OEM production rates, lower product deliveries to a Chinese regional jet manufacturer and lower Airbus A330 production rates. This was mostly offset by higher deliveries in support of the A350 and 787 production rate ramps, favorable customer timing for airline selectable equipment, higher Bombardier CSeries sales in support of its entry into service this year and higher customer-funded development program revenues. Aftermarket sales increased $11 million or 5% due to higher simulation hardware deliveries, inorganic sales from the acquisition of International Communications Group and higher flight deck retrofits, partially offset by lower spares provisioning and lower cabin retrofits.
On Commercial Systems, operating earnings were flat at $141 million, and operating earnings (sic) [ margins ] were about flat at 23%. Operating earnings and margins were flat with the prior year as benefits from the cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans were offset by unfavorable sales mix as lower margin customer-funded development sales increased and higher-margin business jet OEM sales decreased.
Moving on to Slide 5. Government Systems overall revenue increased by 5% to $555 million, driven by higher fixed-wing platform revenues and higher simulation training sales, partially offset by lower deliveries of various rotary wind platforms, the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international deliveries of targeting systems.
Government Systems third quarter operating earnings increased $7 million to $115 million, resulting in an operating margin of 20.7%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of the prior year. The increased operating earnings resulted from the higher sales volume and cost saving initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans, partially offset by unfavorable development program adjustments.
Turning to Slide 6. Information Management Services' sales increased 10% over the prior year as commercial and Business Aviation services' sales increased 9%, while the non-aviation-related businesses increased 11%, primarily due to higher airport and rail program sales. Information Management Services' third quarter operating earnings increased $3 million to $26 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.6% compared to 15.1% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in operating earnings and margin was due to the incremental earnings from higher sales volume.
Looking next to Slide 7. We show our year-to-date results for revenue, income from continuing operations, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Through the third quarter, we generated $223 million of operating cash flow compared to $341 million last year. The decrease in cash generation resulted primarily from the timing of sales and lower advance payments from our customers. These items were partially offset by lower tax payments.
Slide 8 provides an update to our total R&D investment. Total spend decreased from $731 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2015 to $741 million year-to-date in fiscal 2016. Company funded R&D decreased $47 million due to lower business jet development cost in Commercial Systems and lower software-defined radio development costs in Government Systems. Customer funded research and development expense increased $25 million due to higher development costs for international regional jet development programs in Commercial Systems, partially offset by the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program in Government Systems. Preproduction engineering investment net increased due to higher costs incurred for certain military transport programs in Government Systems and the Global 7000/8000 program, partially offset by lower spend on the CSeries program.
Moving to Slide 9. We show the status of our capital structure as of the end of the third quarter compared to the end of last year. During the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2 from 1.7 at year-end. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper as the first 3 quarters of the year had typically light cash flows. I expect the level of debt to come down over the balance of the year as a larger portion of our cash flow is traditionally generated later in the year and we pay down a portion of that short-term debt.
The updated status of the share repurchase program as of the end of the quarter is detailed on Slide 10. During the third quarter, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average cost of $90.71. Our repurchase authority remaining at the end of the quarter was $125 million.
Now to move to Slide 11, where we provide a summary of our fiscal 2016 financial guidance, which has been updated as we enter the last fiscal quarter of the year. Total sales are now expected to be about $5.3 billion, which is the bottom of the previously guided range of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. As Kelly discussed in his opening remarks, we have updated Commercial Systems sales to be down about percentage point this year due to softness in business jet OEM deliveries as well as muted market conditions in air transport service and support. We have narrowed the earnings per share guidance to $5.50 to $5.55, which is within the previously guided range of $5.45 to $5.65.
We have also updated our cash flow from operations outlook to be about $750 million, which is at the bottom of the previously guided range, due primarily to the timing of receivable collections and higher preproduction engineering spend. Our guidance for total segment operating margins, research and development investment and capital expenditures is unchanged from the previous guidance.
With that, that's the end of my review of the financial results and projections. So Ryan, back to you to kick off the Q&A session."

Of course, we've got the new -- a lot of new positions with the MAX and the 777X cutting in. That's not necessarily new, but continue to be growth drivers for us. And then we planned our defense business at that time at a sequester level, and currently, the budget environment is clearly better than that. So our ability to grow from -- for our government business is certainly a little bit better. I think the -- as I look at that outlook and how we're doing against it, obviously, '16, we're not achieving the top level numbers. '17, I think we're going to have to take a hard look at Business Aviation; it's the wildcard for us. If we can just get that business to stabilize, I think we can grow the company. If you put in perspective, Business Aviation OEM is about 20% to 25% of our commercial revenues or about 10% of that company revenues. And so when we can get to flat, we can grow the company. The challenge is quarters like this one, where we've got 22% decline in Business Aviation, is offsetting a lot of really good growth for us. And the information management business, I think, continues to track pretty well to our original plan."

We do expect the down select to be towards the end of the second quarter or early third quarter of next fiscal year. As far as government programs, if you look in the third quarter, we saw some pretty good growth in military simulation and training. Our E-6 program had some good growth and international P-3s [ph] also. We saw continued decline year-on-year in rotary wing, primarily driven by the oil and gas challenges that we've been dealing with. If you look towards the fourth quarter, I think you're going to see pretty good growth across our entire government portfolio. And in fact, I think our COM/NAV portfolio will probably exceed our Avionics portfolio in terms of overall growth; where key programs there are international C-130s; and we've done a good job of booking those. You may have seen a press release where we won a Blackhawk simulator program down in Mexico. That was one of those that we had planned to win and convert in the year. We've got growth in F-35, continued growth in  E-6 and then some simulation and training products that we're expecting to grow. So again, a pretty big fourth quarter -- abnormally big fourth quarter for us in our government portfolio. But pretty much the majority of that is booked and now executing.

We're actually expecting some initial revenues in both air transport and governments, bizjets, out of ADS-B here in the fourth quarter. So that's just picking up. But again, these are mandated with a particular time. So if they don't get them done during their normal scheduled maintenance, then they effectively have to take the airplanes down to do the mods.

But I think in both the airport business and the rail security business, we'll be able to move to more subscription base over the next several years. I think you ought to continue to view this though as it's project based, at least in the near term. It's going to be project-based and tend to be a little bit more lumpy in terms of overall timing. But I'm pleased some of our investment strategies that we put in place, particularly in the airports area, have started to bear fruit. We've got growth this quarter. I'm expecting that will grow again, that segment of the business in the next quarter. So I think we've got some good plans to get the trajectory of that. So it is not offsetting the good growth that we've consistently seen in the core aviation. Also remember that it is less profitable than the core aviation component to the business. So I don't think we're going to see significant changes in the overall profitability of that segment. The incremental margin performance really comes out of the core aviation growth."

And that's part of our planning process, as we're in the middle of that right now. I think, particularly around the manufacturing, if we're not going to be delivering as much in Business Aviation, we're going to have to really take a hard look at our overall cost structure around that, especially if we don't see signs that this is temporary. If this is a long-term phenomenon, which right now, it looks like, I think we've got to make sure we've got the overall cost base pretty well sized. I think you can look from historically, we're pretty aggressive in that regard. We'll take all the action we need to make sure we stay lean and mean, in spite of challenging market conditions."

I am very pleased to be speaking with you today about the transformative and complementary acquisition of B/E Aerospace. This transaction brings together 2 industry leading franchises with significant benefits to Rockwell Collins. It strengthens our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions, increasing our scale and establishing a new platform of growth for our company. 
The addition of B/E will also diversify and balance our portfolio across OEM, airline and aftermarket. And as we look to the future, it enhances our ability to integrate cabin equipment using smart technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance the experience of passengers and airline personnel. 
From a financial perspective, this combination is very attractive to both company shareowners. We project run rate pretax cost synergies of $160 million along with meaningful revenue synergies, which I'll discuss later in the call. Additionally, we expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year and combined 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion. The acquisition of B/E Aerospace is consistent with our vision to be the most trusted source of aviation and high-integrity solutions in the world.
Before I ask Amin to make a few comments, let me just say a few quick words about our earnings, which were also announced yesterday. We had a strong quarter of operational performance, highlighted by double-digit earnings per share growth and robust quarterly free cash flow generation. This gives us a great momentum headed into 2017. Over the long term, we're well-positioned to deliver accelerating top line revenue growth, double-digit earnings per share and strong cash flow growth. Patrick Allen is going to discuss our fourth quarter earnings results and our 2017 guidance later on in the call, but let me turn back to the transaction.
I'd like to thank B/E Aerospace's Founder and Chairman, Amin Khoury, for being here with me today. As you can imagine, to put together a deal like this, we've come to know each other and our respective companies quite well. We could not have found a better partner in B/E Aerospace, and I can't tell you -- I can tell you that on behalf of the nearly 20,000 employees at Rockwell Collins, we can't wait to bring them to the Rockwell Collins family.
Today's a big day for Amin. As Founder of B/E, he's achieved an extraordinary feat that we should all admire, from creating a small business with $3 million in revenues in 1987 to a global powerhouse of almost $3 billion today, and a leader in the markets -- all the markets that they serve. Very impressive. Congratulations, Amin, and I'd like to ask you to say a few words."

Thank you very much for your kind remarks. But obviously, it's no longer about me. It's about the wonderful benefit that this combination brings our customers and our employees and our shareholders.
Our combination with Rockwell Collins represents an excellent outcome for B/E Aerospace's stockholders, who will receive an immediate premium as well as a substantial equity interest in a strong combined company; broader range of products, customers; and the combined expertise and resources to create real and meaningful future value. We feel confident that this combination delivers significant long-term benefits neither company could realize on its own. We look forward to becoming part of Rockwell Collins and leveraging their technology to accelerate our long-term growth as we embark on the next chapter in the company's history. 
The opportunities available to us working together are boundless. We will truly be the premier supplier of front and back of aircraft products and will build on our deep customer relationships. For me personally, I can retire knowing that B/E Aerospace is in Kelly Ortberg's extremely capable hands, with Werner Lieberherr continuing to get the business while leveraging the full resources of Rockwell Collins. 
This transaction delivers great benefits to all of our constituencies. Our shareholders will realize significant and immediate value in the form of a 23% current premium to B/E's closing stock price on Friday and expected substantial equity upside in the combined company. Our customers will enjoy access to a greater breadth of products, technologies and the global scale and combined expertise continue serving their evolving needs. Our employees will have greater opportunities as part of a larger, more diversified company with enhanced opportunities for professional growth and advancement across Rockwell Collins' global platform. 
Importantly, having worked with Kelly and his team very closely throughout this process, I can assure you that Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace share the same cultural values, commitment to customers, focus on innovation, quality and sustained customer value. Rockwell Collins is acquiring a company that is in great shape. While I will not spend time on this call discussing earnings, we released our third quarter results yesterday. We recorded another outstanding quarter and we raised guidance for 2016. 
In sum, this is a tremendous opportunity for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins shareholders to participate in the long-term value-creation opportunity that neither company is able to achieve on its own. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Kelly."

Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. B/E Aerospace shareowners will receive consideration of $34.10 per share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock or each B/E Aerospace share they own, representing a value of $62 per share, subject to a 7.5% collar. B/E Aerospace shareowners will own approximately 20% of Rockwell Collins following the completion of the transaction.
B/E Aerospace will operate as a new aircraft interior systems segment within Rockwell Collins and will continue to be run by Werner Lieberherr and B/E's proven management team. The transaction is expected to close in the spring of 2017 on the completion of regulatory approvals and approval of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace shareowners as well as other customary closing conditions.
Now turning to Slide 5. I want to provide a bit more detail regarding the strategic and financial rationale for this transaction. This acquisition is the result of a multi-year strategic process we undertook to determine how best to grow our company. This included the formation of a new strategic and financial committee of our board. 
We looked at 2 major alternatives: One was to take our capabilities into new markets and the other was to expand our capabilities into our current market channels. And we selected this path and developed some criteria of technical differentiation, long-life cycle, and market leadership.
B/E Aerospace is a terrific match. The combination solidifies our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions. We'll be able to broaden our offerings to customers throughout -- through an expansion of our traditional core business, while also strengthening and balancing our portfolio mix.
B/E Aerospace is a leader in nearly all the markets they serve, and similar to Rockwell Collins, has a repetition for innovation, quality and on-time delivery. B/E Aerospace also has a highly visible, long-cycle backlog. Beyond new aircraft deliveries, their $12 billion of installed base provides a strong flow of aftermarket retrofit opportunities that balances our current cyclical exposure to OEM production rates.
Now I touched on the combination benefits, but let me just quickly reiterate: We expect to generate approximately $160 million in projected pretax run rate cost [ph] synergies. We expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year. I believe that are meaningful revenue synergies that create significant uptick -- upside to this business case, and we expect 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion.
B/E Aerospace business will fit within Rockwell Collins as a separate segment as we have successfully done with the ARINC acquisition. This will assure no disruption to our customer commitment.
Now in addition to the compelling financial aspects that I outlined, the deal is structured to preserve a solid investment-grade rating, retain our dividend payout of approximately 25% of net income, it takes advantage of attractive credit markets and generates significantly greater value than alternative uses of capital, including share repurchases.
Moving on to Slide 6. For those of you who may not be as familiar with the B/E business, I want to give you an overview of B/E Aerospace. B/E is a leading provider of highly engineered, aviation-certified interior aircraft products. The company is a leader in all of its major product categories and has a blue chip customer base of airlines, commercial and biz jet OEMs, aircraft completion centers and leasing companies. And as I've mentioned, B/E has a high-quality backlog with multi-year visibility and a large installed base of over $12 billion that drives aftermarket retrofit demand. The company has about 10,000 employees who directly contribute to B/E Aerospace's success in the market and will be a great fit at Rockwell Collins, as we work together to build on our respective reputation.
Now looking at the right-hand side of the chart, you can see B/E Aerospace's breakdown of 2015 revenues by customer, by market and by segment. About 80% of its revenue is from the airline customers, 60% is line fit and 77% is within the commercial aircraft segment.
Now Slide 7 and 8 break down B/E's business by its commercial aircraft segment and business jet segment. Let's start with the commercial aircraft on Slide 7. You can see B/E's 4 key products in this segment are seating, galley inserts, oxygen and passenger service units, and interior structures. B/E is a product line leader, with strong share in first, business and premium economy and main cabin seating, and has won 40% to 50% of the business class and main cabin awards and orders over the past 2 years. 
B/E is also a product line leader in food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, referred to as galley inserts, and they have won 85% of the galley insert awards and orders over the past 2 years. They are the supplier of passenger oxygen systems for all Airbus and Boeing platforms currently in production. And finally, B/E is the supplier of Spacewall modular lavatory systems for the Boeing 737 aircraft. 
Turning now to Slide 8, let's take a look at B/E's business jet segment. Key products within this segment are super first class suites, business jet seating and interior lighting systems. B/E is a product line leader in bespoke customer super first class cabins. There, they were recently awarded a $260 million program for high-end suites, which sets a new industry standard and they have won more than 75% of super first class awards over the past couple of years. 
The company is a product line leader in all major seating categories including business jet, VIP aircraft and civilian helicopters. It is the sole source for Boeing 737 and Boeing 737 MAX cabin, cabin lighting and does retrofit lighting on a number of aircraft as well. 
Turning now to Slide 9. You can see the impressive combination of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace offering in the cockpit, cabin and aircraft exterior. The transaction broadens our portfolio with leading products in attractive segments that strengthens and broadens our airline relationships. With the addition of these capabilities, Rockwell Collins will have an increased ability to provide integrated offerings throughout the aircraft.
Turning now to Slide 10. As you can see, the company will be more diversified and in different ways than we are today. The combined company will have greater presence in the commercial air transport market. This will strengthen our aftermarket mix with more retrofit opportunities. And you can see in the diagram, our customer mix will be nicely balanced between U.S. and international. This transaction creates more resilient and diversified business, with greater earnings power and reduced volatility. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick Allen, and he's going to discuss the combined company's financial highlights. Patrick?"

Slide 11 shows the combined company's pro forma financials. As you can see, the combined company would have generated approximately $8.1 billion of revenue and $1.9 billion in EBITDA through the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. 
Both companies announced earnings results yesterday, so these are current numbers and do not reflect synergies in the combined earnings power of the 2 companies, which together, we expect will create significantly even greater value in the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and talk about some of those synergies. The transaction is expected to generate run rate pretax cost synergies of approximately $160 million, which translates to $125 million after-tax [ph] to do some of the synergies coming from favorable tax jurisdictions. In addition, we expect to make certain conforming purchase accounting adjustments, which will benefit earnings by $60 million to $90 million per year for about 6 years. 
The sources of the cost synergies will come from elimination of duplicate public company costs and headquarters consolidation, low-cost country manufacturing, supply chain savings, consolidation of IT systems and rationalization of our sales and customer support organization. We have a long history of successfully integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies, as you saw with our ARINC acquisition, and we have established a very clear path to realizing these savings.
Additionally, significant revenue synergies exist, which Kelly will talk about in more detail, but are not included and represent upside to our business case. The cost to achieve these synergies is about $120 million, the bulk of which will be incurred over the next 3 years.
Slide 13 provide some additional color about our near-term capital deployment. As always, we will continue to invest in organic growth. We will continue investing in research and development, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales of the combined organization. We plan to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to deleverage, and we expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be under 3 within 2 years. We plan to structure our financing with a $1.5 billion, 3-year, prepayable term loan to facilitate this plan.
And we remain focused on shareholder return. We plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income. We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes, we expect to resume our normal share repurchase program. And we're committed to maintaining strong liquidity and flexibility, and preserving an investment-grade rating, which we currently expect to be a solid BBB.
Now let me quickly summarize our earning results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on the following slides. Turning to Slide 15. We reported a strong Q4 with revenue of $1.4 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $1.58, a 14% increase compared to last year; and income from continuing operations of $208 million, a 13% increase. 
Our Government Systems business posted its first full year growth in 6 years, and closed out the year with fourth quarter sales growth of 14% and its highest-ever quarterly operating margin. We continue to see growth in our IMS segment in both the aviation and non-aviation businesses. Commercial Systems' air transport aviation electronics portfolio delivered a solid quarter growth in OEM and aftermarket sales, while the business in regional aviation electronics portfolio continue to see weakness from the challenging business jet market conditions.
Our diluted average shares outstanding decreased from 133 million to 131 million due to our share repurchase program.
Now turning to Slide 16, I'd like to review briefly our full year 2016 results. We reported 2016 revenue of $5.3 billion, approximately flat year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $5.50, a 6% increase compared to last year; income from continuing operations of $727 million, a 5% increase; and operating cash flow from continuing operations of $723 million, which is down 3% year-over-year.
We are pretty pleased with these results in light of the challenging business market -- business jet market conditions. 
Now turning to slide 17, I'll walk you through the guidance for 2017. Importantly, this is just for Rockwell Collins' base business and does not include any impact from our acquisition of B/E Aerospace, which, again, we plan to close in the spring of 2017. We will update the guidance over the coming months as we get a better sense of the timing of the close. 
With that said, for 2017, we plan to generate total sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, representing growth of about 2%. This reflects Government System sales growing [ph] low to mid-single digits and accelerating growth rate from 2016. We expect Commercial Systems revenues to be about flat, as benefits from market share gains in air transport offset further declines in bizjet OE revenues. And we expect Information Management Services to be up mid to high single digits. 
Our total segment operating margins are expected to be about 21%. Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, resulting in free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Our R&D investment in 2017 is expected to be between $900 million and $950 million, and our full year income tax rate will be between 28% and 29%. 
Yesterday, B/E also reported results for the 3 and 9 months ended September 30. As reflected in the release, the company reported strong sales and earnings growth, and continues to build momentum going into 2017.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Kelly."

Now I want to walk through [ph] what I think could be the most exciting long-term benefit of the competition of the 2 companies, and that's our revenue synergies. As I said before, these all represent upside to our business case.
And we see 5 major areas of synergy. First area I'll talk about is the Business Aviation aftermarket. It'll be a prime area of focus for us. With more than 20,000 jets, we can offer a full complementary  of interiors from seating to lighting to electronics while aircraft are undergoing avionics modifications. And depending on the size of the aircraft, we could easily see between $200,000 to well over $1 million of opportunity per aircraft. Rockwell Collins' position on many military aircraft programs gives us an important access to customers, and this acquisition will allow us a broader offering to those customers. This is a channel that B/E currently just doesn't serve. 
Rockwell Collins has stronger OEM relationships, and that will aid further growth for standard interior sales. And likewise, B/E has stronger airline relationships that we think would generate opportunities for Rockwell Collins to sell more avionics; or likewise, opportunities where Rockwell Collins has strength to sell more interior equipment. If you think about that, these opportunities represent well over $50 million per opportunity. 
And finally, as you think about the transition to the next integrated digital airplane, perhaps the most exciting synergy is our combined portfolio will uniquely position us to integrate cabin products, smart network technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance aircraft uptime and airline profitability.
In summary, we are thrilled about this acquisition and the opportunities it provides to both companies' shareowners. Together, our company will be a leading supplier, with platforms for accelerated growth in new products and markets. The transaction is financially compelling and will allow us significant cost savings, and will deliver greater -- significantly greater value to our stakeholders than either company could on its own. Customers, employees, suppliers and shareowners will all benefit from this exciting combination. 
And I'll finish by adding my compliments to Amin and his team, who've done a tremendous job of building a leading franchise and creating value at B/E. We're eager to welcome the talented B/E Aerospace employees, and look forward to continuing to grow our business together. 
So let me turn the call back over to Ryan and we'll begin the Q&A."

And let me just explore that opportunity a little bit more to define what that is. Today, when aircraft come in for maintenance actions, that's when we typically will sell them avionics mods or even cabin entertainment, equipment mods and updates. And we do that through our pretty expansive dealer network. We've got over 300 dealers in the Business Aviation channel that help us do that. B/E currently doesn't have a dealer network. And in many cases, they don't have visibility to know those aircraft are coming in for mods and upgrades or maintenance actions, and so there's no point of sale for the interior products to let those customers know what the latest and greatest capabilities are. And as you can imagine, most of these customers are looking for some of the latest features and amenities that would go in the cabin, and we think it's going to be a great opportunity for us. When we know these folks are coming in for maintenance actions, their aircraft are going to be down for either a modification to the cabin systems or an avionics or even an engine overhaul, we can then upsell the cabin interiors to that. So as I look at that, I think that can have a meaningful increase, but almost double our opportunities as we do discretionary mods to -- with our current Avionics portfolio, because that's a [indiscernible]."

So let me give you a couple of figures of merit because I think they're important as you think about synergies. If you look at our content on the next-generation wide-body aircraft, if we combine B/E's content, it will triple our position, our content on programs like the 787, the A350, which we know are going to drive the preponderance of the future wide-body market. And it will nearly double our position in the narrow bodies. There are airline customers where B/E is extremely strong. We're not so strong, so there's opportunities for us with that expanded footprint to pull some Avionics opportunities. And likewise, there are airline customers where they are not as strong, but we do have strong Avionics positions that we could provide a broader offering to those customers. And I think if you think about that, as I talked in my prepared remarks, that's probably about a $50 million plus opportunity per major BFE selection or aircraft selection, probably more opportunity for the interiors than pulling the Avionics because of the relatively larger content that B/E has on an aircraft, but significant opportunities. And that's something that we've actually already seen with our ARINC acquisition, where there were airlines that they had a much stronger position with some of their services, and it just gave us access to better understand the needs and the demands and -- of those customers, and we've been able to pick up some share by doing that. So I think that's pretty exciting. And I will tell you, it doesn't require a lot of effort on our part. It's mostly channel management. We're talking about the existing product lines of both companies, so it's great upside for us, and we'll probably be able to prosecute those things pretty quickly."

We expect 90% of that $160 million to be achieved by our second full fiscal year, which is our fiscal 2019. And let me give you the 4 [ph] major financial drivers to those cost synergies, and it'll give you a perspective of the timing. The first is eliminating the duplicate public company costs and headquarters that Patrick outlined. That comes right away. That's pretty quick synergy, and that is pretty straightforward as you can imagine in a transaction like this. The second area is in supply chain savings, both direct supply chain, where we're buying materials that go in our and products as well as indirect, where we're buying either consumables or things that we use as well as services that we both buy externally. We think those savings are going to come pretty quickly as well. We've already got a detailed list of our supply chain overlap, where we expect to see synergies and we base our synergies on previous supply chain consolidation that we've done. So I think that's pretty straightforward. And again, that will happen pretty quickly. We've got a plan that will be able to hit the ground running on those supply chain synergies. The third area is consolidation of our IT systems and especially our manufacturing ERP system. And we'll start that right away, but that'll happen on really a plant by plant basis. So that will feather in over time. The first plants will obviously provide the synergies faster, and that'll come in over the first 3 to 4 years. And then the last area is leveraging our low-cost country manufacturing and engineering capability. The engineering side is mostly around design centers in India. We both have India design centers in Hyderabad, which will give us opportunity to have some consolidation, but also further leverage that IDC, India Design Center, for low-cost engineering. And then as you can imagine, companies -- global companies like ours are continually looking at where and how we build our products and how we do that in the most efficient manner. Those will take a little bit more time as we shift to some low-cost country manufacturing. So I'd say it's kind of upfront. You're going to see the elimination of the public cost, supply chain, start of the IT consolidation and then over time, the full IT consolidation and the low-cost country manufacturing and engineering will drive those synergies. Now we've got several others, but I would say these are the 4 meaningful areas of cost synergies."

It's something we spent a lot time analyzing as part of our decision here. First of all, let me to say this is a true cycle decision. We absolutely believe in the long-term nature of air traffic growth. B/E's business is much more driven to air traffic growth and airline profitability than what I'll say our core Rockwell Collins business is, which is more geared towards the cyclicality of OEM production. I really like that. I think this acquisition actually balances us and provides us opportunities to go into the retrofit market. As you know, when aircraft OEMs lower aircraft production rate, the airlines will then look to upgrade their existing aircraft and I believe we're coming into a major cycle where a lot of wide bodies are coming off lease and will be returned to the lessors. And with that, we're going to see great opportunities for retrofit of the cabins because these systems, when the aircraft come back to the lessors, they need to be reconfigured for the new airlines that they're going to. That's just an opportunity that we really don't see in our core business, so I really like the nature of the aftermarket revenues here. The other thing I'll say is we're both well-positioned on the wide-bodies that are going to drive the growth with the A350 and the 787. We have, in this plan, taken a hard look at the overall cycle of the legacy wide-bodies, factored that into our outlook. I'll also say that we did extraordinarily deep due diligence on the B/E backlog. It's very robust, and I think that we feel very comfortable that this acquisition is going to manage its way through what will be -- we will see some softness, no question in wide-body in near term, but there's also no question for the long run, to deliver the traffic growth, you have to have wide-body aircraft. And for the long run, this acquisition will create a lot of value for us."

But clearly, there's some things that as you look at our core business that factored into our thinking, one is that we now have all the cockpits on Boeing's next-generation aircraft, which is providing us with growth between now and when the 777x comes in. But at that point, we aren't going to have as many opportunities to gain share as we already have 100% of that particular market share. Now there'll be some new airplanes, but to continue at the growth rate, we feel we needed a broader portfolio of offerings. Another factor is the business aviation OEM environment. As we all know, and we've seen over the last several years, is it's questionable when that end market is going to recover. And I don't think, as I look at our core business, that we can be assured that that's going to be a growth engine for us going forward. Now we're not going to get out of that business. It's very important. We have -- get a lot of leverage across our other end markets. We use common product lines. It's a technology incubator for a lot of what we do. But again, as I look at how we're going to optimize the growth of the company, we felt we needed to have more opportunities to do that. So we did look at those 2 alternatives I outlined in my opening remarks. And I think one of the things about Rockwell Collins, while we've got a great technology base, if you talk to customers about what separates us in the marketplaces is the relationship, the -- they know we'll do what we say we're going to do. They trust us. They know we're going to support them and this customers and their long-term business opportunities. So we felt leveraging that capability was the best way to go and looking at how to broaden our portfolio. And as I mentioned, one of the important criteria is that making sure is we've brought in that portfolio, we broaden it with someone who, first of all, understand that portfolio, is well-positioned in the market, has enough scope and scale that that we're assured success and B/E is just a great fit, with all of their product lines being top the market, a well-established -- look, this is not -- they don't need a fix up from Rockwell Collins. This is a well-run business with well-respected positions. But they're also at a time where they're being challenged by the customers to provide more, what I'll say, smart implementation of their equipment. You kind of think of the future airplane that all of the galley equipment is going to be a node on the network, to either provide a better passenger experience, to allow the crew to interact differently to the passengers aboard for improved maintenance actions, and they're be impressed by their customers to bring us smart devices, smart cabin interior devices that integrate that capability. They don't have that, we do. We don't have the products, they do. So it's a really nice fit for us and I think we're good to be uniquely positioned to work with both the airlines and the OEMs to help shape that and provide a more efficient, effective interior market for them going forward. So I see a lot of good things about this opportunity here today."

Having said that, I do believe there's opportunities for us to grow this portfolio in the military market. So I'm pretty excited about those opportunities. You know, if you think about Rockwell Collins, we actually do a lot of work in the cabins of military aircraft. It's mostly mission systems that we put in, whether it refueling, signal intelligence, communications networks, those type of things. But all those aircraft when they're getting modified, all the interior systems are needed and are being modified. So I think that the business will present some significant opportunities for us to grow the military market. And as that business recovers, we'll see some increase shift back to a little bit more balance there. You know, I don't have a view that we need to stay 50-50 commercial and defense. I think that the mix and the balance is much more important at the product line, that you need to have the scope and scale there to compete effectively at the product line. And so, I feel quite comfortable with the overall mix shift here going forward. And as I said in my other remark, we are absolutely a believer that air traffic is going to continue to grow at that 4% to 6% historical growth rate. And so while I'm sure there will be OEM fluctuations through that in the long run, in order to deliver that traffic growth, there needs to be aircraft interiors and seats and all the things to do -- to deliver that. I feel very comfortable with this move. And I think it diversifies us as I said, with much more aftermarket opportunities. I really like the fact that the interiors get modified times in the life of an aircraft. Our Avionics typically don't. Other than mandate updates, they tend to stay on wing for the full life of the airplanes. So this really gives us a lot more retrofit opportunities, which when the OEM rates are be at [indiscernible] gives us other areas to offset that."

If you look at our business jet OEM revenues for fiscal '17, they're actually going to be down a little bit more than the OEM's production rate that you're probably basing your outlook on. There's a pretty significant amount of inventory in this system that's going to be fleshed out. So we are going to see significant declines year-on-year again in our OEM revenues. That's going to essentially offset the growth that we have in air transport. And then the other factor is that we've seen all year the parts recycling in the aftermarket, air transport aftermarket.

There's no question that what we do has more software control content in it than what B/E does today, but I see that as a great opportunity because that's going to shift over time. Everything's going to become a smart device. We're going to be embedded microprocessors and everything. We can be embedding software and software applications across the airplane.

I am very pleased to be speaking with you today about the transformative and complementary acquisition of B/E Aerospace. This transaction brings together 2 industry leading franchises with significant benefits to Rockwell Collins. It strengthens our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions, increasing our scale and establishing a new platform of growth for our company. 
The addition of B/E will also diversify and balance our portfolio across OEM, airline and aftermarket. And as we look to the future, it enhances our ability to integrate cabin equipment using smart technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance the experience of passengers and airline personnel. 
From a financial perspective, this combination is very attractive to both company shareowners. We project run rate pretax cost synergies of $160 million along with meaningful revenue synergies, which I'll discuss later in the call. Additionally, we expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year and combined 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion. The acquisition of B/E Aerospace is consistent with our vision to be the most trusted source of aviation and high-integrity solutions in the world.
Before I ask Amin to make a few comments, let me just say a few quick words about our earnings, which were also announced yesterday. We had a strong quarter of operational performance, highlighted by double-digit earnings per share growth and robust quarterly free cash flow generation. This gives us a great momentum headed into 2017. Over the long term, we're well-positioned to deliver accelerating top line revenue growth, double-digit earnings per share and strong cash flow growth. Patrick Allen is going to discuss our fourth quarter earnings results and our 2017 guidance later on in the call, but let me turn back to the transaction.
I'd like to thank B/E Aerospace's Founder and Chairman, Amin Khoury, for being here with me today. As you can imagine, to put together a deal like this, we've come to know each other and our respective companies quite well. We could not have found a better partner in B/E Aerospace, and I can't tell you -- I can tell you that on behalf of the nearly 20,000 employees at Rockwell Collins, we can't wait to bring them to the Rockwell Collins family.
Today's a big day for Amin. As Founder of B/E, he's achieved an extraordinary feat that we should all admire, from creating a small business with $3 million in revenues in 1987 to a global powerhouse of almost $3 billion today, and a leader in the markets -- all the markets that they serve. Very impressive. Congratulations, Amin, and I'd like to ask you to say a few words."

Thank you very much for your kind remarks. But obviously, it's no longer about me. It's about the wonderful benefit that this combination brings our customers and our employees and our shareholders.
Our combination with Rockwell Collins represents an excellent outcome for B/E Aerospace's stockholders, who will receive an immediate premium as well as a substantial equity interest in a strong combined company; broader range of products, customers; and the combined expertise and resources to create real and meaningful future value. We feel confident that this combination delivers significant long-term benefits neither company could realize on its own. We look forward to becoming part of Rockwell Collins and leveraging their technology to accelerate our long-term growth as we embark on the next chapter in the company's history. 
The opportunities available to us working together are boundless. We will truly be the premier supplier of front and back of aircraft products and will build on our deep customer relationships.

This transaction delivers great benefits to all of our constituencies. Our shareholders will realize significant and immediate value in the form of a 23% current premium to B/E's closing stock price on Friday and expected substantial equity upside in the combined company. Our customers will enjoy access to a greater breadth of products, technologies and the global scale and combined expertise continue serving their evolving needs. Our employees will have greater opportunities as part of a larger, more diversified company with enhanced opportunities for professional growth and advancement across Rockwell Collins' global platform. 
Importantly, having worked with Kelly and his team very closely throughout this process, I can assure you that Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace share the same cultural values, commitment to customers, focus on innovation, quality and sustained customer value. Rockwell Collins is acquiring a company that is in great shape. While I will not spend time on this call discussing earnings, we released our third quarter results yesterday. We recorded another outstanding quarter and we raised guidance for 2016. 
In sum, this is a tremendous opportunity for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins shareholders to participate in the long-term value-creation opportunity that neither company is able to achieve on its own. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Kelly."

I'll now talk through the transaction terms on Slide #4. Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. B/E Aerospace share",1151,"Well, thanks, Amin. I'll now talk through the transaction terms on Slide #4. Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. B/E Aerospace shareowners will receive consideration of $34.10 per share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock or each B/E Aerospace share they own, representing a value of $62 per share, subject to a 7.5% collar. B/E Aerospace shareowners will own approximately 20% of Rockwell Collins following the completion of the transaction.
B/E Aerospace will operate as a new aircraft interior systems segment within Rockwell Collins and will continue to be run by Werner Lieberherr and B/E's proven management team. The transaction is expected to close in the spring of 2017 on the completion of regulatory approvals and approval of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace shareowners as well as other customary closing conditions.
Now turning to Slide 5. I want to provide a bit more detail regarding the strategic and financial rationale for this transaction. This acquisition is the result of a multi-year strategic process we undertook to determine how best to grow our company. This included the formation of a new strategic and financial committee of our board. 
We looked at 2 major alternatives: One was to take our capabilities into new markets and the other was to expand our capabilities into our current market channels. And we selected this path and developed some criteria of technical differentiation, long-life cycle, and market leadership.
B/E Aerospace is a terrific match. The combination solidifies our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions. We'll be able to broaden our offerings to customers throughout -- through an expansion of our traditional core business, while also strengthening and balancing our portfolio mix.
B/E Aerospace is a leader in nearly all the markets they serve, and similar to Rockwell Collins, has a repetition for innovation, quality and on-time delivery. B/E Aerospace also has a highly visible, long-cycle backlog. Beyond new aircraft deliveries, their $12 billion of installed base provides a strong flow of aftermarket retrofit opportunities that balances our current cyclical exposure to OEM production rates.
Now I touched on the combination benefits, but let me just quickly reiterate: We expect to generate approximately $160 million in projected pretax run rate cost synergies. We expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year. I believe that are meaningful revenue synergies that create significant uptick -- upside to this business case, and we expect 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion.
B/E Aerospace business will fit within Rockwell Collins as a separate segment as we have successfully done with the ARINC acquisition. This will assure no disruption to our customer commitment.
Now in addition to the compelling financial aspects that I outlined, the deal is structured to preserve a solid investment-grade rating, retain our dividend payout of approximately 25% of net income, it takes advantage of attractive credit markets and generates significantly greater value than alternative uses of capital, including share repurchases.
Moving on to Slide 6. For those of you who may not be as familiar with the B/E business, I want to give you an overview of B/E Aerospace. B/E is a leading provider of highly engineered, aviation-certified interior aircraft products. The company is a leader in all of its major product categories and has a blue chip customer base of airlines, commercial and biz jet OEMs, aircraft completion centers and leasing companies. And as I've mentioned, B/E has a high-quality backlog with multi-year visibility and a large installed base of over $12 billion that drives aftermarket retrofit demand. The company has about 10,000 employees who directly contribute to B/E Aerospace's success in the market and will be a great fit at Rockwell Collins, as we work together to build on our respective reputation.
Now looking at the right-hand side of the chart, you can see B/E Aerospace's breakdown of 2015 revenues by customer, by market and by segment. About 80% of its revenue is from the airline customers, 60% is line fit and 77% is within the commercial aircraft segment.
Now Slide 7 and 8 break down B/E's business by its commercial aircraft segment and business jet segment. Let's start with the commercial aircraft on Slide 7. You can see B/E's 4 key products in this segment are seating, galley inserts, oxygen and passenger service units, and interior structures. B/E is a product line leader, with strong share in first, business and premium economy and main cabin seating, and has won 40% to 50% of the business class and main cabin awards and orders over the past 2 years. 
B/E is also a product line leader in food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, referred to as galley inserts, and they have won 85% of the galley insert awards and orders over the past 2 years. They are the supplier of passenger oxygen systems for all Airbus and Boeing platforms currently in production. And finally, B/E is the supplier of Spacewall modular lavatory systems for the Boeing 737 aircraft. 
Turning now to Slide 8, let's take a look at B/E's business jet segment. Key products within this segment are super first class suites, business jet seating and interior lighting systems. B/E is a product line leader in bespoke customer super first class cabins. There, they were recently awarded a $260 million program for high-end suites, which sets a new industry standard and they have won more than 75% of super first class awards over the past couple of years. 
The company is a product line leader in all major seating categories including business jet, VIP aircraft and civilian helicopters. It is the sole source for Boeing 737 and Boeing 737 MAX cabin, cabin lighting and does retrofit lighting on a number of aircraft as well. 
Turning now to Slide 9. You can see the impressive combination of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace offering in the cockpit, cabin and aircraft exterior. The transaction broadens our portfolio with leading products in attractive segments that strengthens and broadens our airline relationships. With the addition of these capabilities, Rockwell Collins will have an increased ability to provide integrated offerings throughout the aircraft.
Turning now to Slide 10. As you can see, the company will be more diversified and in different ways than we are today. The combined company will have greater presence in the commercial air transport market. This will strengthen our aftermarket mix with more retrofit opportunities. And you can see in the diagram, our customer mix will be nicely balanced between U.S. and international. This transaction creates more resilient and diversified business, with greater earnings power and reduced volatility. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick Allen, and he's going to discuss the combined company's financial highlights. Patrick?"
603843,403754781,1059263,"Rockwell Collins Inc., 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2016",2016-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Slide 11 shows the combined company's pro forma financials. As you can see, the combined company would have generated approximately $8.1 billion of revenue and $1.9 billion in EBITDA through the 12 months ende",944,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Slide 11 shows the combined company's pro forma financials. As you can see, the combined company would have generated approximately $8.1 billion of revenue and $1.9 billion in EBITDA through the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. 
Both companies announced earnings results yesterday, so these are current numbers and do not reflect synergies in the combined earnings power of the 2 companies, which together, we expect will create significantly even greater value in the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and talk about some of those synergies. The transaction is expected to generate run rate pretax cost synergies of approximately $160 million, which translates to $125 million after tax, due to some of the synergies coming from favorable tax jurisdictions. In addition, we expect to make certain conforming purchase accounting adjustments, which will benefit earnings by $60 million to $90 million per year for about 6 years. 
The sources of the cost synergies will come from elimination of duplicate public company costs and headquarters consolidation, low-cost country manufacturing, supply chain savings, consolidation of IT systems and rationalization of our sales and customer support organization. We have a long history of successfully integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies, as you saw with our ARINC acquisition, and we have established a very clear path to realizing these savings.
Additionally, significant revenue synergies exist, which Kelly will talk about in more detail, but are not included and represent upside to our business case. The cost to achieve these synergies is about $120 million, the bulk of which will be incurred over the next 3 years.
Slide 13 provide some additional color about our near-term capital deployment. As always, we will continue to invest in organic growth. We will continue investing in research and development, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales of the combined organization. We plan to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to deleverage, and we expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be under 3 within 2 years. We plan to structure our financing with a $1.5 billion, 3-year, prepayable term loan to facilitate this plan.
And we remain focused on shareholder return. We plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income. We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes, we expect to resume our normal share repurchase program. And we're committed to maintaining strong liquidity and flexibility, and preserving an investment-grade rating, which we currently expect to be a solid BBB.
Now let me quickly summarize our earning results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on the following slides. Turning to Slide 15. We reported a strong Q4 with revenue of $1.4 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $1.58, a 14% increase compared to last year; and income from continuing operations of $208 million, a 13% increase. 
Our Government Systems business posted its first full year growth in 6 years, and closed out the year with fourth quarter sales growth of 14% and its highest-ever quarterly operating margin. We continue to see growth in our IMS segment in both the aviation and non-aviation businesses. Commercial Systems' air transport aviation electronics portfolio delivered a solid quarter growth in OEM and aftermarket sales, while the business in regional aviation electronics portfolio continue to see weakness from the challenging business jet market conditions.
Our diluted average shares outstanding decreased from 133 million to 131 million due to our share repurchase program.
Now turning to Slide 16, I'd like to review briefly our full year 2016 results. We reported 2016 revenue of $5.3 billion, approximately flat year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $5.50, a 6% increase compared to last year; income from continuing operations of $727 million, a 5% increase; and operating cash flow from continuing operations of $723 million, which is down 3% year-over-year.
We are pretty pleased with these results in light of the challenging business market -- business jet market conditions. 
Now turning to slide 17, I'll walk you through the guidance for 2017. Importantly, this is just for Rockwell Collins' base business and does not include any impact from our acquisition of B/E Aerospace, which, again, we plan to close in the spring of 2017. We will update the guidance over the coming months as we get a better sense of the timing of the close. 
With that said, for 2017, we plan to generate total sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, representing growth of about 2%. This reflects Government System sales growing low to mid-single digits and accelerating growth rate from 2016. We expect Commercial Systems revenues to be about flat, as benefits from market share gains in air transport offset further declines in bizjet OE revenues. And we expect Information Management Services to be up mid to high single digits. 
Our total segment operating margins are expected to be about 21%. Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, resulting in free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Our R&D investment in 2017 is expected to be between $900 million and $950 million, and our full year income tax rate will be between 28% and 29%. 
Yesterday, B/E also reported results for the 3 and 9 months ended September 30. As reflected in the release, the company reported strong sales and earnings growth, and continues to build momentum going into 2017.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Kelly."

Now I want to walk through what I think could be the most exciting long-term benefit of the competition of the 2 companies, and that's our revenue synergies. As I said before, these all represent upside to our business case.
And we see 5 major areas of synergy. First area I'll talk about is the Business Aviation aftermarket. It'll be a prime area of focus for us. With more than 20,000 jets, we can offer a full complementary  of interiors from seating to lighting to electronics while aircraft are undergoing avionics modifications. And depending on the size of the aircraft, we could easily see between $200,000 to well over $1 million of opportunity per aircraft. Rockwell Collins' position on many military aircraft programs gives us an important access to customers, and this acquisition will allow us a broader offering to those customers. This is a channel that B/E currently just doesn't serve. 
Rockwell Collins has stronger OEM relationships, and that will aid further growth for standard interior sales. And likewise, B/E has stronger airline relationships that we think would generate opportunities for Rockwell Collins to sell more avionics; or likewise, opportunities where Rockwell Collins has strength to sell more interior equipment. If you think about that, these opportunities represent well over $50 million per opportunity. 
And finally, as you think about the transition to the next integrated digital airplane, perhaps the most exciting synergy is our combined portfolio will uniquely position us to integrate cabin products, smart network technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance aircraft uptime and airline profitability.
In summary, we are thrilled about this acquisition and the opportunities it provides to both companies' shareowners. Together, our company will be a leading supplier, with platforms for accelerated growth in new products and markets. The transaction is financially compelling and will allow us significant cost savings, and will deliver greater -- significantly greater value to our stakeholders than either company could on its own. Customers, employees, suppliers and shareowners will all benefit from this exciting combination. 
And I'll finish by adding my compliments to Amin and his team, who've done a tremendous job of building a leading franchise and creating value at B/E. We're eager to welcome the talented B/E Aerospace employees, and look forward to continuing to grow our business together. 
So let me turn the call back over to Ryan and we'll begin the Q&A."

And let me just explore that opportunity a little bit more to define what that is. Today, when aircraft come in for maintenance actions, that's when we typically will sell them avionics mods or even cabin entertainment, equipment mods and updates. And we do that through our pretty expansive dealer network. We've got over 300 dealers in the Business Aviation channel that help us do that. B/E currently doesn't have a dealer network. And in many cases, they don't have visibility to know those aircraft are coming in for mods and upgrades or maintenance actions, and so there's no point of sale for the interior products to let those customers know what the latest and greatest capabilities are. And as you can imagine, most of these customers are looking for some of the latest features and amenities that would go in the cabin, and we think it's going to be a great opportunity for us. When we know these folks are coming in for maintenance actions, their aircraft are going to be down for either a modification to the cabin systems or an avionics or even an engine overhaul, we can then upsell the cabin interiors to that. So as I look at that, I think that can have a meaningful increase, but almost double our opportunities as we do discretionary mods to -- with our current Avionics portfolio, because that's a [indiscernible]."

So let me give you a couple of figures of merit because I think they're important as you think about synergies. If you look at our content on the next-generation wide-body aircraft, if we combine B/E's content, it will triple our position, our content on programs like the 787, the A350, which we know are going to drive the preponderance of the future wide-body market. And it will nearly double our position in the narrow bodies. There are airline customers where B/E is extremely strong. We're not so strong, so there's opportunities for us with that expanded footprint to pull some Avionics opportunities. And likewise, there are airline customers where they are not as strong, but we do have strong Avionics positions that we could provide a broader offering to those customers. And I think if you think about that, as I talked in my prepared remarks, that's probably about a $50 million plus opportunity per major BFE selection or aircraft selection, probably more opportunity for the interiors than pulling the Avionics because of the relatively larger content that B/E has on an aircraft, but significant opportunities. And that's something that we've actually already seen with our ARINC acquisition, where there were airlines that they had a much stronger position with some of their services, and it just gave us access to better understand the needs and the demands and -- of those customers, and we've been able to pick up some share by doing that. So I think that's pretty exciting. And I will tell you, it doesn't require a lot of effort on our part. It's mostly channel management. We're talking about the existing product lines of both companies, so it's great upside for us, and we'll probably be able to prosecute those things pretty quickly."

We expect 90% of that $160 million to be achieved by our second full fiscal year, which is our fiscal 2019. And let me give you the 4, what I'll say, major financial drivers to those cost synergies, and it'll give you a perspective of the timing. The first is eliminating the duplicate public company costs and headquarters that Patrick outlined. That comes right away. That's pretty quick synergy. And that is pretty straightforward, as you can imagine, in a transaction like this. The second area is in supply chain savings, both direct supply chain, where we're buying materials that go in our end ducts; as well as indirect, where we're buying either consumables or things that we use, as well as services that we both buy externally. We think those savings are going to come pretty quickly as well. We've already got a detailed list of our supply chain overlap, where we expect to see synergies, and we based our synergies on previous supply chain consolidation that we've done. So I think that's pretty straightforward. And again, that will happen pretty quickly. We've got a plan that will be able to hit the ground running on those supply chain synergies. The third area is consolidation of our IT systems, and especially our manufacturing ERP system. And we'll start that right away, but that'll happen on a -- really a plant-by-plant basis. So that will feather in over time. The first plants will obviously provide the synergies faster, and that'll come in over the first 3 to 4 years. And then the last area is leveraging our low-cost country manufacturing and engineering capability. The engineering side is mostly around design centers in India. We both have India design centers in Hyderabad, which will give us opportunity to have some consolidation; but also further leverage that IDC, India Design Center, for low-cost engineering. And then as you can imagine, companies -- global companies like ours are continually looking at where and how we build our products and how we do that in the most efficient manner. Those will take a little bit more time as we shift to some low-cost country manufacturing. So I'd say, kind of upfront, you're going to see the elimination of the public cost, supply chain, start of the IT consolidation and then, over time, the full IT consolidation, and the low-cost country manufacturing and engineering will drive those synergies. Now we've got several others, but I would say they're -- these are the 4 meaningful areas of cost synergy."

We absolutely believe in the long-term nature of air traffic growth. B/E's business",341,"Good question, Myles. It's something we spent a lot time analyzing as a part of the -- our decision here. First of all, let me to say this is a through cycle acquisition. We absolutely believe in the long-term nature of air traffic growth. B/E's business is much more driven to air traffic growth and airline profitability than what, I'll say, our core Rockwell Collins business is, which is more geared towards the cyclicality of OEM production. I really like that. I think it -- this acquisition actually balances us and provides us opportunities to go into the retrofit market. As you know, when aircraft OEMs lower aircraft production rate, the airlines will then look to upgrade their existing aircraft, and I believe we're coming into a major cycle where a lot of wide-bodies are coming off lease and will be returned to the lessors. And with that, we're going to see great opportunities for retrofit of the cabins because these systems, when the aircraft come back to the lessors, they need to be reconfigured for the new airlines that they're going to. That's just an opportunity we really don't see in our core business, so I really like the nature of the aftermarket revenues here. The other thing I'll say is we're both well-positioned on the wide-bodies that are going to drive the growth, with the A350 and the 787. We have, in this plan, taken a hard look at the overall cycle of the legacy wide-bodies, factored that into our outlook. I'll also say that we did extraordinarily deep due diligence on the B/E backlog. It's very robust, and I think that we feel very comfortable that this acquisition is going to manage its way through what will be -- we will see some softness, no question, in wide-body in near term, but there's no -- also no question for the long run, to deliver the traffic growth, you have to have wide-body aircraft. And for the long run, this acquisition will create a lot of value for us."

Well, the only thing I'd say is that it was a look at how to optimize as opposed to a defensive -- any kind of a defensive maneuver. But clearly, there's some things that, as you look at our core business, that factored into our thinking. One is that",590,"Yes. Well, the only thing I'd say is that it was a look at how to optimize as opposed to a defensive -- any kind of a defensive maneuver. But clearly, there's some things that, as you look at our core business, that factored into our thinking. One is that we now have all the cockpits on Boeing's next-generation aircraft, which is providing us great growth between now and when the 777x comes in. But at that point, we aren't going to have as many opportunities to gain share as we already have 100% of that particular market share. Now there'll be some new airplanes, but to continue at the growth rate, we feel we needed a broader portfolio of offerings. Another factor is the business aviation OEM environment, as we all know. And we've seen, over the last several years, is it's questionable when that end market is going to recover. And I don't think, as I look at our core business, that we can be assured that that's going to be a growth engine for us going forward. Now we're not going to get out of that business. It's very important. We have -- get a lot of leverage across our other end markets. We use common product lines. It's a technology incubator for a lot of what we do. But again, as I look at how we're going to optimize the growth of the company, we felt we needed to have more opportunities to do that. So we did look at those 2 alternatives I outlined in my opening remarks. And I think one of the things about Rockwell Collins, while we've got a great technology base, if you talk to customers about what separates us in the marketplaces is the relationship, the -- they know we'll do what we say we're going to do. They trust us. They know we're going to support them and their customers and their long-term business opportunities. So we felt leveraging that capability was the best way to go, and looking at how to broaden our portfolio. And as I mentioned, one of the important criteria is that making sure as we broaden that portfolio, we broaden it with someone who, first of all, understands that portfolio, is well-positioned in the market, has enough scope and scale that we're assured success. And B/E is just a great fit, with all of their product lines being top in the market, a well-established -- look, this is not a -- they don't need a fix-up from Rockwell Collins. This is a well-run business with well-respected positions. But they're also at a time where they're being challenged by the customers to provide more, what I'll say, smart implementation of their equipment. You can kind of think of the future airplane that all of the galley equipment is going to be a node on the network, to either provide a better passenger experience, to allow the crew to interact differently with the passengers or for improved maintenance actions. And they're being pressed by their customers to bring smart devices, smart cabin interior devices that integrate that capability. They don't have that, we do. We don't have the products, they do. So it's a really nice fit for us. And I think we're going to be uniquely positioned to work with both the airlines and the OEMs to help shape that and provide a more efficient, effective interior market for them going forward. So I see a lot of good things about this opportunity here today."

Having said that, I do believe there's opportunities for us to grow this portfolio in the military market. So I'm pretty excited about those opportunities. You know, if you think about Rockwell Collins, we actually do a lot of work in the cabins of military aircraft. It's mostly mission systems equipment that we put in, either air refueling, signals intelligence, communications networks, those type of things. But all those aircraft when they're getting modified, all the interior systems are needed and are being modified. So I think that the business will present some significant opportunities for us to grow the military market. And as that business recovers, we'll see some increase shift back to a little bit more balance there. You know, I don't have a view that we need to stay 50-50 commercial and defense. I think that the mix and the balance is much more important at the product line, that you need to have the scope and scale there to compete effectively at the product line. And so, I feel quite comfortable with the overall mix shift here going forward. And as I said in my other remark, we are absolutely a believer that air traffic is going to continue to grow at that 4% to 6% historical growth rate. And so while I'm sure there will be OEM fluctuations through that, in the long run, in order to deliver that traffic growth, there needs to be aircraft interiors and seats and all the things to do -- to deliver that. So I feel very comfortable with this move. And I think it diversifies us, as I said, with much more aftermarket opportunities. I really like the fact that the interiors get modified multiple times in the life of an aircraft. Our Avionics typically don't. Other than mandate updates, they tend to stay on wing through the full life of the airplane. So this really gives us a lot more retrofit opportunities, which when the OEM rates are being debated gives us other areas to offset that."

I am very pleased to be speaking with you today about the transformative and complementary acquisition of B/E Aerospace. This transaction brings together 2 industry leading franchises with significant benefits to Rockwell Collins. It strengthens our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions, increasing our scale and establishing a new platform of growth for our company. 
The addition of B/E will also diversify and balance our portfolio across OEM, airline and aftermarket. And as we look to the future, it enhances our ability to integrate cabin equipment using smart technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance the experience of passengers and airline personnel. 
From a financial perspective, this combination is very attractive to both companies' shareowners. We project run rate pretax cost synergies of $160 million along with meaningful revenue synergies, which I'll discuss later in the call. Additionally, we expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year and combined 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion. The acquisition of B/E Aerospace is consistent with our vision to be the most trusted source of aviation and high-integrity solutions in the world.
Before I ask Amin to make a few comments, let me just say a few quick words about our earnings, which were also announced yesterday. We had a strong quarter of operational performance, highlighted by double-digit earnings per share growth and robust quarterly free cash flow generation. This gives us a great momentum headed into 2017. Over the long term, we're well-positioned to deliver accelerating top line revenue growth, double-digit earnings per share and strong cash flow growth. Patrick Allen is going to discuss our fourth quarter earnings results and our 2017 guidance later on in the call, but let me turn back to the transaction.
I'd like to thank B/E Aerospace's Founder and Chairman, Amin Khoury, for being here with me today. As you can imagine, to put together a deal like this, we've come to know each other and our respective companies quite well. We could not have found a better partner in B/E Aerospace, and I can't tell you -- I can tell you that on behalf of the nearly 20,000 employees at Rockwell Collins, we can't wait to bring them to the Rockwell Collins family.
Today's a big day for Amin. As Founder of B/E, he's achieved an extraordinary feat that we should all admire, from creating a small business with $3 million in revenues in 1987 to a global powerhouse of almost $3 billion today, and a leader in the markets -- all the markets that they serve. Very impressive. Congratulations, Amin, and I'd like to ask you to say a few words."

Thank you very much for your kind remarks. But obviously, it's no longer about me. It's about the wonderful benefit that this combination brings our customers and our employees and our shareholders.
Our combination with Rockwell Collins represents an excellent outcome for B/E Aerospace's stockholders, who will receive an immediate premium as well as a substantial equity interest in a strong combined company; broader range of products, customers, and the combined expertise and resources to create real and meaningful future value. We feel confident that this combination delivers significant long-term benefits neither company could realize on its own. We look forward to becoming part of Rockwell Collins and leveraging their technology to accelerate our long-term growth as we embark on the next chapter in the company's history. 
The opportunities available to us working together are boundless. We will truly be the premier supplier of front and back of aircraft products and will build on our deep customer relationships. For me personally, I can retire knowing that B/E Aerospace is in Kelly Ortberg's extremely capable hands, with Werner Lieberherr continuing to get the business while leveraging the full resources of Rockwell Collins. 
This transaction delivers great benefits to all of our constituencies. Our shareholders will realize significant and immediate value in the form of a 23% current premium to B/E's closing stock price on Friday and expected substantial equity upside in the combined company. Our customers will enjoy access to a greater breadth of products, technologies and the global scale and combined expertise continue serving their evolving needs. Our employees will have greater opportunities as part of a larger, more diversified company with enhanced opportunities for professional growth and advancement across Rockwell Collins' global platform. 
Importantly, having worked with Kelly and his team very closely throughout this process, I can assure you that Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace share the same cultural values, commitment to customers, focus on innovation, quality and sustained customer value. Rockwell Collins is acquiring a company that is in great shape. While I will not spend time on this call discussing earnings, we released our third quarter results yesterday. We recorded another outstanding quarter and we raised guidance for 2016. 
In sum, this is a tremendous opportunity for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins shareholders to participate in the long-term value-creation opportunity that neither company is able to achieve on its own. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Kelly."

Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. B/E Aerospace share",1151,"Well, thanks, Amin. I'll now talk through the transaction terms on Slide #4. Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. B/E Aerospace shareowners will receive consideration of $34.10 per share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock or each B/E Aerospace share they own, representing a value of $62 per share, subject to a 7.5% collar. B/E Aerospace shareowners will own approximately 20% of Rockwell Collins following the completion of the transaction.
B/E Aerospace will operate as a new aircraft interior systems segment within Rockwell Collins and will continue to be run by Werner Lieberherr and B/E's proven management team. The transaction is expected to close in the spring of 2017 on the completion of regulatory approvals and approval of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace shareowners as well as other customary closing conditions.
Now turning to Slide 5. I want to provide a bit more detail regarding the strategic and financial rationale for this transaction. This acquisition is the result of a multi-year strategic process we undertook to determine how best to grow our company. This included the formation of a new strategic and financial committee of our board. 
We looked at 2 major alternatives: One was to take our capabilities into new markets and the other was to expand our capabilities into our current market channels. And we selected this path and developed some criteria of technical differentiation, long-life cycle, and market leadership.
B/E Aerospace is a terrific match. The combination solidifies our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions. We'll be able to broaden our offerings to customers throughout -- through an expansion of our traditional core business, while also strengthening and balancing our portfolio mix.
B/E Aerospace is a leader in nearly all the markets they serve, and similar to Rockwell Collins, has a repetition for innovation, quality and on-time delivery. B/E Aerospace also has a highly visible, long-cycle backlog. Beyond new aircraft deliveries, their $12 billion of installed base provides a strong flow of aftermarket retrofit opportunities that balances our current cyclical exposure to OEM production rates.
Now I touched on the combination benefits, but let me just quickly reiterate: We expect to generate approximately $160 million in projected pretax run rate cost synergies. We expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year. I believe there are meaningful revenue synergies that create significant uptick -- upside to this business case, and we expect 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion.
B/E Aerospace business will fit within Rockwell Collins as a separate segment as we have successfully done with the ARINC acquisition. This will assure no disruption to our customer commitment.
Now in addition to the compelling financial aspects that I outlined, the deal is structured to preserve a solid investment-grade rating, retain our dividend payout of approximately 25% of net income, it takes advantage of attractive credit markets and generates significantly greater value than alternative uses of capital, including share repurchases.
Moving on to Slide 6. For those of you who may not be as familiar with the B/E business, I want to give you an overview of B/E Aerospace. B/E is a leading provider of highly engineered, aviation-certified interior aircraft products. The company is a leader in all of its major product categories and has a blue chip customer base of airlines, commercial and biz jet OEMs, aircraft completion centers and leasing companies. And as I've mentioned, B/E has a high-quality backlog with multi-year visibility and a large installed base of over $12 billion that drives aftermarket retrofit demand. The company has about 10,000 employees who directly contribute to B/E Aerospace's success in the market and will be a great fit at Rockwell Collins, as we work together to build on our respective reputation.
Now looking at the right-hand side of the chart, you can see B/E Aerospace's breakdown of 2015 revenues by customer, by market and by segment. About 80% of its revenue is from the airline customers, 60% is line fit and 77% is within the commercial aircraft segment.
Now Slide 7 and 8 break down B/E's business by its commercial aircraft segment and business jet segment. Let's start with the commercial aircraft on Slide 7. You can see B/E's 4 key products within this segment are seating, galley inserts, oxygen and passenger service units, and interior structures. B/E is a product line leader, with strong share in first, business and premium economy and main cabin seating, and has won 40% to 50% of the business class and main cabin awards and orders over the past 2 years. 
B/E is also a product line leader in food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, referred to as galley inserts, and they have won 85% of the galley insert awards and orders over the past 2 years. They are the supplier of passenger oxygen systems for all Airbus and Boeing platforms currently in production. And finally, B/E is the supplier of Spacewall modular lavatory systems for the Boeing 737 aircraft. 
Turning now to Slide 8, let's take a look at B/E's business jet segment. Key products within this segment are super first class suites, business jet seating and interior lighting systems. B/E is a product line leader in bespoke customer super first class cabins. There, they were recently awarded a $260 million program for high-end suites, which sets a new industry standard and they have won more than 75% of super first class awards over the past couple of years. 
The company is a product line leader in all major seating categories including business jet, VIP aircraft and civilian helicopters. It is the sole source for Boeing 737 and Boeing 737 MAX cabin-- cabin lighting and does retrofit lighting on a number of aircraft as well. 
Turning now to Slide 9. You can see the impressive combination of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace offering in the cockpit, cabin and aircraft exterior. The transaction broadens our portfolio with leading products in attractive segments that strengthens and broadens our airline relationships. With the addition of these capabilities, Rockwell Collins will have an increased ability to provide integrated offerings throughout the aircraft.
Turning now to Slide 10. As you can see, the company will be more diversified and in different ways than we are today. The combined company will have greater presence in the commercial air transport market. This will strengthen our aftermarket mix with more retrofit opportunities. And you can see in the diagram, our customer mix will be nicely balanced between U.S. and international. This transaction creates more resilient and diversified business, with greater earnings power and reduced volatility. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick Allen, and he's going to discuss the combined company's financial highlights. Patrick?"

Slide 11 shows the combined company's pro forma financials. As you can see, the combined company would have generated approximately $8.1 billion of revenue and $1.9 billion in EBITDA through the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. 
Both companies announced earnings results yesterday, so these are current numbers and do not reflect synergies and the combined earnings power of the 2 companies, which together we expect will create significantly even greater value in the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and talk about some of those synergies. The transaction is expected to generate run rate pretax cost synergies of approximately $160 million, which translates to $125 million after tax, due to some of the synergies coming from favorable tax jurisdictions. In addition, we expect to make certain conforming purchase accounting adjustments, which will benefit earnings by $60 million to $90 million per year for about 6 years. 
The sources of the cost synergies will come from elimination of duplicate public company costs and headquarters' consolidation, low-cost country manufacturing, supply chain savings, consolidation of IT systems and rationalization of our sales and customer support organization. We have a long history of successfully integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies, as you saw with our ARINC acquisition, and we have established a very clear path to realizing these savings.
Additionally, significant revenue synergies exist, which Kelly will talk about in more detail, but are not included and represent upside to our business case. The cost to achieve these synergies is about $120 million, the bulk of which will be incurred over the next 3 years.
Slide 13 provides some additional color about our near-term capital deployment. As always, we will continue to invest in organic growth. We will continue investing in research and development, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales of the combined organization. We plan to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to deleverage, and we expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be under 3 within 2 years. We plan to structure our financing with a $1.5 billion, 3-year, prepayable term loan to facilitate this plan.
And we remain focused on shareholder return and plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income. We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple of years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes, we expect to resume our normal share repurchase program. And we're committed to maintaining strong liquidity and flexibility, and preserving an investment-grade rating, which we currently expect to be a solid BBB.
Now let me quickly summarize our earning results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on the following slides. Turning to Slide 15. We reported a strong Q4 with revenue of $1.4 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $1.58, a 14% increase compared to last year; and income from continuing operations of $208 million, a 13% increase. 
Our Government Systems business posted its first full year growth in 6 years, and closed out the year with fourth quarter sales growth of 14% and its highest-ever quarterly operating margin. We continue to see growth in our IMS segment in both the aviation and non-aviation businesses. Commercial Systems' air transport aviation electronics portfolio delivered a solid quarter of growth in OEM and aftermarket sales, while the business in regional aviation electronics portfolio continue to see weakness from the challenging business jet market conditions.
Our diluted average shares outstanding decreased from 133 million to 131 million due to our share repurchase program.
Now turning to Slide 16, I'd like to review briefly our full year 2016 results. We reported 2016 revenue of $5.3 billion, approximately flat year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $5.50, a 6% increase compared to last year; income from continuing operations of $727 million, a 5% increase; and operating cash flow from continuing operations of $723 million, which is down 3% year-over-year.
We are pretty pleased with these results in light of the challenging business market -- business jet market conditions. 
Now turning to Slide 17, I'll walk you through the guidance for 2017. Importantly, this is just for Rockwell Collins' base business and does not include any impact from our acquisition of B/E Aerospace, which, again, we plan to close in the spring of 2017. We will update the guidance over the coming months as we get a better sense of the timing of the close. 
With that said, for 2017, we plan to generate total sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, representing growth of about 2%. This reflects Government System sales growing low to mid-single digits and accelerating growth rate from 2016. We expect Commercial Systems revenues to be about flat, as benefits from market share gains in air transport offset further declines in bizjet OE revenues. And we expect Information Management Services to be up mid- to high- single digits. 
Our total segment operating margins are expected to be about 21%. Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, resulting in free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Our R&D investment in 2017 is expected to be between $900 million and $950 million, and our full year income tax rate will be between 28% and 29%. 
Yesterday, B/E also reported results for the 3 and 9 months ended September 30. As reflected in the release, the company reported strong sales and earnings growth, and continues to build momentum going into 2017.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Kelly."

Now I want to walk through what I think could be the most exciting long-term benefits of the combination of the 2 companies, and that's our revenue synergies. As I said before, these all represent upside to our business case.
And we see 5 major areas of synergy. First area I'll talk about is the Business Aviation aftermarket. It'll be a prime area of focus for us. With more than 20,000 jets, we can offer a full complementary  of interiors from seating to lighting to electronics while aircraft are undergoing avionics modifications. And depending on the size of the aircraft, we could easily see between $200,000 to well over $1 million of opportunity per aircraft. Rockwell Collins' position on many military aircraft programs gives us an important access to customers, and this acquisition will allow us a broader offering to those customers. This is a channel that B/E currently just doesn't serve. 
Rockwell Collins has stronger OEM relationships, and that will aid further growth for standard interior sales. And likewise, B/E has stronger airline relationships that we think would generate opportunities for Rockwell Collins to sell more avionics; or likewise, opportunities where Rockwell Collins has strength to sell more interior equipment. If you think about that, these opportunities represent well over $50 million per opportunity. 
And finally, as you think about the transition to the next integrated digital airplane, perhaps the most exciting synergy is our combined portfolio will uniquely position us to integrate cabin products, smart network technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance aircraft uptime and airline profitability.
In summary, we are thrilled about this acquisition and the opportunities it provides to both companies' shareowners. Together, our company will be a leading supplier, with platforms for accelerated growth in new products and markets. The transaction is financially compelling and will allow us significant cost savings, and will deliver greater -- significantly greater value to our stakeholders than either company could on its own. Customers, employees, suppliers and shareowners will all benefit from this exciting combination. 
And I'll finish by adding my compliments to Amin and his team, who've done a tremendous job of building a leading franchise and creating value at B/E. We're eager to welcome the talented B/E Aerospace employees, and look forward to continuing to grow our business together. 
So let me turn the call back over to Ryan and we'll begin the Q&A."

And let me just explore that opportunity a little bit more to define what that is. Today, when aircraft come in for maintenance actions, that's when we typically will sell them avionics mods or even cabin entertainment, equipment mods and updates. And we do that through our pretty expansive dealer network. We've got over 300 dealers in the Business Aviation channel that help us do that. B/E currently doesn't have a dealer network. And in many cases, they don't have visibility to know those aircraft are coming in for mods and upgrades or maintenance actions, and so there's no point of sale for the interior products to let those customers know what the latest and greatest capabilities are. And as you can imagine, most of these customers are looking for some of the latest features and amenities that would go in the cabin, and we think it's going to be a great opportunity for us. When we know these folks are coming in for maintenance actions, their aircraft are going to be down for either a modification to the cabin systems or an avionics or even an engine overhaul, we can then upsell the cabin interiors to that. So as I look at that, I think that can have a meaningful increase, but almost double our opportunities as we do discretionary mods to -- with our current Avionics portfolio, because that's a [indiscernible]."

So let me give you a couple of figures of merit because I think they're important as you think about synergies. If you look at our content on the next-generation wide-body aircraft, if we combine B/E's content, it will triple our position, our content on programs like the 787, the A350, which we know are going to drive the preponderance of the future wide-body market. And it will nearly double our position in the narrow bodies. There are airline customers where B/E is extremely strong. We're not so strong, so there's opportunities for us with that expanded footprint to pull some Avionics opportunities. And likewise, there are airline customers where they are not as strong, but we do have strong Avionics positions that we could provide a broader offering to those customers. And I think if you think about that, as I talked in my prepared remarks, that's probably about a $50 million plus opportunity per major BFE selection or aircraft selection, probably more opportunity for the interiors than pulling the Avionics because of the relatively larger content that B/E has on an aircraft, but significant opportunities. And that's something that we've actually already seen with our ARINC acquisition, where there were airlines that they had a much stronger position with some of their services, and it just gave us access to better understand the needs and the demands and -- of those customers, and we've been able to pick up some share by doing that. So I think that's pretty exciting. And I will tell you, it doesn't require a lot of effort on our part. It's mostly channel management. We're talking about the existing product lines of both companies, so it's great upside for us, and we'll probably be able to prosecute those things pretty quickly."

We expect 90% of that $160 million to be achieved by our second full fiscal year, which is our fiscal 2019. And let me give you the 4, what I'll say, major financial drivers to those cost synergies, and it'll give you a perspective of the timing. The first is eliminating the duplicate public company costs and headquarters that Patrick outlined. That comes right away. That's pretty quick synergy. And that is pretty straightforward, as you can imagine, in a transaction like this. The second area is in supply chain savings, both direct supply chain, where we're buying materials that go in our end products; as well as indirect, where we're buying either consumables or things that we use, as well as services that we both buy externally. We think those savings are going to come pretty quickly as well. We've already got a detailed list of our supply chain overlap, where we expect to see synergies, and we based our synergies on previous supply chain consolidation that we've done. So I think that's pretty straightforward. And again, that will happen pretty quickly. We've got a plan that we'll be able to hit the ground running on those supply chain synergies. The third area is consolidation of our IT systems, and especially our manufacturing ERP system. And we'll start that right away, but that'll happen on a -- really a plant-by-plant basis. So that will feather in over time. The first plants will obviously provide the synergies faster, and that'll come in over the first 3 to 4 years. And then the last area is leveraging our low-cost country manufacturing and engineering capability. The engineering side is mostly around design centers in India. We both have India design centers in Hyderabad, which will give us opportunity to have some consolidation; but also further leverage that IDC, India Design Center, for low-cost engineering. And then as you can imagine, companies -- global companies like ours are continually looking at where and how we build our products and how we do that in the most efficient manner. Those will take a little bit more time as we shift to some low-cost country manufacturing. So I'd say, kind of upfront, you're going to see the elimination of the public cost, supply chain, start of the IT consolidation and then, over time, the full IT consolidation, and the low-cost country manufacturing and engineering will drive those synergies. Now we've got several others, but I would say they're -- these are the 4 meaningful areas of cost synergy."

First of all, let me just say this is a through cycle acquisition. We absolutely believe in the long-term nature of air traffic growth. B/E's business is much more driven to air traffic growth and airline profitability than what, I'll say, our core Rockwell Collins business is, which is more geared towards the cyclicality of OEM production. I really like that. I think it -- this acquisition actually balances us and provides us opportunities to go into the retrofit market. As you know, when aircraft OEMs lower aircraft production rate, the airlines will then look to upgrade their existing aircraft, and I believe we're coming into a major cycle where a lot of wide-bodies are coming off lease and will be returned to the lessors. And with that, we're going to see great opportunities for retrofit of the cabins because these systems, when the aircraft come back to the lessors, they need to be reconfigured for the new airlines that they're going to. That's just an opportunity we really don't see in our core business, so I really like the nature of the aftermarket revenues here. The other thing I'll say is we're both well-positioned on the wide-bodies that are going to drive the growth, with the A350 and the 787. We have, in this plan, taken a hard look at the overall cycle of the legacy wide-bodies, factored that into our outlook. I'll also say that we did extraordinarily deep due diligence on the B/E backlog. It's very robust, and I think that we feel very comfortable that this acquisition is going to manage its way through what will be -- we will see some softness, no question, in wide-body in near term, but there's no -- also no question for the long run, to deliver the traffic growth, you have to have wide-body aircraft. And for the long run, this acquisition will create a lot of value for us."

Well, the only thing I'd say is that it was a look at how to optimize as opposed to a defensive -- any kind of a defensive maneuver. But clearly, there's some things that, as you look at our core business that factored into our thinking. One is that we now have all the cockpits on Boeing's next-generation aircraft, which is providing us great growth between now and when the 777x comes in. But at that point, we aren't going to have as many opportunities to gain share as we already have 100% of that particular market share. Now there'll be some new airplanes, but to continue at the growth rate, we feel we needed a broader portfolio of offerings. Another factor is the business aviation OEM environment, as we all know. And we've seen, over the last several years, is it's questionable when that end market is going to recover. And I don't think, as I look at our core business, that we can be assured that that's going to be a growth engine for us going forward. Now we're not going to get out of that business. It's very important. We have -- get a lot of leverage across our other end markets. We use common product lines. It's a technology incubator for a lot of what we do. But again, as I look at how we're going to optimize the growth of the company, we felt we needed to have more opportunities to do that. So we did look at those 2 alternatives I outlined in my opening remarks. And I think one of the things about Rockwell Collins, while we've got a great technology base, if you talk to customers about what separates us in the marketplaces is the relationship, the -- they know we'll do what we say we're going to do. They trust us. They know we're going to support them and their customers and their long-term business opportunities. So we felt leveraging that capability was the best way to go, and looking at how to broaden our portfolio. And as I mentioned, one of the important criteria is as making sure as we broaden that portfolio, we broaden it with someone who, first of all, understands that portfolio, is well-positioned in the market, has enough scope and scale that we're assured success. And B/E is just a great fit, with all of their product lines being top in the market, a well-established -- look, this is not a -- they don't need a fix-up from Rockwell Collins. This is a well-run business with well-respected positions. But they're also at a time where they're being challenged by the customers to provide more, what I'll say, smart implementation of their equipment. You can kind of think of the future airplane that all of the galley equipment is going to be a node on the network, to either provide a better passenger experience, to allow the crew to interact differently with the passengers or for improved maintenance actions. And they're being pressed by their customers to bring us smart devices, smart cabin interior devices that integrate that capability. They don't have that, we do. We don't have the products, they do. So it's a really nice fit for us. And I think we're going to be uniquely positioned to work with both the airlines and the OEMs to help shape that and provide a more efficient, effective interior market for them going forward. So I see a lot of good things about this opportunity here today."

Having said that, I do believe there's opportunities for us to grow this portfolio in the military market. So I'm pretty excited about those opportunities. You know, if you think about Rockwell Collins, we actually do a lot of work in the cabins of military aircraft. It's mostly mission systems equipment that we put in, either air refueling, signals intelligence, communications networks, those type of things. But all those aircraft when they're getting modified, all the interior systems are needed and are being modified. So I think that the business will present some significant opportunities for us to grow the military market. And as that business recovers, we'll see some increase shift back to a little bit more balance there. You know, I don't have a view that we need to stay 50-50 commercial and defense. I think that the mix and the balance is much more important at the product line, that you need to have the scope and scale there to compete effectively at the product line. And so, I feel quite comfortable with the overall mix shift here going forward. And as I said in my other remark, we are absolutely a believer that air traffic is going to continue to grow at that 4% to 6% historical growth rate. And so while I'm sure there will be OEM fluctuations through that, in the long run, in order to deliver that traffic growth, there needs to be aircraft interiors and seats and all the things to do -- to deliver that. So I feel very comfortable with this move. And I think it diversifies us, as I said, with much more aftermarket opportunities. I really like the fact that the interiors get modified multiple times in the life of an aircraft. Our Avionics typically don't. Other than mandate updates, they tend to stay on wing through the full life of the airplane. So this really gives us a lot more retrofit opportunities, which when the OEM rates are being debated gives us other areas to offset that."

There's no question that what we do has more software control content in it than what B/E does today, but I see that as a great opportunity because that's going to shift over time. Everything's going to become a smart device. We're going to be embedding microprocessors in everything. We're going to be embedding software and software applications across the airplane. I think this is a great opportunity for us to bring these portfolios together and seize that transformation that's going to happen in the market. So I think if you look 5, 6 years ahead, you'll see that this is a much different-looking product line with sensors, embedded sensors, controls, WiFi interfaces, secure networks throughout the airplane.

I am very pleased to be speaking with you today about the transformative and complementary acquisition of B/E Aerospace. This transaction brings together 2 industry leading franchises with significant benefits to Rockwell Collins. It strengthens our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions, increasing our scale and establishing a new platform of growth for our company. 
The addition of B/E will also diversify and balance our portfolio across OEM, airline and aftermarket. And as we look to the future, it enhances our ability to integrate cabin equipment using smart technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance the experience of passengers and airline personnel. 
From a financial perspective, this combination is very attractive to both companies' shareowners. We project run rate pretax cost synergies of $160 million along with meaningful revenue synergies, which I'll discuss later in the call. Additionally, we expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year and combined 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion. The acquisition of B/E Aerospace is consistent with our vision to be the most trusted source of aviation and high-integrity solutions in the world.
Before I ask Amin to make a few comments, let me just say a few quick words about our earnings, which were also announced yesterday. We had a strong quarter of operational performance, highlighted by double-digit earnings per share growth and robust quarterly free cash flow generation. This gives us a great momentum headed into 2017. Over the long term, we're well-positioned to deliver accelerating top line revenue growth, double-digit earnings per share and strong cash flow growth. Patrick Allen is going to discuss our fourth quarter earnings results and our 2017 guidance later on in the call, but let me turn back to the transaction.
I'd like to thank B/E Aerospace's Founder and Chairman, Amin Khoury, for being here with me today. As you can imagine, to put together a deal like this, we've come to know each other and our respective companies quite well. We could not have found a better partner in B/E Aerospace, and I can't tell you -- I can tell you that on behalf of the nearly 20,000 employees at Rockwell Collins, we can't wait to bring them to the Rockwell Collins family.
Today's a big day for Amin. As Founder of B/E, he's achieved an extraordinary feat that we should all admire, from creating a small business with $3 million in revenues in 1987 to a global powerhouse of almost $3 billion today, and a leader in the markets -- all the markets that they serve. Very impressive. Congratulations, Amin, and I'd like to ask you to say a few words."

Thank you very much for your kind remarks. But obviously, it's no longer about me. It's about the wonderful benefit that this combination brings our customers and our employees and our shareholders.
Our combination with Rockwell Collins represents an excellent outcome for B/E Aerospace's stockholders, who will receive an immediate premium as well as a substantial equity interest in a strong combined company; broader range of products, customers, and the combined expertise and resources to create real and meaningful future value. We feel confident that this combination delivers significant long-term benefits neither company could realize on its own. We look forward to becoming part of Rockwell Collins and leveraging their technology to accelerate our long-term growth as we embark on the next chapter in the company's history. 
The opportunities available to us working together are boundless. We will truly be the premier supplier of front and back of aircraft products and will build on our deep customer relationships. For me personally, I can retire knowing that B/E Aerospace is in Kelly Ortberg's extremely capable hands, with Werner Lieberherr continuing to get the business while leveraging the full resources of Rockwell Collins. 
This transaction delivers great benefits to all of our constituencies. Our shareholders will realize significant and immediate value in the form of a 23% current premium to B/E's closing stock price on Friday and expected substantial equity upside in the combined company. Our customers will enjoy access to a greater breadth of products, technologies and the global scale and combined expertise continue serving their evolving needs. Our employees will have greater opportunities as part of a larger, more diversified company with enhanced opportunities for professional growth and advancement across Rockwell Collins' global platform. 
Importantly, having worked with Kelly and his team very closely throughout this process, I can assure you that Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace share the same cultural values, commitment to customers, focus on innovation, quality and sustained customer value. Rockwell Collins is acquiring a company that is in great shape. While I will not spend time on this call discussing earnings, we released our third quarter results yesterday. We recorded another outstanding quarter and we raised guidance for 2016. 
In sum, this is a tremendous opportunity for B/E Aerospace and Rockwell Collins shareholders to participate in the long-term value-creation opportunity that neither company is able to achieve on its own. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Kelly."

I'll now talk through the transaction terms on Slide #4. Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. B/E Aerospace share",1151,"Well, thanks, Amin. I'll now talk through the transaction terms on Slide #4. Yesterday, we announced that Rockwell Collins plans to purchase B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. B/E Aerospace shareowners will receive consideration of $34.10 per share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock or each B/E Aerospace share they own, representing a value of $62 per share, subject to a 7.5% collar. B/E Aerospace shareowners will own approximately 20% of Rockwell Collins following the completion of the transaction.
B/E Aerospace will operate as a new aircraft interior systems segment within Rockwell Collins and will continue to be run by Werner Lieberherr and B/E's proven management team. The transaction is expected to close in the spring of 2017 on the completion of regulatory approvals and approval of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace shareowners as well as other customary closing conditions.
Now turning to Slide 5. I want to provide a bit more detail regarding the strategic and financial rationale for this transaction. This acquisition is the result of a multi-year strategic process we undertook to determine how best to grow our company. This included the formation of a new strategic and financial committee of our board. 
We looked at 2 major alternatives: One was to take our capabilities into new markets and the other was to expand our capabilities into our current market channels. And we selected this path and developed some criteria of technical differentiation, long-life cycle, and market leadership.
B/E Aerospace is a terrific match. The combination solidifies our position as a leading supplier of cockpit and cabin solutions. We'll be able to broaden our offerings to customers throughout -- through an expansion of our traditional core business, while also strengthening and balancing our portfolio mix.
B/E Aerospace is a leader in nearly all the markets they serve, and similar to Rockwell Collins, has a repetition for innovation, quality and on-time delivery. B/E Aerospace also has a highly visible, long-cycle backlog. Beyond new aircraft deliveries, their $12 billion of installed base provides a strong flow of aftermarket retrofit opportunities that balances our current cyclical exposure to OEM production rates.
Now I touched on the combination benefits, but let me just quickly reiterate: We expect to generate approximately $160 million in projected pretax run rate cost synergies. We expect double-digit accretion to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year. I believe there are meaningful revenue synergies that create significant uptick -- upside to this business case, and we expect 5-year free cash flow generation in excess of $6 billion.
B/E Aerospace business will fit within Rockwell Collins as a separate segment as we have successfully done with the ARINC acquisition. This will assure no disruption to our customer commitment.
Now in addition to the compelling financial aspects that I outlined, the deal is structured to preserve a solid investment-grade rating, retain our dividend payout of approximately 25% of net income, it takes advantage of attractive credit markets and generates significantly greater value than alternative uses of capital, including share repurchases.
Moving on to Slide 6. For those of you who may not be as familiar with the B/E business, I want to give you an overview of B/E Aerospace. B/E is a leading provider of highly engineered, aviation-certified interior aircraft products. The company is a leader in all of its major product categories and has a blue chip customer base of airlines, commercial and biz jet OEMs, aircraft completion centers and leasing companies. And as I've mentioned, B/E has a high-quality backlog with multi-year visibility and a large installed base of over $12 billion that drives aftermarket retrofit demand. The company has about 10,000 employees who directly contribute to B/E Aerospace's success in the market and will be a great fit at Rockwell Collins, as we work together to build on our respective reputation.
Now looking at the right-hand side of the chart, you can see B/E Aerospace's breakdown of 2015 revenues by customer, by market and by segment. About 80% of its revenue is from the airline customers, 60% is line fit and 77% is within the commercial aircraft segment.
Now Slide 7 and 8 break down B/E's business by its commercial aircraft segment and business jet segment. Let's start with the commercial aircraft on Slide 7. You can see B/E's 4 key products within this segment are seating, galley inserts, oxygen and passenger service units, and interior structures. B/E is a product line leader, with strong share in first, business and premium economy and main cabin seating, and has won 40% to 50% of the business class and main cabin awards and orders over the past 2 years. 
B/E is also a product line leader in food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, referred to as galley inserts, and they have won 85% of the galley insert awards and orders over the past 2 years. They are the supplier of passenger oxygen systems for all Airbus and Boeing platforms currently in production. And finally, B/E is the supplier of Spacewall modular lavatory systems for the Boeing 737 aircraft. 
Turning now to Slide 8, let's take a look at B/E's business jet segment. Key products within this segment are super first class suites, business jet seating and interior lighting systems. B/E is a product line leader in bespoke customer super first class cabins. There, they were recently awarded a $260 million program for high-end suites, which sets a new industry standard and they have won more than 75% of super first class awards over the past couple of years. 
The company is a product line leader in all major seating categories including business jet, VIP aircraft and civilian helicopters. It is the sole source for Boeing 737 and Boeing 737 MAX cabin-- cabin lighting and does retrofit lighting on a number of aircraft as well. 
Turning now to Slide 9. You can see the impressive combination of Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace offering in the cockpit, cabin and aircraft exterior. The transaction broadens our portfolio with leading products in attractive segments that strengthens and broadens our airline relationships. With the addition of these capabilities, Rockwell Collins will have an increased ability to provide integrated offerings throughout the aircraft.
Turning now to Slide 10. As you can see, the company will be more diversified and in different ways than we are today. The combined company will have greater presence in the commercial air transport market. This will strengthen our aftermarket mix with more retrofit opportunities. And you can see in the diagram, our customer mix will be nicely balanced between U.S. and international. This transaction creates more resilient and diversified business, with greater earnings power and reduced volatility. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick Allen, and he's going to discuss the combined company's financial highlights. Patrick?"
603843,403754781,1059658,"Rockwell Collins Inc., 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2016",2016-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Collins Aerospace","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Slide 11 shows the combined company's pro forma financials. As you can see, the combined company would have generated approximately $8.1 billion of revenue and $1.9 billion in EBITDA through the 12 months ende",946,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Slide 11 shows the combined company's pro forma financials. As you can see, the combined company would have generated approximately $8.1 billion of revenue and $1.9 billion in EBITDA through the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. 
Both companies announced earnings results yesterday, so these are current numbers and do not reflect synergies and the combined earnings power of the 2 companies, which together we expect will create significantly even greater value in the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and talk about some of those synergies. The transaction is expected to generate run rate pretax cost synergies of approximately $160 million, which translates to $125 million after tax, due to some of the synergies coming from favorable tax jurisdictions. In addition, we expect to make certain conforming purchase accounting adjustments, which will benefit earnings by $60 million to $90 million per year for about 6 years. 
The sources of the cost synergies will come from elimination of duplicate public company costs and headquarters' consolidation, low-cost country manufacturing, supply chain savings, consolidation of IT systems and rationalization of our sales and customer support organization. We have a long history of successfully integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies, as you saw with our ARINC acquisition, and we have established a very clear path to realizing these savings.
Additionally, significant revenue synergies exist, which Kelly will talk about in more detail, but are not included and represent upside to our business case. The cost to achieve these synergies is about $120 million, the bulk of which will be incurred over the next 3 years.
Slide 13 provides some additional color about our near-term capital deployment. As always, we will continue to invest in organic growth. We will continue investing in research and development, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales of the combined organization. We plan to use a significant portion of our free cash flow to deleverage, and we expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be under 3 within 2 years. We plan to structure our financing with a $1.5 billion, 3-year, prepayable term loan to facilitate this plan.
And we remain focused on shareholder return and plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% of net income. We do not expect significant share repurchases over the next couple of years, just enough to offset dilution. Over time, as our leverage normalizes, we expect to resume our normal share repurchase program. And we're committed to maintaining strong liquidity and flexibility, and preserving an investment-grade rating, which we currently expect to be a solid BBB.
Now let me quickly summarize our earning results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on the following slides. Turning to Slide 15. We reported a strong Q4 with revenue of $1.4 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $1.58, a 14% increase compared to last year; and income from continuing operations of $208 million, a 13% increase. 
Our Government Systems business posted its first full year growth in 6 years, and closed out the year with fourth quarter sales growth of 14% and its highest-ever quarterly operating margin. We continue to see growth in our IMS segment in both the aviation and non-aviation businesses. Commercial Systems' air transport aviation electronics portfolio delivered a solid quarter of growth in OEM and aftermarket sales, while the business in regional aviation electronics portfolio continue to see weakness from the challenging business jet market conditions.
Our diluted average shares outstanding decreased from 133 million to 131 million due to our share repurchase program.
Now turning to Slide 16, I'd like to review briefly our full year 2016 results. We reported 2016 revenue of $5.3 billion, approximately flat year-over-year; EPS from continuing operations of $5.50, a 6% increase compared to last year; income from continuing operations of $727 million, a 5% increase; and operating cash flow from continuing operations of $723 million, which is down 3% year-over-year.
We are pretty pleased with these results in light of the challenging business market -- business jet market conditions. 
Now turning to Slide 17, I'll walk you through the guidance for 2017. Importantly, this is just for Rockwell Collins' base business and does not include any impact from our acquisition of B/E Aerospace, which, again, we plan to close in the spring of 2017. We will update the guidance over the coming months as we get a better sense of the timing of the close. 
With that said, for 2017, we plan to generate total sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, representing growth of about 2%. This reflects Government System sales growing low to mid-single digits and accelerating growth rate from 2016. We expect Commercial Systems revenues to be about flat, as benefits from market share gains in air transport offset further declines in bizjet OE revenues. And we expect Information Management Services to be up mid- to high- single digits. 
Our total segment operating margins are expected to be about 21%. Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, resulting in free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. Our R&D investment in 2017 is expected to be between $900 million and $950 million, and our full year income tax rate will be between 28% and 29%. 
Yesterday, B/E also reported results for the 3 and 9 months ended September 30. As reflected in the release, the company reported strong sales and earnings growth, and continues to build momentum going into 2017.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Kelly."

Now I want to walk through what I think could be the most exciting long-term benefits of the combination of the 2 companies, and that's our revenue synergies. As I said before, these all represent upside to our business case.
And we see 5 major areas of synergy. First area I'll talk about is the Business Aviation aftermarket. It'll be a prime area of focus for us. With more than 20,000 jets, we can offer a full complementary  of interiors from seating to lighting to electronics while aircraft are undergoing avionics modifications. And depending on the size of the aircraft, we could easily see between $200,000 to well over $1 million of opportunity per aircraft. Rockwell Collins' position on many military aircraft programs gives us an important access to customers, and this acquisition will allow us a broader offering to those customers. This is a channel that B/E currently just doesn't serve. 
Rockwell Collins has stronger OEM relationships, and that will aid further growth for standard interior sales. And likewise, B/E has stronger airline relationships that we think would generate opportunities for Rockwell Collins to sell more avionics; or likewise, opportunities where Rockwell Collins has strength to sell more interior equipment. If you think about that, these opportunities represent well over $50 million per opportunity. 
And finally, as you think about the transition to the next integrated digital airplane, perhaps the most exciting synergy is our combined portfolio will uniquely position us to integrate cabin products, smart network technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance aircraft uptime and airline profitability.
In summary, we are thrilled about this acquisition and the opportunities it provides to both companies' shareowners. Together, our company will be a leading supplier, with platforms for accelerated growth in new products and markets. The transaction is financially compelling and will allow us significant cost savings, and will deliver greater -- significantly greater value to our stakeholders than either company could on its own. Customers, employees, suppliers and shareowners will all benefit from this exciting combination. 
And I'll finish by adding my compliments to Amin and his team, who've done a tremendous job of building a leading franchise and creating value at B/E. We're eager to welcome the talented B/E Aerospace employees, and look forward to continuing to grow our business together. 
So let me turn the call back over to Ryan and we'll begin the Q&A."

And let me just explore that opportunity a little bit more to define what that is. Today, when aircraft come in for maintenance actions, that's when we typically will sell them avionics mods or even cabin entertainment, equipment mods and updates. And we do that through our pretty expansive dealer network. We've got over 300 dealers in the Business Aviation channel that help us do that. B/E currently doesn't have a dealer network. And in many cases, they don't have visibility to know those aircraft are coming in for mods and upgrades or maintenance actions, and so there's no point of sale for the interior products to let those customers know what the latest and greatest capabilities are. And as you can imagine, most of these customers are looking for some of the latest features and amenities that would go in the cabin, and we think it's going to be a great opportunity for us. When we know these folks are coming in for maintenance actions, their aircraft are going to be down for either a modification to the cabin systems or an avionics or even an engine overhaul, we can then upsell the cabin interiors to that. So as I look at that, I think that can have a meaningful increase, but almost double our opportunities as we do discretionary mods to -- with our current Avionics portfolio, because that's a [indiscernible]."

So let me give you a couple of figures of merit because I think they're important as you think about synergies. If you look at our content on the next-generation wide-body aircraft, if we combine B/E's content, it will triple our position, our content on programs like the 787, the A350, which we know are going to drive the preponderance of the future wide-body market. And it will nearly double our position in the narrow bodies. There are airline customers where B/E is extremely strong. We're not so strong, so there's opportunities for us with that expanded footprint to pull some Avionics opportunities. And likewise, there are airline customers where they are not as strong, but we do have strong Avionics positions that we could provide a broader offering to those customers. And I think if you think about that, as I talked in my prepared remarks, that's probably about a $50 million plus opportunity per major BFE selection or aircraft selection, probably more opportunity for the interiors than pulling the Avionics because of the relatively larger content that B/E has on an aircraft, but significant opportunities. And that's something that we've actually already seen with our ARINC acquisition, where there were airlines that they had a much stronger position with some of their services, and it just gave us access to better understand the needs and the demands and -- of those customers, and we've been able to pick up some share by doing that. So I think that's pretty exciting. And I will tell you, it doesn't require a lot of effort on our part. It's mostly channel management. We're talking about the existing product lines of both companies, so it's great upside for us, and we'll probably be able to prosecute those things pretty quickly."

We expect 90% of that $160 million to be achieved by our second full fiscal year, which is our fiscal 2019. And let me give you the 4, what I'll say, major financial drivers to those cost synergies, and it'll give you a perspective of the timing. The first is eliminating the duplicate public company costs and headquarters that Patrick outlined. That comes right away. That's pretty quick synergy. And that is pretty straightforward, as you can imagine, in a transaction like this. The second area is in supply chain savings, both direct supply chain, where we're buying materials that go in our end products; as well as indirect, where we're buying either consumables or things that we use, as well as services that we both buy externally. We think those savings are going to come pretty quickly as well. We've already got a detailed list of our supply chain overlap, where we expect to see synergies, and we based our synergies on previous supply chain consolidation that we've done. So I think that's pretty straightforward. And again, that will happen pretty quickly. We've got a plan that we'll be able to hit the ground running on those supply chain synergies. The third area is consolidation of our IT systems, and especially our manufacturing ERP system. And we'll start that right away, but that'll happen on a -- really a plant-by-plant basis. So that will feather in over time. The first plants will obviously provide the synergies faster, and that'll come in over the first 3 to 4 years. And then the last area is leveraging our low-cost country manufacturing and engineering capability. The engineering side is mostly around design centers in India. We both have India design centers in Hyderabad, which will give us opportunity to have some consolidation; but also further leverage that IDC, India Design Center, for low-cost engineering. And then as you can imagine, companies -- global companies like ours are continually looking at where and how we build our products and how we do that in the most efficient manner. Those will take a little bit more time as we shift to some low-cost country manufacturing. So I'd say, kind of upfront, you're going to see the elimination of the public cost, supply chain, start of the IT consolidation and then, over time, the full IT consolidation, and the low-cost country manufacturing and engineering will drive those synergies. Now we've got several others, but I would say they're -- these are the 4 meaningful areas of cost synergy."

First of all, let me just say this is a through cycle acquisition. We absolutely believe in the long-term nature of air traffic growth. B/E's business is much more driven to air traffic growth and airline profitability than what, I'll say, our core Rockwell Collins business is, which is more geared towards the cyclicality of OEM production. I really like that. I think it -- this acquisition actually balances us and provides us opportunities to go into the retrofit market. As you know, when aircraft OEMs lower aircraft production rate, the airlines will then look to upgrade their existing aircraft, and I believe we're coming into a major cycle where a lot of wide-bodies are coming off lease and will be returned to the lessors. And with that, we're going to see great opportunities for retrofit of the cabins because these systems, when the aircraft come back to the lessors, they need to be reconfigured for the new airlines that they're going to. That's just an opportunity we really don't see in our core business, so I really like the nature of the aftermarket revenues here. The other thing I'll say is we're both well-positioned on the wide-bodies that are going to drive the growth, with the A350 and the 787. We have, in this plan, taken a hard look at the overall cycle of the legacy wide-bodies, factored that into our outlook. I'll also say that we did extraordinarily deep due diligence on the B/E backlog. It's very robust, and I think that we feel very comfortable that this acquisition is going to manage its way through what will be -- we will see some softness, no question, in wide-body in near term, but there's no -- also no question for the long run, to deliver the traffic growth, you have to have wide-body aircraft. And for the long run, this acquisition will create a lot of value for us."

But clearly, there's some things that, as you look at our core business that factored into our thinking. One is that",591,"Yes. Well, the only thing I'd say is that it was a look at how to optimize as opposed to a defensive -- any kind of a defensive maneuver. But clearly, there's some things that, as you look at our core business that factored into our thinking. One is that we now have all the cockpits on Boeing's next-generation aircraft, which is providing us great growth between now and when the 777x comes in. But at that point, we aren't going to have as many opportunities to gain share as we already have 100% of that particular market share. Now there'll be some new airplanes, but to continue at the growth rate, we feel we needed a broader portfolio of offerings. Another factor is the business aviation OEM environment, as we all know. And we've seen, over the last several years, is it's questionable when that end market is going to recover. And I don't think, as I look at our core business, that we can be assured that that's going to be a growth engine for us going forward. Now we're not going to get out of that business. It's very important. We have -- get a lot of leverage across our other end markets. We use common product lines. It's a technology incubator for a lot of what we do. But again, as I look at how we're going to optimize the growth of the company, we felt we needed to have more opportunities to do that. So we did look at those 2 alternatives I outlined in my opening remarks. And I think one of the things about Rockwell Collins, while we've got a great technology base, if you talk to customers about what separates us in the marketplaces is the relationship, the -- they know we'll do what we say we're going to do. They trust us. They know we're going to support them and their customers and their long-term business opportunities. So we felt leveraging that capability was the best way to go, and looking at how to broaden our portfolio. And as I mentioned, one of the important criteria is as making sure as we broaden that portfolio, we broaden it with someone who, first of all, understands that portfolio, is well-positioned in the market, has enough scope and scale that we're assured success. And B/E is just a great fit, with all of their product lines being top in the market, a well-established -- look, this is not a -- they don't need a fix-up from Rockwell Collins. This is a well-run business with well-respected positions. But they're also at a time where they're being challenged by the customers to provide more, what I'll say, smart implementation of their equipment. You can kind of think of the future airplane that all of the galley equipment is going to be a node on the network, to either provide a better passenger experience, to allow the crew to interact differently with the passengers or for improved maintenance actions. And they're being pressed by their customers to bring us smart devices, smart cabin interior devices that integrate that capability. They don't have that, we do. We don't have the products, they do. So it's a really nice fit for us. And I think we're going to be uniquely positioned to work with both the airlines and the OEMs to help shape that and provide a more efficient, effective interior market for them going forward. So I see a lot of good things about this opportunity here today."

Having said that, I do believe there's opportunities for us to grow this portfolio in the military market. So I'm pretty excited about those opportunities. You know, if you think about Rockwell Collins, we actually do a lot of work in the cabins of military aircraft. It's mostly mission systems equipment that we put in, either air refueling, signals intelligence, communications networks, those type of things. But all those aircraft when they're getting modified, all the interior systems are needed and are being modified. So I think that the business will present some significant opportunities for us to grow the military market. And as that business recovers, we'll see some increase shift back to a little bit more balance there. You know, I don't have a view that we need to stay 50-50 commercial and defense. I think that the mix and the balance is much more important at the product line, that you need to have the scope and scale there to compete effectively at the product line. And so, I feel quite comfortable with the overall mix shift here going forward. And as I said in my other remark, we are absolutely a believer that air traffic is going to continue to grow at that 4% to 6% historical growth rate. And so while I'm sure there will be OEM fluctuations through that, in the long run, in order to deliver that traffic growth, there needs to be aircraft interiors and seats and all the things to do -- to deliver that. So I feel very comfortable with this move. And I think it diversifies us, as I said, with much more aftermarket opportunities. I really like the fact that the interiors get modified multiple times in the life of an aircraft. Our Avionics typically don't. Other than mandate updates, they tend to stay on wing through the full life of the airplane. So this really gives us a lot more retrofit opportunities, which when the OEM rates are being debated gives us other areas to offset that."
