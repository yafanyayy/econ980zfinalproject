AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.61 for the fourth quarter, and $12.55 and for the full year.

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.61 for the fourth quarter, and $12.55 and for the full year. Notwithstanding the declines in global equity indices, AMG generated strong results, including year-over-year earnings growth of 10% and excellent execution in our new investments area, with the addition of 6 outstanding new Affiliates which diversify and broaden our position in global equities and alternatives and enhanced the earnings power of our overall business.
With record earnings in 2015, AMG enters in 2016 in a very strong position. Our outstanding Affiliates are continuing to build on their excellent long-term performance track records, especially in alternatives and global equities. And through the addition of new Affiliates and the growth of our extend Affiliates, our business is now larger and more diverse across Affiliates, product areas and client geographies than ever before.
Obviously, the volatile market environment presents challenges for all asset management firms. But while none of us can predict future market movements, it is clear that the market dislocation and rising dispersion provides the best managers of alpha-oriented products with an opportunity to excel, and this is reflected in our Affiliate's excellent performance results in our alternative and active equity products in the last quarter and this quarter-to-date.
In addition, against the backdrop of uneven markets and lower returns, as there is increasing client demand for high connection to actively manage products. We are seeing strong demand for our Affiliates alternative strategies, and as global institutional clients increasingly allocate toward active products more generally, AMG is well positioned to benefit from this trend.
Although our net flows from the fourth quarter were impacted by several idiosyncratic factors, which as Nate will describe, we don't expect to reoccur, looking ahead, and in the current quarter, we are seeing strong momentum among institutional clients and much improved retail flows.  Going forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong earnings growth, consistent with our track record of growing earnings well in excess of market indices and industry averages over the short, medium and long term.
The drivers of our earnings growth include organic growth, especially in the higher fee alpha-oriented products, and the accretion from the investments where we have an unmatched competitive position as well as tremendous ongoing opportunities. 
In addition, our increasingly broad and diverse exposure to performance fee products gives us an asymmetric opportunity for earnings upside. While the substantial majority of our earnings from alternative products are in the form of management fees, often in long-term locked funds, we have a large, diverse and relatively uncorrelated array of performance fee products in liquid and in liquid strategies, spanning private equity, infrastructure, energy, credit, control equity, global macro, multi-strategy, relative value, managed futures and long/short equities.  And as we've added new Affiliates like Systematica, Ivory and Baring Asia, and existing Affiliates like AQR, and have increased their asset basis, the prospective earnings contribution from performance fees has become both larger and even more consistent.
Turning now to new investments. We were very pleased with the excellent execution of our strategy in 2015 with 5 new Affiliates added during the year, and the momentum has continued into 2016 as we announced our first investment of the year with the addition of Baring Asia a few weeks ago. Baring Asia is the largest dedicated Asian private equity firm with an exceptional 18-year track record of alpha generation and outstanding forward prospects.
The quality of our new Affiliates reflects the strength of our competitive advantage and partnering with the very best boutique firms globally. We are better positioned than ever to capitalize on our substantial forward opportunity set which is increasingly global, as demonstrated by the fact that our 4 most recent new Affiliates are based on 4 different continents.
Perspective Affiliates around the world have drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner over the past few [ph] decades as well as that prudent success of our global distributional platform. And the virtuous circle of our new investment strategy and global distribution capabilities continues to build on itself.  This virtuous circle is reinforced by the addition of differentiated, or in some cases, entirely new product areas to AMG's overall offering. 
AMG has a unique ability to add best-in-class, immediately salable products with long-term investment track records, and bringing them to new client audiences around the world. Having recently brought on board new Affiliates with outstanding product set that diversify and extend our aggregate offering, including in areas such as managed futures, global equities, long/short equities, Asian private equity and Asian real estate, all areas where we see significant demand both now and over the long term. Our client dialogue become richer and the overall franchise more valuable.
Looking back on 2015, we made substantial progress in building our business, and generated earnings growth which was strong on both in absolute and relative basis. While volatile markets create inevitable challenges, they also create opportunities. And over the past 2 decades, we have consistently demonstrated an ability to effectively manage some difficult environments and emerge with an even stronger franchise and competitive position.
With that, I'll turn it Nate to discuss our Affiliates in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a volatile market environment marked by rising dispersion across and within asset classes, our Affiliates and especially, our largest Affiliates, performed well relative to the benchmark and peers.But bef",1573,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a volatile market environment marked by rising dispersion across and within asset classes, our Affiliates and especially, our largest Affiliates, performed well relative to the benchmark and peers.
But before I cover our Affiliates performance in detail, I want to take a moment to describe the factors behind our net outflows in the fourth quarter and in particular, gives an insight into the positive flow momentum we're seeing now. First, in the fourth quarter, in the institutional channel, while we had significant quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement in net flows, we had large idiosyncratic outflows from several institutional clients that were unrelated to performance. Meaning that we're confident that the Affiliate performance was not the cause of the indiscernible]
Let me step back and put some of this into perspective. There was a recent industry research report that estimated the average so called petro-dollar related client AUM to be 4.1% of total AUM for a number of public asset managers. Our entire and many exposure to this category across our Affiliates is actually much lower at only half the average or roughly 2%. Performance is generally quite good, and in fact, some of these assets are in locked-up vehicle, so we believe our perspective volatility from these clients will be significantly less than the industry average.
Now moving from the institutional channel, all of my other high-level comments and flows relates to the Mutual Fund channel, or against the backdrop of industry-wide continued outflows from the U.S. equities, but we have a exposure to the mutual funds channel. Now against that backdrop, there were several significant one-off items in the quarter. 
First, like many of our U.S. fund industry peers material amount of year end tax distributions. Our estimate is roughly $800 million of tax distributions, net of the investing amount. Now while this is seasonal, this year was notable after 6 consecutive years of strong equity market returns. However, even more significant last quarter were the idiosyncratic outflows related to the liquidation of third revenue focused credit fund. To be clear, in the fourth quarter, we're recognizing 100% of the focused credit funds remaining assets as outflows. In addition to this fund's impact on the net flows in the quarter, all of the other funds within the revenue at the elevated outflows out to the announcement of the liquidation of focus credit and well. These total together almost $2.2 billion in the quarter.
Finally, we also have the determination of a large non-U.S. sub-advisory relationship across multiple products driven by internal client needs. Now looking ahead, while we do see active U.S. equity outflows continuing for the industry and AMG, the idiosyncratic items should be behind us, except for possibly ongoing reduced outflows and In fact, if you look across the publicly available data, inflows for our U.S. mutual fund business are a positive $830 million for the month of January. And that's coming especially from continued strength in our alternatives and global equity funds, combined with reduced outflows as these isolated issues from the fourth quarter get behind us, from the trajectory of our U.S. equities books and 
Looking ahead, and setting aside the idiosyncratic factors that impacted last quarter, with positive mutual fund flows in January, we're confident that our retail sales will be substantially better, and we see ongoing global momentum in our institutional business giving us strength in our Affiliates performance, combined with the additional several highly new Affiliate within demand product.
Now turning to investment performance for the fourth quarter and starting with the alternatives offerings. Our Affiliates alternatives category feature excellent long-term performance track records across a wide range of liquids and illiquid alternative strategies. As Sean noted, we've been increasingly broad and large-scale diverse set of alternative products that in the quarter, we added industry-leading Affiliates such as Systematica and Baring Asia. And the size of the alternative book as one of the largest Affiliates continues to scale. And Affiliates such as AQR, BlueMountain 
In terms of performance, and starting and the liquid side, in the quarter, a number of strategies in AQR delivered strong absolute and relative performance, notably Style Premia, Delta, and some of the beta products, long-short equity and equity market mutual. These strategies all have vehicle struck by MorningStar, and each on top decile or even top percentile rankings in their respective Morning Star categories both the quarter and full year 2015.
On the illiquid side, the turn from infrastructure offerings and call investments remain quite strong. And they continued to diversify our product set. For example, broadening from their successful infrastructure team into the new assets capabilities in 2015. On the other hand, value or equity had a challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they outperformed the number of their high-quality peers.
Next, moving to the global developed markets category. We doesn't both the quarter and the year across our international and global equities strategies as they added to their strong long-term records. AQR also extended their long-term track records with good performance in the quarter and year, while Artemis also had excellent returns for the year, although fourth quarter performance was next. While Tweedy Browne underperformed their benchmarks in the fourth quarter, they have performed very well versus peers and benchmarks with the market volatility in the current quarter, and now feature top quartile return for the 1 year and top decile returns for the over 3 year and longer time periods.  In addition, Tweedy Browne announced the reopening of the Global Value Fund 2 on February 1, as the having closed for the past 2 years and they have been getting the efforts introduced to put additional capital to work.
In the emerging markets category, for the broad industries, the fourth quarter was finished through a volatile year, our Affiliates have generated a strong levels return. Harding Loevner ahd good returns in both the quarter and the year, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated relative returns, investing in the emerging market well and emerging of market strategies, while Genesis was along the MCI index for the year, excellent relative returns over the longer term.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities. Performance across our Affiliates was mixed in the quarter, but each of Chicago equity frontier, GW&K and River Road and Time Square, continued or extended their good, longer-term performance track records. 
In the U.S. equity category, I also want to highlight Yetman. They underperformed in the quarter and for the full year 2015. However, they have posted a silent relative returns in the market volatility to this quarter so far. Featuring the top 2% or 3% year-to-date, and remaining with the first or second percentile performance in the entire 15-year time period but They also have recently reopened their products. And we believe, the recent dispersion in volatility that's providing them with an opportunity to put some of their high-level cash to work.
In fact, I'd like to also make a couple of broader comments about performance given the significant volatility we've seen at the start of the year. In general, a number of our largest Affiliates and their most significant products are meaningfully value-oriented, including AQR, indiscernible] Tweedy Browne, Yetman and including our broke managers, like Harding Loevner. These firms and their products are performing very well in a relative basis in this environment. And they should position them may extremely well to further extend their excellent long-term track records while the volatility in dispersion creates significant opportunities for them to put clients to work.
Now turning to more detailed look at flows for the quarter and by channel. As we all have say, both the institutional and advisory channels are fairly lumpy, and we certainly saw that this quarter. So in the institutional channel, we had significant sequential improvement in flows, with total net inflows of $253 million in the quarter. The themes in the quarter include the idiosyncratic outflows I mentioned earlier, but also very strong inflows in the quarter from alternative products, both liquid and illiquid, and fund in separate account forms. 
Now in the Mutual Fund channel, the outflows are $7.2 billion. As we mentioned earlier, this was driven by continued U.S. equity outflows consistent with the broader industry, as well as the seasonal net tax distribution and the Third Avenue recognized in the quarter. To repeat, we're taking 100% of the focus credit fund assets as outflows in the quarter. Finally, in my earlier comments, we also had several lumpy outflows in U.S. and global equities.
In our high net-worth channel, we had net inflows of $92 million in the quarter. Inflows were well partners Affiliates, as well as alternatives and new bond strategies, were partly offset by outflows from our U.S. equity and regional products, including brokers channels. 
Now maybe, 1 final point about flows and distribution. As Sean noted, the current volatility combined with an low return environment, increasing investors focus on active management, and especially, diversify such as a return. Our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide array of strategies, and the current environment is providing increasing opportunities to value of active management.  This excellent short and long-term performance reinforces our confidence in the significant positive flow generation opportunity, coming from both our Affiliates and selling efforts, as well as our complementary global distribution teams. 
With that, I'll turn to Jay."

As Sean mentioned, our 2015 results to demonstrate our ability to generate strong earnings even in periods of volatility and challenging market conditions.  The combination of our broad diversification return-oriented assets across Affiliates, client channels and geographies, and our investment structure which limits overexposure to the operating leverage at our Affiliates, provides a level of stability and our cash flows allowing us to execute our growth strategy throughout the market cycle. 
As you saw the release we reported economic earnings per share of $12.55 for 2015, an increase of 10% over 2014. For the fourth quarter, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.61, which included net performance fees of $0.75.  On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.72. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. Reported EBITDA of $942.2 million for 2015. For the fourth quarter, our EBITDA was $263.1 million, and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 17.2 basis points, or approximately 13.2 basis points excluding performance fees.  In the first quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.6 basis points which includes the full run rate impact of our new investments.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%, reflecting the benefits of a change in the U.K. tax rate. And our cash tax rate was approximately 22%. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the fourth quarter were $15.5 million, which was lower than expected as a result of the U.K. tax rate change, and we expect this number to return to approximately $22 million per quarter in 2016.
Our share of reported amortization for the fourth quarter was $28.6 million, which includes $8.1 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the first quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to $34 million due to the addition of new investments.
Our share of interest expense for the fourth quarter was $20.6 million. And in the first quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to increase to $22 million due to higher revolver balances from the financing of our new investments. Our other economic items for the fourth quarter were $2.5 billion. And as we before modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. With our substantial liquidity capacity, we've successfully executed on our new investment strategy and closed 3 new investments in the fourth quarter, and 2 new Affiliates; Systematica and bearing, in January. In addition, we repurchased 34 million in shares in the quarter, bringing our total to approximately $366 million for the year. 
With strong recurring free cash flow generated from the scale and diversity of our business, combined with prudent leverage in low cost of capital, we are well positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Now turning to guidance. We are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.40 to $14. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter, and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter of 2016. We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and a mix of Affiliate confirmation to our earnings.  Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earning contributions of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we will be happy to answer your questions."

And as Nate described, we see ongoing momentum and based on the -- to some extent, early anecdotal data and commentary that we see from talking to clients and clients describing their own strategic positioning, we think that, as we said earlier, it's even more going to be a period of favoring active equity and alternatives going forward, obviously -- the ones that generate alpha and the ones that have a track record of being able to sell their products effectively on a global basis. And that's all that we have been doing. I think we had a period -- we got 2 quarters with idiosyncratic events, one around large clients who are redeeming for nonperformance-related reasons. And I think Nate described the extents to which our ongoing exposure is much more limited than our peers. And given the remaining products, we feel as good as we can feel, include some of the products, long-term love to vehicles, we feel as good as we can feel about the exposure there. We had a tough period in retail, especially U.S. retail, and I think that's largely fast us in the early trends, certainly from performance standpoint, as well as from a flow standpoint through the first month. But I think we've got good month and I'm -- I think that's good and absolute basis, but also very good on a relative basis. And of course, we had another one-off event around Third Avenue and the closing of that fund. And there, the flows have moderated, as Nate described it. And so looking forward, we are very optimistic about a resumption of the kind of momentum that we've shown and demonstrated over the past 5 years and nothing that we see, nothing that we can't see is at all at odds with that."

It's probably not quite as weighted toward global and alternative as it was last year. But we had a terrific result last year and especially for the last quarter. And so while there's -- as many times in the past, the deals tend to come and in clumps and it's very difficult to forecast quarter-to-quarter. I would say that any pause -- that you might see would be around market volatility and just the accident of timing. On an overall basis, we couldn't be more positive about our prospects for continued accretion from new investments going forward.

I'm putting in perspective that weighted average share count for this year, 2015 was 55.1 million, and last year was 56.3 million. So we're taking of 1 million to -- 1 million a quarter over the last 2 years.

Sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Maybe, I'll just start with the guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what would the update in the guidance 2016 ra",804,"Yes. Sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Maybe, I'll just start with the guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what would the update in the guidance 2016 range of $12.40 to $14 -- it was based on the mark-to-market of our AUMs since our last call. It will -- it's included the inclusion of Baring Asia which was the new transaction because on November 9 when we last gave guidance, we had already announced the other 3, so we included Baring Asia and its accretion in the full -- by the full year effect from 2016. And we also updated our performance fee assumptions for the year given the addition of Systematica and Baring Asia and Ivory, all of this have performance fees. So those 3 things were the main items that we updated and reflected on. Starting with the building block on market data, since we gave that guidance in November 9 through the end of the year, well, starting with -- as of November 9, we were up about 4% in the quarter. And as you can see from our AUM table, we finished up about 2%. So the delta between November 9 and the end of the year was minus 2%. Then, quarter-to-date through February 1, so since the end of the year to know, we experienced another 4% down, in line with broader markets. So if you add a negative 2% and 4%, you get a minus 6%. And then lastly, reminding you of our modeling convention. We assume no more market data in this current quarter. So we removed our model convention of 2% for this quarter. So the change, the full change was down 8%, and part of that was model convention. But thereafter, we grow it 2%. So it's the second, third and fourth quarter at 2%. So that's the underlying assumption for beta for the rest of the year. And then we when you think about Baring, because it closed on January 4, we really get the full year effect of Baring in our earnings accretion that, that's partially offset that market change that I just mentioned. And then on performance fees, so let me address that. So with the growth in our existing alternative products, more broadly, combined with the addition of the new products from Systematica, Baring Asia and Ivory, these products have low or no correlation to our existing product sets. We expect our performance fee opportunity to grow modestly as a percentage of our earnings base. And as Sean has said, we are confident in the consistency of this earnings journey given the diversity and the correlation of the performance generating products. So as a result, at a midpoint of our range, we see the level of performance fees, that's approximately 10% of our earnings. And as we've always said in the past, we feel great about the base level of performance fees in any year, the breadth and diversity of the performance fee product set creates this positive asymmetry that Sean mentioned increasing the probability of achieving low end of the guidance range. And at the high end reflects a greater expect value that we could experience given this scale on diversity. And then finally, just reminding you that relative to, say, some of the publicly-traded alternative firms, we take a different approach to performance fee accounting. We only recognize them in earnings when we realized them in cash in the period in which we experience them. So now getting to your question of funding, and so we closed 2 after the end of the quarter, and our balance on the revolver was just 2 -- $200 million [ph] just under $300 million. I think I had mentioned, we thought it was going to be closer to being $500 million, but systematically closed right after the end of the quarter, and then of course, Baring came on after that. So in the first quarter, the revolver balance will be half -- roughly, half of our full revolver of $1.3 billion, so call at 650  to 700 is where we would expect revolver balance to be as we get through this quarter. More broadly, as it relates to funding, we, of course, have episodic new investments. And so as you episodic, we may increase our leverage might say for short period, but given our strong free recurring cash flow, we're able to reduce that leverage very quickly in really, 1 quarter or 2. So as a result, we really have the flexibility to continue to do deals throughout this whole year. And our long-term sort of target leverage is at 2 or less and we'll maintain that as we go through the year."

But I think it is highly likely given the volatility and dispersion that this will be a period where -- and I think, perhaps, for a while, we're active -- the best active, strongly outperforms passive. And I think you've heard -- I've heard some of my peers in the industry say the same thing, including firms where they have significant passive exposure. And so we're believing that, and it is -- it follows logically from the environment and from the track record of firms. And our exposure has been -- is very heavily focused on alpha-generating products the alpha side of the barbell, high conviction, active equity managers and alternative managers, and a broad diverse array of alternative. And so we are ideally positioned for an environment like this, having had 5 years of industry-leading organic growth and flows in a period which was much more challenging for these kinds of products.

So I think in the -- restating the obvious, right, I think as we enter a period within some of the best managers are now starting to say they can find value again, although not all of them, right? But some of them are starting to say they can find value again, I called out in my prepared remarks but [indiscernible] management, for example, that products have been close for over 2 years, not because people didn't want to get the money of their cash balances, they're growing and they needed to be able to put the for existing money to work for existing clients first. And it is now decided to reopen  their -- one of their global funds, and they're finding things to invest in. And that will take the cycle which is -- as they find things to invest in, and as performance goes well and they're open to new money, they'll be gathering flows.

And so I think it is probable that there is some further redemption and shrinkage is through the -- through this period. But I see over time a little bit, as market trends sort of favor them, as we were just discussing around the opportunities for deep value managers but of course, they're going to have to generate excellent performance as they have in the past. And as they do that, we see them bottoming and then recovering. And as I said, have every confidence in their ability to do that. But stepping back in may be reframing a little bit, just to put this in context for AMG, Third Avenue is, from a run rate earnings contribution standpoint, 1% of our earnings. So really, no impact to AMG's financials from their results. And you didn't ask this, but to the extent anybody has a question, we don't think that Third Avenue has any legal exposure around the focus credit fund closure, et cetera, but we are completely comfortable that AMG has no legal exposure at all given our structure and approach. And so going forward, while it is it has been a difficult period for Third Avenue, and obviously, attracted a lot of of publicity and perhaps, a lot of uncertainty around any potential exposure to AMG.

I think we also need to think about the fact or set of things that are not necessarily sort of legally locked structures but where from sense in terms and purposes, they're sort of very, very stable as a basis, separate account, sort of GP funded kind of structure. And that's a significant portion of our alternatives book. On -- when you check about the funds rating pipeline, it's a source of particular strength for us, right? So right now, we're having good traction or exceptional traction on the liquids side and -- weak funds like AQR in our existing Affiliates group, they've done a fantastic job. And if you look at new Affiliates from Systematica, there are opportunities there. And very strong so the opportunity out there is really extraordinary.

And also, if you'll see, continued product development, frankly, in both sides with liquid and illiquid.

If you look in the last 4 to 5 years and look at current client trends on a retail basis but also a institutional, which is of course, more of the focus of our overall business, it's been a period which has favored passive products. So retail investors increasingly moving from active to passive equity exposure but also, a similar trend in a different way.

And through that whole period, we've had extremely strong flows on the back of excellent performance by our self oriented Affiliates as well as excellent results in our alternative products which are sort of away from the question that I think you're posing.

And therefore, I think there's every reason for us to feel confident and we do feel confident that going forward, our active equity Affiliates are continuing -- are going to continue to do well and maybe even see accelerating flows.

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.61 for the fourth quarter, and $12.55 for the full year. Notwithstanding declines in global equity indices, AMG generated strong results, including year-over-year earnings growth of 10% and excellent execution in our new investments area, with the addition of 6 outstanding new Affiliates which diversify and broaden our position in global equities and alternatives and enhanced the earnings power of our overall business.
With record earnings in 2015, AMG enters 2016 in a very strong position. Our outstanding Affiliates are continuing to build on their excellent long-term performance track records, especially in alternatives and global equities. And through the addition of new Affiliates and the growth of our extend Affiliates, our business is now larger and more diverse across Affiliates, product areas and client geographies, than ever before.
Obviously, the volatile market environment presents challenges for all asset management firms. But while none of us can predict future market movements, it is clear that the market dislocation and rising dispersion provide the best managers of alpha-oriented products with an opportunity to excel, and this is reflected in our Affiliate's excellent performance results in alternative and active equity products in the last quarter and this quarter-to-date.
In addition, against the backdrop of uneven markets and lower returns, there is increasing client demand for high conviction to actively manage products. We are seeing strong demand for our Affiliates' alternative strategies, and as global institutional clients increasingly allocate toward active products more generally, AMG is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
Although our net flows from the fourth quarter were impacted by several idiosyncratic factors, which as Nate will describe, we don't expect to reoccur. Looking ahead, and in the current quarter, we are seeing strong momentum among institutional clients and much improved retail flows.  Going forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong earnings growth, consistent with our track record of growing earnings well in excess of market indices and industry averages over the short, medium and long term.
The drivers of our earnings growth include organic growth, especially in the higher fee alpha-oriented products, and the accretion from new investments where we have an unmatched competitive position as well as tremendous ongoing opportunities. 
In addition, our increasingly broad and diverse exposure to performance fee products gives us an asymmetric opportunity for earnings upside. While the substantial majority of our earnings from alternative products are in the form of management fees, often in long-term locked funds we have a large, diverse and relatively uncorrelated array of performance fee products in liquid and illiquid strategies, spanning private equity, infrastructure, energy, credit, control equity, global macro, multi-strategy, related value, managed futures and long/short equities.  And as we've added new Affiliates like Systematica, Ivory, and Baring Asia, and existing Affiliates like AQR, BlueMountain, and ValueAct have increased their asset bases, their prospective earnings contribution from performance fees has become both larger and even more consistent.
Turning now to new investments. We were very pleased with the excellent execution of our strategy in 2015 with 5 new Affiliates added during the year, and the momentum has continued into 2016 as we announced our first investment of the year with the addition of Baring Asia a few weeks ago. Baring Asia is the largest dedicated Asian private equity firm with an exceptional 18-year track record of alpha generation and outstanding forward prospects.
The quality of our new Affiliates reflect the strength of our competitive advantage and partnering with the very best boutique firms globally. We are better positioned than ever to capitalize on our substantial forward opportunity set which is increasingly global, as demonstrated by the fact that our 4 most recent new Affiliates are based on 4 different continents.
Perspective Affiliates around the world are drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner over the past few decades as well as the proven success of our global distribution platform. And the virtuous circle of our new investment strategy and global distribution capabilities continues to build on itself.  This virtuous circle is reinforced by the addition of differentiated, or in some cases, entirely new product areas to AMG's overall offering. 
AMG has the unique ability to add best-in-class, immediately salable products with long-term investment track records, and bring them to new client audiences around the world. Having recently brought on board new Affiliates with outstanding product sets that diversify and extend our aggregate offering, including in areas such as managed futures, global equities, long/short equities, Asian private equity and Asian real estate, all areas where we see significant demand both now and over the long term, our client dialogues become richer and the overall franchise more valuable.
Looking back on 2015, we made substantial progress in building our business, and generated earnings growth which was strong on both in absolute and relative basis. While volatile markets create inevitable challenges, they also create opportunities. And over the past 2 decades, we have consistently demonstrated an ability to effectively manage some difficult environments and emerge with an even stronger franchise and competitive position.
With that, I'll turn it Nate to discuss our Affiliates in more detail."

Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a volatile market environment marked by rising dispersion across and within asset classes, our Affiliates and especially, our largest Affiliates, performed well, relative to their benchmarks and peers.
But before I cover our Affiliate performance in detail, I want to take a moment to describe the factors behind our net outflows in the fourth quarter and in particular, give us an insight into the positive flow momentum we're seeing now. First, in the fourth quarter, in the institutional channel, while we had significant quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement in net flows, we had large idiosyncratic outflows from several institutional clients that were unrelated to performance, meaning that we're confident that the Affiliate performance was not the cause of the intervention. 
Let me step back and put some of this into perspective. There was a recent industry research report that estimated the average, so called, petro-dollar related client AUM to be 4.1% of total AUM for a number of public asset managers. Our entire AUM exposure to this category across our Affiliates is actually much lower at only half the average or roughly 2%. Performance is generally quite good, and in fact, some of these assets are in locked-up vehicles, so we believe our perspective for volatility from these clients will be significantly less than the industry average.
Now moving from the institutional channel, all of my other high-level comments on flows relates to the Mutual Fund channel, or against the broad backdrop of industry-wide continued outflows from U.S. equities, but we have a trail exposure to the mutual funds channel. Now against that backdrop, there were several significant one-off items in the quarter. 
First, like many of our U.S. fund industry peers, we had a material amount of year end tax distributions. Our estimate is roughly $800 million of tax distribution, net of the main invested amount. Now while this is seasonal, this year was notable after 6 consecutive years of strong equity market returns. However, even more significant last quarter were the idiosyncratic outflows related to the liquidation of the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund. To be clear, in the fourth quarter, we're recognizing 100% of the focused credit funds remaining assets as outflows. In addition to this fund's impact on the net flows in the quarter, all of the other funds with that avenue are having outflows after the announcement of the liquidation in focused-credit and well. These total together almost $2.2 billion in the quarter.
Finally, we also have the termination of a large non-U.S. sub-advisory relationship across multiple products driven by internal client needs. Now looking ahead, while we do see active U.S. equity outflows continuing for the industry and AMG, the idiosyncratic items should be behind us, except for possibly some ongoing but reduced outflows that are inevitable. In fact, if you look across publicly available data, inflows for our U.S. mutual fund business are a positive $830 million for the month of January. And that's coming especially from continued strength in our alternatives in global equity funds, combined with reduced outflows as these isolated issues from the fourth quarter to get behind us, from the trajectory of our U.S. equities books encrypts. 
Looking ahead, and setting aside the idiosyncratic factors that impacted last quarter, with positive mutual fund flows in January we're confident that our retail sales will be substantially better, and we see ongoing good momentum in our institutional business, giving us strength of our Affiliates performance, combined with the additional several high quality new Affiliates with in-demand products sets.
Now turning to investment performance for the fourth quarter, and starting with the alternatives offerings. Our Affiliates in alternatives category feature excellent long-term performance track records across a wide range of liquid and illiquid alternative strategies. As Sean noted, we've an increasingly broad and large-scale diverse set of alternative products, and in the quarter we added industry-leading Affiliates such as Systematica and Baring Asia, and the size of the alternative book as some of our largest Affiliates continues to scale. And Affiliates such as AQR, BlueMountain and [indiscernible]. 
In terms of performance, and starting on the more liquid side. In the quarter a number of strategies in AQR delivered strong, absolute and relative performance, notably Style Premia, Delta, and [indiscernible] beta products, long-short equity and equity market mutual. And these strategies all have vehicles tracked by MorningStar, and each are in top decile or even top percentile rankings in their respective Morning Star categories both the quarter and full year 2015.
On the illiquid side, returning from -- the returns from Campion infrastructure offerings and call investments remains quite strong. And they continued to diversify the product head. For example, broadening from their successful infrastructure team into new assets capabilities in 2015. On the other hand, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they outperformed the number of their high-quality peers.
Next, moving to the global developed markets category. Harding Loevner continues to deliver good returns in both the quarter and the year across our international and global equities strategies, as they added to their strong long-term records. AQR also extended their long-term track records with good performance in the quarter and year, while Artemis also had excellent returns for the year, although fourth quarter performance was next. While Tweedy, Browne underperformed their benchmarks in the fourth quarter, they have performed very well versus peers and benchmarks in the market volatility in the current quarter, and now feature top quartile returns for the 1 year and top decile returns over 3 year and longer time periods.  In addition, Tweedy, Browne announced the reopening of their Global Value Fund 2 on February 1 after the having closed, close for the past 2 years and they have been giving us the opportunities to put additional capital to work.
In the emerging market category. For the broad industry, the fourth quarter was a muted-finished to a volatile year. Our Affiliates however generated strong levels of returns. Harding Loevner posted good returns in both the quarter and year, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good relative returns, in both their emerging markets well and emerging market strategies, while Genesis was along with the MSCI Em Index for the year, posting excellent relative returns over the longer term.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities. Performance across our Affiliates was mixed in the quarter, but each of Chicago equity frontier, GW&K, River Road and TimesSquare, continued or extended their good, longer-term performance track records. 
In the U.S. equity category, I also wanted to highlight Yacktman. They underperformed in the quarter and for the full year 2015. However, they have posted excellent relative returns in the market volatility to this quarter so far. Featuring the top 2% or 3% year-to-date, and remaining with first or second percentile performance in the entire 15-year time period still. They also have recently reopened their products. And we believe, the recent dispersion in volatility is providing them with an opportunity to put some of their high-level cash to work.
In fact, I'd like to also make a couple of broader comments about performance given the significant volatility we've seen at the start of the year. In general, a number of our largest Affiliates and their most significant products are meaningfully value-oriented, including AQR; Campion; Tweedy, Browne; Yacktman and including our quality growth managers, like Harding Loevner. These firms and their products are performing very well on a relative basis in this environment. And this should position them may extremely well to further extend their excellent long-term track records, while the volatility in dispersion create significant opportunities for them to put client items to work.
Now turning to more detailed look at flows for the quarter and by channel. As we always say, both in both the institutional and sub-advisory channels are apparently lumpy, and we certainly saw that this quarter. So in the institutional channel, we had significant sequential improvement in flows, with total net inflows of $253 million in the quarter. The themes in the quarter include the idiosyncratic outflows I mentioned earlier, but also very strong inflows in the quarter from alternative products, both in liquid and illiquid, and fund in separate account forms. 
Now in the Mutual Fund channel, the outflows are $7.2 billion. As we mentioned earlier, this was driven by continued U.S. equity outflows consistent with the broader industry, as well as the seasonal net tax distribution and the Third Avenue flows we recognized in the quarter. To repeat, we're taking 100% of the focused-credit fund assets as outflows in the quarter. Finally, consistent with my earlier comments, we also had several lumpy [indiscernible] to outflows in U.S. and global equities.
In our high net-worth channel, we had net inflows of $92 million in the quarter. Inflows were in wealth partners Affiliates, as well as alternatives and new useful bond strategies, were probably offset by outflows from our U.S. equity and regional products, including brokers channels. 
Now maybe, 1 final point about flows and distribution. As Sean noted, the current volatility combined with an ongoing low return environment are increasing investors focus on active management, and especially, diversifying sources of return. Our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide array of strategies, and the current environment is providing increasing opportunities to show the value of active management.  This excellent short and long-term performance reinforces our confidence in the significant positive flow generation opportunity coming from both our Affiliates and selling efforts, as well as our complementary global distribution teams. 
With that, I'll turn it to Jay."

As Sean mentioned, our 2015 results demonstrate our ability to generate strong earnings even in periods of volatility and challenging market conditions.  The combination of our broad diversification return-oriented assets across Affiliates, client channels and geographies, and our investment structure which limits our exposure to the operating leverage at our Affiliates, provides a level of stability in our cash flows, allowing us to execute on our growth strategy throughout the market cycle. 
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $12.55 for 2015, an increase of 10% over 2014. For the fourth quarter, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.61, which included net performance fees of $0.75.  On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.72. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. We reported EBITDA of $942.2 million for 2015. For the fourth quarter, our EBITDA was $263.1 million, and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 17.2 basis points, or approximately 13.2 basis points excluding performance fees.  In the first quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.6 basis points which includes the full run rate impact of our new investments.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%, reflecting the benefit of a change in the U.K. tax rate. And our cash tax rate was approximately 22%. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the fourth quarter were $15.5 million, which was lower than expected as a result of the U.K. tax rate change, and we expect this number to return to approximately $22 million per quarter in 2016.
Our share of reported amortization for the fourth quarter was $28.6 million, which includes $8.1 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the first quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to $34 million due to the addition of new investments.
Our share of interest expense with fourth quarter was $20.6 million. And in the first quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to increase to $22 million due to higher revolver balances from the financing of our new investments. Our other economic items for the fourth quarter were $2.5 million, and as we look forward for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. With our substantial liquidity capacity, we successfully executed on our new investment strategy and closed 3 new investments in the fourth quarter, and 2 new Affiliates, Systematica and Bearing, in January. In addition, we repurchased 34 million in shares in the quarter, bringing our total to approximately $366 million for the year. 
With strong, recurring free cash flow generated from the scale and diversity of our business, combined with prudent leverage in low cost of capital, we are well-positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Now turning to guidance. We are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.40 to $14. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter, and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter of 2016. We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance, and a mix of Affiliate confirmation to our earnings.  Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earning contributions of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we will be happy to answer your questions."

We had 21 straight quarters of positive flows, industry-leading -- in many cases on an absolute basis but if you think that -- think about it, that from the standpoint of the product composition, for us, the flows are pretty much all active equities and alternatives. And the rest of the industry, as you know, is almost all passive and fixed income. And so that engine of organic growth continues. And as Nate described, we see ongoing momentum and based on the -- to some extent, early anecdotal data and commentary that we see from talking to clients and clients describing their own strategic positioning, we think that, as we said earlier, it's even more going to be a period of favoring active equity and alternatives going forward, obviously -- the ones that generate alpha and the ones that have a track record of being able to sell their products effectively on a global basis. And that's all that we've been doing. I think we had a period -- we got 2 quarters with idiosyncratic events, one around large clients who are redeeming for nonperformance-related reasons. And I think Nate described the extent to which our ongoing exposure is much more limited than our peers. And given the remaining products, we feel as good as we can feel, include some of the products, we've seen long-term locked vehicles, we feel as good as we can feel about the exposure there. We had a tough period in retail, especially U.S. retail, and I think that's largely passed us in their early trends, certainly from performance standpoint, as well as from a flow standpoint through the first month. Well I think we've had a good month and I'm not -- I think that's good on an absolute basis, but also very good on a relative basis. And then of course, we had another one-off event around Third Avenue and the closing of that fund. And there, the flows have moderated, as Nate described. And so looking forward, we are very optimistic about a resumption of the kind of momentum that we'd shown and demonstrated over the past 5 years and nothing that we see -- nothing that we can't see is at all at odds with that. ."

It's probably not quite as weighted toward global and alternative as it was last year. But we had a terrific result last year and especially for the last quarter. And so while there's -- as we has said many times in the past, the deals tend to come in clumps and it's very difficult to forecast quarter-to-quarter. I would say that any pause -- that you might see would be around market volatility and just the accident of timing.

The actual share repurchases will be based on what we see in both new investments and capital management as it relates to share repurchase, so if more or less than that, but again, just model convention. I'm putting in perspective that weighted average share count for this year, 2015 was $55.1 million, and last year was $56.3 million.

So sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Let me, maybe, I'll just start with guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what would the update in the guidance",809,"Yes. So sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Let me, maybe, I'll just start with guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what would the update in the guidance 2016 range of $12.40 to $14 -- it was based on the mark-to-market of our AUMs since our last call. It will -- it's included the inclusion of Baring Asia which was the new transaction. Because on November 9, when we last gave guidance, we had already announced the other 3, so we included Baring Asia and its accretion in the full -- for the full year effect from 2016. We also updated our performance fee assumption for the year given the addition of Systematica and Baring Asia and Ivory, all of which have performance fees. So those 3 things were the main items that we updated and reflected on. Starting with the building block on market data, since we gave the guidance on November 9 through the end of the year, well, starting with -- as of November 9, we were up about 4% in the quarter. And as you can see from our AUM table, we finished up about 2%. So the delta between November 9 and the end of the year was minus 2%. Then, quarter-to-date through February 1, so since the end of the year to now, we experienced another 4% down, in line with broader markets. So if you add a negative 2% and 4%, you get a minus 6%. And then lastly, reminding you of our modeling convention. We assume no more market data in this current quarter. So we removed our model convention of 2% for this quarter. So the change, the full change was down 8%, and part of that was model convention. But thereafter, we grow it 2%. So it's the second, third and fourth quarter at 2%. So that's the underlying assumption for beta for the rest of the year. And then when you think about Baring, because it closed on January 4, we really get the full year effect of Baring in our earnings accretion that does partially offset that market change that I just mentioned. And then on performance fees, so let me address that, with the growth in our existing alternative products, more broadly, combined with the addition of the new products from Systematica, Baring Asia and Ivory, these products have low or no correlation to our existing product sets. We expect our performance fee opportunity to grow modestly as a percentage of our earnings base. And as Sean has said, we are confident in the consistency of this earnings stream given the diversity and the correlation of the performance fee generating products. So as a result, at a midpoint of our range, we see the level of performance fees, is at approximately 10% of our earnings. And as we've always said in the past, we feel great about the base level of performance fees in a year, the breadth and the diversity of the performance fee product set creates this positive asymmetry that Sean mentioned, increasing the probability of achieving the low end of the guidance range. And at the high end it reflects a greater expected value that we could experience given the scale on diversity. And then finally, just reminding you that relative to, say, some of the publicly traded alternative firms, we take a different approach to performance fee accounting. We only recognize them in earnings when we realize them in cash in the period in which we experience them. So now getting to your question of funding, so we closed 2 after the end of the quarter, and our balance on the revolver was just 2 -- $200 million, under $300 million. I think I'd mentioned, we thought it was going to be closer to being $500 million, but systematically closed right after the end of the quarter, and then of course, Baring came on after that. So in the first quarter, the revolver balance will be half -- roughly half of our full revolver of $1.3 billion, so call it $650 million to $700 million is where we would expect revolver balance to be as we get through this quarter, more broadly, as it relates to funding, we, of course, have episodic new investments. And so as new investments occur episodically, we may increase our leverage modestly for short periods, but given our strong free recurring cash flow, we're able to reduce that leverage very quickly, in really, 1 quarter or 2. So as a result, we really have the flexibility to continue to do deals throughout this whole year. And our long term sort of target leverage is at 2 or less and we'll maintain that as we go through the year."

But I think it is highly likely given the volatility and dispersion that this will be a period where -- and I think, perhaps, for a while, we're active -- the best active, strongly outperforms passive. And I think you've heard -- I've heard some of my peers in the industry say the same thing, including firms where they have significant passive exposure.

So I think in the -- restating the obvious, right, I think as we enter a period within there's -- some of the best managers are now starting to say they can find value again, although not all of them, right? But some of them are starting to say they can find value again, I called out in my prepared remarks but we, management, for example, that the products have been close for over 2 years, not because people didn't want to get the money of their cash balances, they're growing and they needed to be able to put the money to work for existing clients first. And they'd now decided to reopen their -- one of their global funds, and they're finding things to invest in. And that will take the cycle which is -- as they find things to invest in, and as performance goes well and they're open to new money, they'll be gathering flows. And I do think that cycle, that growth value cycle -- there will be a cycle to it, and flows will definitely follow."

Maybe Nate would have it. But there's a clear trend toward the outflows moderating. As clients focus again on the outstanding long-term record of Third Avenue's products, especially their flagship real estate product, which obviously is completely unrelated to and away from the focus credit product, so the management team has more than a decade, on average of experience. And we feel terrific about the firm's prospects and their financial and operating position. They're extremely well reserved. And so I think it is probable that there is some further redemption and shrinkage through the -- through this period. But I see over time, a little bit, as market trends sort of favor them, as we were just discussing around the opportunities for deep value managers, but of course they're going to have to generate excellent performance as they have in the past. And as they do that, we see them bottoming and then recovering. And as I said, have every confidence in their ability to do that. But stepping back in may be reframing a little bit, just to put this in context for AMG, Third Avenue is, from a run rate earnings contribution standpoint, 1% of our earnings. So really, no impact to AMG's financials from their results. And you didn't ask this, but to the extent anybody has a question, we don't think that Third Avenue has any legal exposure around the focus credit fund closure, et cetera, but we are completely comfortable that AMG has no legal exposure at all given our structure and approach. And so going forward, while it is, it's been a difficult period for Third Avenue, and obviously, attracted a lot of publicity and perhaps, a lot of uncertainty around any potential exposure to AMG. I -- hopefully, these comments make that crystal clear."

I think we also need to think about the fact or set of things that are not necessarily sort of legally locked structures, but where from pension purposes, they're sort of very, very stable as a basis, separate account, sort of GP funded one kind of structure. And that's a significant portion of our alternatives book. On -- when you check about the fund raising pipeline, it's a source of particular strength for us, right? So right now, we're having good traction or exceptional traction on the liquids side, unique funds like AQR in our existing Affiliate group, they've done a fantastic job. And if you look at new Affiliates from Systematica and the opportunities there, that's a very strong with macro results. So the opportunity set there is really extraordinary. And then on the illiquid side, I'd sort of call out firms like Pantheon, where they've got good -- they have had a really good year. The forward opportunity set looks very, very good, both in the sort of the traditional private equity primaries and secondaries, but also, they have really broadened out their capabilities and infrastructure. And now I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks in real assets. And those are really high demand product areas, the track record, early track record is very, very good, and they think they can put a lot of assets to work. And also, if you'll see, continued product development, frankly, in both sides, liquid and illiquid. And as we've talked about in prior calls, I think we are very well positioned to help these firms as they bring new products to market because of the sort of the quality of engagement we have with the marketplace, both on the institutional side, right? And that we have these good dialogues worldwide, but also, in the packaging, in bringing product to the retail marketplace. And again, the example I'll highlight here, last year was bringing the Pantheon private equity capability set to the DC marketplace, both in CIT and mutual fund form. And sort of first clients demanded there -- first DC clients demanded there. And I think that's the kind of business where both -- we can add a lot of value, and we're going to see a little bit growth. But in some, the new business pipeline for our alternatives set, liquid and illiquid, is really good."

So which is a very institutional sell, where we're leveraging, they're already very strong distribution capabilities, but we are having geographical filling. Good contrast that with a firm like the SouthernSun or River Road. SouthernSun, very quickly, integrated them into our retail distribution. But again, when we experienced there, it's very hard -- there's no sort of here it's the base case. But they are fully integrated into our retail distribution and working day 1 with a firm like River, where we actually knew on the distribution side already. And so we're working with and have done some thing from the product development and also extending their product distribution into the [indiscernible] where they or we're not working with them instead of [indiscernible] . So even the short answer is we're making really good progress of all those firms integrating them in.

If you look in the last 4 to 5 years and look at client trends on a retail basis, but also institutional, which is of course, more of the focus of our overall business, it's been a period which has favored passive products. So retail investors increasingly moving from active to passive equity exposure, but also, at the similar trend in a different way. And obviously, it expresses itself quite differently from one institutional client to another. But I would say there has been broadly, a similar kind of trend among institutions. And through that whole period, we've had extremely strong flows on the back of excellent performance by our alpha-oriented Affiliates as well as excellent results in our alternative products, which are sort of away from the question that I think you're posing. Looking forward, I think that the trends are much more likely to favor active managers, high conviction, high-performing alpha-oriented managers, for sure. And therefore, I think there's every reason for us to feel confident. We do feel confident that going forward, our active equity Affiliates are continuing to -- are going to continue to do well and in deed maybe even see accelerating flows.

We think that those trends remain intact and then if you look at our business, we've got the large number of good performing products that continues to grow, both from product development within our Affiliates as well as this quarter is a great example, the addition of a whole bunch of fantastic new products that we can leverage. They have a great distribution, and they have great businesses with good growth factors -- we can leverage that through the global distribution platforms we're building, that incremental scale, and make it easier for them to attract appropriate clients for them.

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.61 for the fourth quarter, and $12.55 for the full year.

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.61 for the fourth quarter, and $12.55 for the full year. Notwithstanding declines in global equity indices, AMG generated strong results, including year-over-year earnings growth of 10% and excellent execution in our new investments area, with the addition of 6 outstanding new Affiliates which diversify and broaden our position in global equities and alternatives and enhance the earnings power of our overall business.
With record earnings in 2015, AMG enters 2016 in a very strong position. Our outstanding Affiliates are continuing to build on their excellent long-term performance track records, especially in alternatives and global equities. And through the addition of new Affiliates and the growth of our extant Affiliates, our business is now larger and more diverse across Affiliates, product areas and client geographies, than ever before.
Obviously, the volatile market environment presents challenges for all asset management firms. But while none of us can predict future market movements, it is clear that the market dislocation and rising dispersion provide the best managers of alpha-oriented products with an opportunity to excel, and this is reflected in our Affiliate's excellent performance results in alternative and active equity products in the last quarter and this quarter-to-date.
In addition, against the backdrop of uneven markets and lower returns, there is increasing client demand for high conviction actively managed products. We are seeing strong demand for our Affiliates' alternative strategies, and as global institutional clients increasingly allocate toward active products more generally, AMG is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
Although our net flows from the fourth quarter were impacted by several idiosyncratic factors, which as Nate will describe, we don't expect to reoccur. Looking ahead, and in the current quarter, we are seeing strong momentum among institutional clients and much improved retail flows.  Going forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong earnings growth, consistent with our track record of growing earnings well in excess of market indices and industry averages over the short, medium and long term.
The drivers of our earnings growth include organic growth, especially in the higher fee alpha-oriented products, and the accretion from new investments where we have an unmatched competitive position as well as tremendous ongoing opportunities. 
In addition, our increasingly broad and diverse exposure to performance fee products gives us an asymmetric opportunity for earnings upside. While the substantial majority of our earnings from alternative products are in the form of management fees, often in long-term locked funds, we have a large, diverse and relatively uncorrelated array of performance fee products in liquid and illiquid strategies, spanning private equity, infrastructure, energy, credit, control equity, global macro, multi-strategy, relative value, managed futures and long/short equities.  And as we've added new Affiliates like Systematica, Ivory, and Baring Asia, and existing Affiliates like AQR, BlueMountain, and ValueAct have increased their asset bases, their prospective earnings contribution from performance fees has become both larger and even more consistent.
Turning now to new investments. We were very pleased with the excellent execution of our strategy in 2015 with 5 new Affiliates added during the year, and the momentum has continued into 2016 as we announced our first investment of the year with the addition of Baring Asia a few weeks ago. Baring Asia is the largest dedicated Asian private equity firm with an exceptional 18-year track record of alpha generation and outstanding forward prospects.
The quality of our new Affiliates reflects the strength of our competitive advantage and partnering with the very best boutique firms globally. We are better positioned than ever to capitalize on our substantial forward opportunity set which is increasingly global, as demonstrated by the fact that our 4 most recent new Affiliates are based on 4 different continents.
Prospective Affiliates around the world are drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner over the past few decades as well as the proven success of our global distribution platform. And the virtuous circle of our new investment strategy and global distribution capabilities continues to build on itself.  This virtuous circle is reinforced by the addition of differentiated, or in some cases, entirely new product areas to AMG's overall offering. 
AMG has the unique ability to add best-in-class, immediately salable products with long-term investment track records, and bring them to new client audiences around the world. Having recently brought on board new Affiliates with outstanding product sets that diversify and extend our aggregate offering, including in areas such as managed futures, global equities, long/short equities, Asian private equity and Asian real estate, all areas where we see significant demand both now and over the long term, our client dialogues become richer and the overall franchise more valuable.
Looking back on 2015, we made substantial progress in building our business, and generated earnings growth which was strong on both in absolute and relative basis. While volatile markets create inevitable challenges, they also create opportunities. And over the past 2 decades, we have consistently demonstrated an ability to effectively manage through difficult environments and emerge with an even stronger franchise and competitive position.
With that, I'll turn it Nate to discuss our Affiliates in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a volatile market environment marked by rising dispersion across and within asset classes, our Affiliates and especially, our largest Affiliates, performed well, relative to their benchmarks and peers.But",1607,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a volatile market environment marked by rising dispersion across and within asset classes, our Affiliates and especially, our largest Affiliates, performed well, relative to their benchmarks and peers.
But before I cover our Affiliate performance in detail, I want to take a moment to describe the factors behind our net outflows in the fourth quarter and in particular, give us an insight into the positive flow momentum we're seeing now. First, in the fourth quarter, in the institutional channel, while we had significant quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement in net flows, we had large idiosyncratic outflows from several institutional clients that were unrelated to performance, meaning that we're confident that the Affiliate performance was not the cause of the redemption. 
Let me step back and put some of this into perspective. There was a recent industry research report that estimated the average, so called, petro-dollar related client AUM to be 4.1% of total AUM for a number of public asset managers. Our entire remaining exposure to this category across our Affiliates is actually much lower at only half the average or roughly 2%. Performance is generally quite good, and in fact, some of these assets are in locked-up vehicles, so we believe our prospective for volatility from these clients will be significantly less than the industry average.
Now moving from the institutional channel, all of my other high-level comments on flows relates to the Mutual Fund channel, or against the broad backdrop of industry-wide continued outflows from U.S. equities, but we have a trail exposure to the mutual funds channel. Now against that backdrop, there were several significant one-off items in the quarter. 
First, like many of our U.S. fund industry peers, we had a material amount of year-end tax distributions. Our estimate is roughly $800 million of tax distribution, net of the main vested amount. Now while this is seasonal, this year was notable after 6 consecutive years of strong equity market returns. However, even more significant last quarter were the idiosyncratic outflows related to the liquidation of the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund. To be clear, in the fourth quarter, we're recognizing 100% of the focused credit funds remaining assets as outflows. In addition to this fund's impact on the net flows in the quarter, all of the other funds with Third Avenue saw elevated outflows after the announcement of the liquidation of Focused Credit as well. These total together almost $2.2 billion in the quarter.
Finally, we also have the termination of a large non-U.S. sub-advisory relationship across multiple products driven by internal client needs. Now looking ahead, while we do see active U.S. equity outflows continuing for the industry and AMG, the idiosyncratic items should be behind us, except for possibly some ongoing but reduced outflows at Third Avenue. In fact, if you look across publicly available data, inflows for our U.S. mutual fund business are a positive $830 million for the month of January. And that's coming especially from continued strength in our alternatives and global equity funds, combined with reduced outflows as these isolated issues from the fourth quarter to get behind us, from the trajectory of our U.S. equities books and proofs. 
Looking ahead, and setting aside the idiosyncratic factors that impacted last quarter, with positive mutual fund flows in January we're confident that our retail flows will be substantially better, and we see ongoing good momentum in our institutional business, giving us strength of our Affiliates performance, combined with the additional several high quality new Affiliates with in-demand products sets.
Now turning to investment performance for the fourth quarter, and starting with the alternatives offerings. Our Affiliates in alternatives category feature excellent long-term performance track records across a wide range of liquid and illiquid alternative strategies. As Sean noted, we've an increasingly broad and large-scale diverse set of alternative products, and in the quarter we added industry-leading Affiliates such as Systematica and Baring Asia, and the size of the alternative book at some of our largest Affiliates continues to scale. And Affiliates such as AQR, BlueMountain and [indiscernible]. 
In terms of performance, and starting on the more liquid side. In the quarter a number of strategies in AQR delivered strong, absolute and relative performance, notably Style Premia, Delta, hedge fund beta products, long-short equity and equity market neutral. And these strategies all have vehicles tracked by MorningStar, and each are in top decile or even top percentile rankings in their respective Morning Star categories both the quarter and full year 2015.
On the illiquid side, returning from -- the returns from Pantheon infrastructure offerings and call investments remains quite strong. And they continued to diversify the product set. For example, broadening from their successful infrastructure team into real assets capabilities in 2015. On the other hand, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they outperformed a number of their high-quality peers.
Next, moving to the global developed markets category. Harding Loevner continues to deliver good returns in both the quarter and the year across our international and global equities strategies, as they added to their strong long-term records. AQR also extended their long-term track records with good performance in the quarter and year, while Artemis also had excellent returns for the year, although fourth quarter performance was mixed. While Tweedy, Browne underperformed their benchmarks in the fourth quarter, they have performed very well versus peers and benchmarks through the market volatility in the current quarter, and now feature top quartile returns for the 1 year and top decile returns over 3 year and longer time periods.  In addition, Tweedy, Browne announced the reopening of their Global Value Fund 2 on February 1 after having been closed for the past 2 years and they are beginning to see opportunities to put additional capital to work.
In the emerging market category. For the broad industry, the fourth quarter was a muted-finish to a volatile year. Our Affiliates however generated strong relative returns. Harding Loevner posted good returns in both the quarter and year, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good relative returns, in both their emerging markets wealth and emerging market strategies, while Genesis was in line with the MSCI Em Index for the year, posting excellent relative returns over the longer term.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities. Performance across our Affiliates was mixed in the quarter, but each of Chicago equity frontier, GW&K, River Road and TimesSquare, continued or extended their good, longer-term performance track records. 
In the U.S. equity category, I also wanted to highlight Yacktman. They underperformed in the quarter and for the full year 2015. However, they have posted excellent relative returns in the market volatility to this quarter so far. Featuring the top 2% or 3% year-to-date, and remaining with first or second percentile performance in the 10 or 15-year time period still. They also have recently reopened their products. And we believe, the recent dispersion and volatility is providing them with an opportunity to put some of their high-level new cash to work.
In fact, I'd like to also make a couple of broader comments about performance given the significant volatility we've seen at the start of the year. In general, a number of our largest Affiliates and their most significant products are meaningfully value-oriented, including AQR; Pantheon; Tweedy, Browne; Yacktman and including our quality growth managers, like Harding Loevner. These firms and their products are performing very well on a relative basis in this environment. And this should position them extremely well to further extend their excellent long-term track records, while the volatility and dispersion create significant opportunities for them to put client items to work.
Now turning to more detailed look at flows for the quarter and by channel. As we always say, flows in both the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy, and we certainly saw that this quarter. So in the institutional channel, we had significant sequential improvement in flows, with total net inflows of $253 million in the quarter. The themes in the quarter include the idiosyncratic outflows I mentioned earlier, but also very strong inflows in the quarter from alternative products, both in liquid and illiquid, and fund in separate account forms. 
Now in the Mutual Fund channel, the outflows are $7.2 billion. As we mentioned earlier, this was driven by continued U.S. equity outflows consistent with the broader industry, as well as the seasonal net tax distribution and the Third Avenue flows we recognized in the quarter. To repeat, we're taking 100% of the focused-credit fund assets as outflows in the quarter. Finally, consistent with my earlier comments, we also had several lumpy sub advisory outflows in U.S. and global equities.
In our high net-worth channel, we had net inflows of $92 million in the quarter. Inflows to our wealth partners Affiliates, as well as alternatives and municipal bond strategies, were partly offset by outflows from our U.S. equity and regional products, including broker sold channels. 
Now maybe 1 final point about flows and distribution. As Sean noted, the current volatility combined with an ongoing low return environment are increasing investors focus on active management, and especially, diversifying sources of return. Our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide array of strategies, and the current environment is providing increasing opportunities to show the value of active management.  This excellent short and long-term performance reinforces our confidence in the significant positive flow generation opportunity coming from both our Affiliates own selling efforts, as well as our complementary global distribution teams. 
With that, I'll turn it to Jay."

As Sean mentioned, our 2015 results demonstrate our ability to generate strong earnings even in periods of volatility and challenging market conditions.  The combination of our broad diversification return-oriented assets across Affiliate",693,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean mentioned, our 2015 results demonstrate our ability to generate strong earnings even in periods of volatility and challenging market conditions.  The combination of our broad diversification return-oriented assets across Affiliates, client channels and geographies, and our investment structure which limits our exposure to the operating leverage at our Affiliates, provides a level of stability in our cash flows, allowing us to execute on our growth strategy throughout the market cycle. 
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $12.55 for 2015, an increase of 10% over 2014. For the fourth quarter, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.61, which included net performance fees of $0.75.  On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.72. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. We reported EBITDA of $942.2 million for 2015. For the fourth quarter, our EBITDA was $263.1 million, and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 17.2 basis points, or approximately 13.2 basis points excluding performance fees.  In the first quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.6 basis points which includes the full run rate impact of our new investments.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%, reflecting the benefit of a change in the U.K. tax rate. And our cash tax rate was approximately 22%. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the fourth quarter were $15.5 million, which was lower than expected as a result of the U.K. tax rate change, and we expect this number to return to approximately $22 million per quarter in 2016.
Our share of reported amortization for the fourth quarter was $28.6 million, which includes $8.1 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the first quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to $34 million due to the addition of new investments.
Our share of interest expense with fourth quarter was $20.6 million. And in the first quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to increase to $22 million due to higher revolver balances from the financing of our new investments. Our other economic items for the fourth quarter were $2.5 million, and as we look forward for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. With our substantial liquidity capacity, we successfully executed on our new investment strategy and closed 3 new investments in the fourth quarter, and 2 new Affiliates, Systematica and Bearing, in January. In addition, we repurchased 34 million in shares in the quarter, bringing our total to approximately $366 million for the year. 
With strong, recurring free cash flow generated from the scale and diversity of our business, combined with prudent leverage and low cost of capital, we are well-positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Now turning to guidance. We are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.40 to $14. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter, and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter of 2016. We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance, and a mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings.  Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earning contributions of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we will be happy to answer your questions."

We had 21 straight quarters of positive flows, industry-leading -- in many cases on an absolute basis but if you think that -- think about it, that from the standpoint of the product composition, for us, the flows are pretty much all active equities and alternatives. And the rest of the industry, as you know, is almost all passive and fixed income. And so that engine of organic growth continues. And as Nate described, we see ongoing momentum and based on the -- to some extent, early anecdotal data and commentary that we see from talking to clients and clients describing their own strategic positioning, we think that, as we said earlier, it's even more going to be a period of favoring active equity and alternatives going forward, obviously -- the ones that generate alpha and the ones that have a track record of being able to sell their products effectively on a global basis. And that's all that we've been doing. I think we had a period -- we got 2 quarters with idiosyncratic events, one around large clients who are redeeming for nonperformance-related reasons. And I think Nate described the extent to which our ongoing exposure is much more limited than our peers. And given the remaining products, we feel as good as we can feel, include some of the products, we've seen long-term locked vehicles, we feel as good as we can feel about the exposure there. We had a tough period in retail, especially U.S. retail, and I think that's largely passed us in their early trends, certainly from performance standpoint, as well as from a flow standpoint through the first month. Well I think we've had a good month and I'm not -- I think that's good on an absolute basis, but also very good on a relative basis. And then of course, we had another one-off event around Third Avenue and the closing of that fund. And there, the flows have moderated, as Nate described. And so looking forward, we are very optimistic about a resumption of the kind of momentum that we'd shown and demonstrated over the past 5 years and nothing that we see -- nothing that we can see is at all at odds with that."

Our spot rate at the moment is about $54.4 million So obviously, to get to a weighted average of $54 million, we're going to go below that through the end of the year. And again, it's just a model convention. The actual share repurchases will be based on what we see in both new investments and capital management as it relates to share repurchase, so it can be more or less than that, but again, just model convention. I'm putting in perspective that weighted average share count for this year, 2015 was $55.1 million, and last year was $56.3 million. So we're taking off $1 million to -- $1.25 million over the last 2 years. So as Sean said, we have the track record of doing both, and we've -- and during this period, had substantial new investments as well."

So sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Let me, maybe, I'll just start with guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what with the update in the guidance 2",808,"Yes. So sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Let me, maybe, I'll just start with guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what with the update in the guidance 2016 range of $12.40 to $14 -- it was based on the mark-to-market of our AUMs since our last call. It will -- it's included the inclusion of Baring Asia which was the new transaction. Because on November 9, when we last gave guidance, we had already announced the other 3, so we included Baring Asia and its accretion in the full -- for the full year effect from 2016. We also updated our performance fee assumption for the year given the addition of Systematica and Baring Asia and Ivory, all of which have performance fees. So those 3 things were the main items that we updated and reflected on. Starting with the building block on market data, since we gave the guidance on November 9 through the end of the year, well, starting with -- as of November 9, we were up about 4% in the quarter. And as you can see from our AUM table, we finished up about 2%. So the delta between November 9 and the end of the year was minus 2%. Then, quarter-to-date through February 1, so since the end of the year to now, we experienced another 4% down, in line with broader markets. So if you add a negative 2% and 4%, you get a minus 6%. And then lastly, reminding you of our modeling convention. We assume no more market data in this current quarter. So we removed our model convention of 2% for this quarter. So the change, the full change was down 8%, and part of that was model convention. But thereafter, we grow it 2%. So it's the second, third and fourth quarter at 2%. So that's the underlying assumption for beta for the rest of the year. And then when you think about Baring, because it closed on January 4, we really get the full year effect of Baring in our earnings accretion that does partially offset that market change that I just mentioned. And then on performance fees, so let me address that, with the growth in our existing alternative products, more broadly, combined with the addition of the new products from Systematica, Baring Asia and Ivory, these products have low or no correlation to our existing product sets. We expect our performance fee opportunity to grow modestly as a percentage of our earnings base. And as Sean has said, we are confident in the consistency of this earnings stream given the diversity and the correlation of the performance fee generating products. So as a result, at a midpoint of our range, we see the level of performance fees, is at approximately 10% of our earnings. And as we've always said in the past, we feel great about the base level of performance fees in a year, the breadth and the diversity of the performance fee product set creates this positive asymmetry that Sean mentioned, increasing the probability of achieving the low end of the guidance range. And at the high end it reflects a greater expected value that we could experience given the scale on diversity. And then finally, just reminding you that relative to, say, some of the publicly traded alternative firms, we take a different approach to performance fee accounting. We only recognize them in earnings when we realize them in cash in the period in which we experience them. So now getting to your question of funding, so we closed 2 after the end of the quarter, and our balance on the revolver was just 2 -- just under $300 million. I think I'd mentioned, we thought it was going to be closer to being $500 million, but Systematic closed right after the end of the quarter, and then of course, Baring came on after that. So in the first quarter, the revolver balance will be half -- roughly half of our full revolver of $1.3 billion, so call it $650 million to $700 million is where we would expect revolver balance to be as we get through this quarter, more broadly, as it relates to funding, we, of course, have episodic new investments. And so as new investments occur episodically, we may increase our leverage modestly for short periods, but given our strong free recurring cash flow, we're able to reduce that leverage very quickly, in really, 1 quarter or 2. So as a result, we really have the flexibility to continue to do deals throughout this whole year. And our long term sort of target leverage is at 2 or less and we'll maintain that as we go through the year."

I think the answer is broadly, value will do better from a flow standpoint as it does better from a performance perspective, stating the completely obvious. And we're seeing early signs of that, but it's too soon to tell. I think there are crosscurrents in the industry around passive versus active and those will, to some extent, continue. But I think it is highly likely given the volatility and dispersion that this will be a period where -- and I think, perhaps, for a while, we're active -- the best active, strongly outperforms passive. And I think you've heard -- I've heard some of my peers in the industry say the same thing, including firms where they have significant passive exposure. And so we're believing that, and it is -- it follows logically from the environment and from the track record of firms. And our exposure has been -- is very heavily focused on alpha-generating products the alpha side of the barbell, high conviction, active equity managers and alternative managers, and a broad diverse array of alternative. And so we are ideally positioned for an environment like this, having had 5 years of industry-leading organic growth and flows in a period which was much more challenging for these kinds of products. The other thing that we have, as you know, is a -- it's not deliberate, but we have a significant tilt towards the value among a number of our Affiliates.

And so -- and I also think this extends not just to value managers and it is also, as we said within our prepared remarks, sort of quality growth managers as well. So I think in the -- restating the obvious, right, I think as we enter a period within there's -- some of the best managers are now starting to say they can find value again, although not all of them, right? But some of them are starting to say they can find value again, I called out in my prepared remarks Tweedy, Browne for example, that the products have been close for over 2 years, not because people didn't want to give money. Their cash balances they're growing and they needed to be able to put the money to work for existing clients first. And they'd now decided to reopen their -- one of their global funds, and they're finding things to invest in. And that will take the cycle which is -- as they find things to invest in, and as performance goes well and they're open to new money, they'll be gathering flows. And I do think that cycle, that growth value cycle -- there will be a cycle to it, and flows will definitely follow."

Maybe Nate would have it. But there's a clear trend toward the outflows moderating. As clients focus again on the outstanding long-term record of Third Avenue's products, especially their flagship real estate product, which obviously is completely unrelated to and away from the focus credit product, so the management team has more than a decade, on average of experience. And we feel terrific about the firm's prospects and their financial and operating position. They're extremely well reserved. And so I think it is probable that there is some further redemption and shrinkage through the -- through this period. But I see over time, a little bit, as market trends sort of favor them, as we were just discussing around the opportunities for deep value managers, but of course they're going to have to generate excellent performance as they have in the past. And as they do that, we see them bottoming and then recovering. And as I said, have every confidence in their ability to do that. But stepping back and may be reframing a little bit, just to put this in context for AMG, Third Avenue is, from a run rate earnings contribution standpoint, 1% of our earnings. So really, no impact to AMG's financials from their results. And you didn't ask this, but to the extent anybody has a question, we don't think that Third Avenue has any legal exposure around the focus credit fund closure, et cetera, but we are completely comfortable that AMG has no legal exposure at all given our structure and approach. And so going forward, while it is, it's been a difficult period for Third Avenue, and obviously, attracted a lot of publicity and perhaps, a lot of uncertainty around any potential exposure to AMG. I -- hopefully, these comments make that crystal clear."

I think we also need to think about the fact that there are things that are not necessarily sort of legally locked structures, but for all intents and purposes, they're sort of very, very stable asset basis, separate account, sort of GP funded one kind of structure. And that's a significant portion of our alternatives book. On -- when you talk about the fund raising pipeline, it's a source of particular strength for us, right? So right now, we're having good traction or exceptional traction on the liquids side, unique funds like AQR in our existing Affiliate group, they've done a fantastic job. And if you look at new Affiliates from [indiscernible] and the opportunities there, that's very strong with macro results. So the opportunity set there is really extraordinary. And then on the illiquid side, I'd sort of call out firms like Pantheon, where they've got good -- they have had a really good year. The forward opportunity set looks very, very good, both in the sort of the traditional private equity primaries and secondaries, but also, they have really broadened out their capabilities in infrastructure. And now I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks in real assets. And those are really high demand product areas, the track record, early track record is very, very good, and they think they can put a lot of assets to work. And also, I think you'll see, continued product development, frankly, in both sides, liquid and illiquid. And as we've talked about in prior calls, I think we are very well positioned to help these firms as they bring new products to market because of the sort of the quality of engagement we have with the marketplace, both on the institutional side, right? And that we have these good dialogues worldwide, but also, in the packaging, in bringing product to the retail marketplace. And again, the example I'll highlight here, last year was bringing the Pantheon private equity capability set to the DC marketplace, both in CIT and mutual fund form. And sort of first clients demanded there -- first DC clients demanded there. And I think that's the kind of business where both -- we can add a lot of value, and we're going to see real good growth.

So which is a very institutional sell, where we're leveraging, they're already very strong distribution capabilities, but we are adding geographical to it.  Contrast that with a firm like the SouthernSun or River Road. SouthernSun, very quickly, integrated them into our retail distribution. But again, when we experienced there, it's very hard -- there's no sort of here it's the base case. But they are fully integrated into our retail distribution and working day 1 with a firm like River Road, where we actually knew on the distribution side already. And so we're working with and have done something from the product development and also extending their product distribution into the wires [indiscernible] where they or we're not working with them instead of [indiscernible] . So even the short answer is we're making really good progress of all those firms integrating them in. I do think, even -- 2014 is not that long ago, and so the trajectory impact, I think is probably more impacted by the macro things than what's going on within the product sets, what's going on with the various distribution channel.

If you look in the last 4 to 5 years and look at client trends on a retail basis, but also institutional, which is of course, more of the focus of our overall business, it's been a period which has favored passive products. So retail investors increasingly moving from active to passive equity exposure, but also, at the similar trend in a different way. And obviously, it expresses itself quite differently from one institutional client to another. But I would say there has been broadly, a similar kind of trend among institutions. And through that whole period, we've had extremely strong flows on the back of excellent performance by our alpha-oriented Affiliates as well as excellent results in our alternative products, which are sort of away from the question that I think you're posing. Looking forward, I think that the trends are much more likely to favor active managers, high conviction, high-performing alpha-oriented managers, for sure. And therefore, I think there's every reason for us to feel confident. We do feel confident that going forward, our active equity Affiliates are continuing to -- are going to continue to do well and indeed maybe even see accelerating flows. And meanwhile, our significant exposure to a very broad diverse set of alternative products, which have been and continue to be highly favored by institutional clients gives us another source of confidence.

And fulfill the alpha proportions of performance. We think that those trends remain intact and then if you look at our business, we've got the large number of good performing products that continues to grow, both from product development within our Affiliates as well as this quarter is a great example, the addition of a whole bunch of fantastic new products that we can leverage. They have a great distribution, and they have great businesses with good growth projections -- we can leverage that through the global distribution platforms we're building, that incremental scale, and make it easier for them to attract appropriate clients for them.

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.61 for the fourth quarter, and $12.55 for the full year. Notwithstanding declines in global equity indices, AMG generated strong results, including year-over-year earnings growth of 10% and excellent execution in our new investments area, with the addition of 6 outstanding new Affiliates which diversify and broaden our position in global equities and alternatives and enhance the earnings power of our overall business.
With record earnings in 2015, AMG enters 2016 in a very strong position. Our outstanding Affiliates are continuing to build on their excellent long-term performance track records, especially in alternatives and global equities. And through the addition of new Affiliates and the growth of our extant Affiliates, our business is now larger and more diverse across Affiliates, product areas and client geographies, than ever before.
Obviously, the volatile market environment presents challenges for all asset management firms. But while none of us can predict future market movements, it is clear that the market dislocation and rising dispersion provide the best managers of alpha-oriented products with an opportunity to excel, and this is reflected in our Affiliate's excellent performance results in alternative and active equity products in the last quarter and this quarter-to-date.
In addition, against the backdrop of uneven markets and lower returns, there is increasing client demand for high conviction actively managed products. We are seeing strong demand for our Affiliates' alternative strategies, and as global institutional clients increasingly allocate toward active products more generally, AMG is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
Although our net flows from the fourth quarter were impacted by several idiosyncratic factors, which as Nate will describe, we don't expect to reoccur. Looking ahead, and in the current quarter, we are seeing strong momentum among institutional clients and much improved retail flows. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong earnings growth, consistent with our track record of growing earnings well in excess of market indices and industry averages over the short, medium and long term.
The drivers of our earnings growth include organic growth, especially in the higher fee alpha-oriented products, and the accretion from new investments where we have an unmatched competitive position as well as tremendous ongoing opportunities. 
In addition, our increasingly broad and diverse exposure to performance fee products gives us an asymmetric opportunity for earnings upside. While the substantial majority of our earnings from alternative products are in the form of management fees, often in long-term locked funds, we have a large, diverse and relatively uncorrelated array of performance fee products in liquid and illiquid strategies, spanning private equity, infrastructure, energy, credit, control equity, global macro, multi-strategy, relative value, managed futures and long/short equities. And as we've added new Affiliates like Systematica, Ivory, and Baring Asia, and existing Affiliates like AQR, BlueMountain, and ValueAct have increased their asset bases, their prospective earnings contribution from performance fees has become both larger and even more consistent.
Turning now to new investments. We were very pleased with the excellent execution of our strategy in 2015 with 5 new Affiliates added during the year, and the momentum has continued into 2016 as we announced our first investment of the year with the addition of Baring Asia a few weeks ago. Baring Asia is the largest dedicated Asian private equity firm with an exceptional 18-year track record of alpha generation and outstanding forward prospects.
The quality of our new Affiliates reflects the strength of our competitive advantage and partnering with the very best boutique firms globally. We are better positioned than ever to capitalize on our substantial forward opportunity set which is increasingly global, as demonstrated by the fact that our 4 most recent new Affiliates are based on 4 different continents.
Prospective Affiliates around the world are drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner over the past few decades as well as the proven success of our global distribution platform. And the virtuous circle of our new investment strategy and global distribution capabilities continues to build on itself. This virtuous circle is reinforced by the addition of differentiated, or in some cases, entirely new product areas to AMG's overall offering. 
AMG has the unique ability to add best-in-class, immediately salable products with long-term investment track records, and bring them to new client audiences around the world. Having recently brought on board new Affiliates with outstanding product sets that diversify and extend our aggregate offering, including in areas such as managed futures, global equities, long/short equities, Asian private equity and Asian real estate, all areas where we see significant demand both now and over the long term, our client dialogues become richer and the overall franchise more valuable.
Looking back on 2015, we made substantial progress in building our business, and generated earnings growth which was strong on both in absolute and relative basis. While volatile markets create inevitable challenges, they also create opportunities. And over the past 2 decades, we have consistently demonstrated an ability to effectively manage through difficult environments and emerge with an even stronger franchise and competitive position.
With that, I'll turn it Nate to discuss our Affiliates in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a volatile market environment marked by rising dispersion across and within asset classes, our Affiliates and especially, our largest Affiliates, performed well, relative to their benchmarks and peers.
But before I cover our Affiliate performance in detail, I want to take a moment to describe the factors behind our net outflows in the fourth quarter and in particular, give us an insight into the positive flow momentum we're seeing now. First, in the fourth quarter, in the institutional channel, while we had significant quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement in net flows, we had large idiosyncratic outflows from several institutional clients that were unrelated to performance, meaning that we're confident that the Affiliate performance was not the cause of the redemption. 
Let me step back and put some of this into perspective. There was a recent industry research report that estimated the average, so called, petro-dollar related client AUM to be 4.1% of total AUM for a number of public asset managers. Our entire remaining exposure to this category across our Affiliates is actually much lower at only half the average or roughly 2%. Performance is generally quite good, and in fact, some of these assets are in locked-up vehicles, so we believe our prospective for volatility from these clients will be significantly less than the industry average.
Now moving from the institutional channel, all of my other high-level comments on flows relates to the Mutual Fund channel, or against the broad backdrop of industry-wide continued outflows from U.S. equities, but we have a trail exposure to the mutual funds channel. Now against that backdrop, there were several significant one-off items in the quarter. 
First, like many of our U.S. fund industry peers, we had a material amount of year-end tax distributions. Our estimate is roughly $800 million of tax distribution, net of the main vested amount. Now while this is seasonal, this year was notable after 6 consecutive years of strong equity market returns. However, even more significant last quarter were the idiosyncratic outflows related to the liquidation of the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund. To be clear, in the fourth quarter, we're recognizing 100% of the focused credit funds remaining assets as outflows. In addition to this fund's impact on the net flows in the quarter, all of the other funds with Third Avenue saw elevated outflows after the announcement of the liquidation of Focused Credit as well. These total together almost $2.2 billion in the quarter.
Finally, we also have the termination of a large non-U.S. sub-advisory relationship across multiple products driven by internal client needs. Now looking ahead, while we do see active U.S. equity outflows continuing for the industry and AMG, the idiosyncratic items should be behind us, except for possibly some ongoing but reduced outflows at Third Avenue. In fact, if you look across publicly available data, inflows for our U.S. mutual fund business are a positive $830 million for the month of January. And that's coming especially from continued strength in our alternatives and global equity funds, combined with reduced outflows as these isolated issues from the fourth quarter to get behind us, from the trajectory of our U.S. equities books and proofs. 
Looking ahead, and setting aside the idiosyncratic factors that impacted last quarter, with positive mutual fund flows in January we're confident that our retail flows will be substantially better, and we see ongoing good momentum in our institutional business, giving us strength of our Affiliates performance, combined with the additional several high quality new Affiliates with in-demand products sets.
Now turning to investment performance for the fourth quarter, and starting with the alternatives offerings. Our Affiliates in alternatives category feature excellent long-term performance track records across a wide range of liquid and illiquid alternative strategies. As Sean noted, we've an increasingly broad and large-scale diverse set of alternative products, and in the quarter we added industry-leading Affiliates such as Systematica and Baring Asia, and the size of the alternative book at some of our largest Affiliates continues to scale. And Affiliates such as AQR, BlueMountain and [indiscernible]. 
In terms of performance, and starting on the more liquid side. In the quarter a number of strategies in AQR delivered strong, absolute and relative performance, notably Style Premia, Delta, hedge fund beta products, long-short equity and equity market neutral. And these strategies all have vehicles tracked by MorningStar, and each are in top decile or even top percentile rankings in their respective Morning Star categories both the quarter and full year 2015.
On the illiquid side, returning from -- the returns from Pantheon infrastructure offerings and call investments remains quite strong. And they continued to diversify the product set. For example, broadening from their successful infrastructure team into real assets capabilities in 2015. On the other hand, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they outperformed a number of their high-quality peers.
Next, moving to the global developed markets category. Harding Loevner continues to deliver good returns in both the quarter and the year across our international and global equities strategies, as they added to their strong long-term records. AQR also extended their long-term track records with good performance in the quarter and year, while Artemis also had excellent returns for the year, although fourth quarter performance was mixed. While Tweedy, Browne underperformed their benchmarks in the fourth quarter, they have performed very well versus peers and benchmarks through the market volatility in the current quarter, and now feature top quartile returns for the 1 year and top decile returns over 3 year and longer time periods. In addition, Tweedy, Browne announced the reopening of their Global Value Fund 2 on February 1 after having been closed for the past 2 years and they are beginning to see opportunities to put additional capital to work.
In the emerging market category. For the broad industry, the fourth quarter was a muted-finish to a volatile year. Our Affiliates however generated strong relative returns. Harding Loevner posted good returns in both the quarter and year, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good relative returns, in both their emerging markets wealth and emerging market strategies, while Genesis was in line with the MSCI Em Index for the year, posting excellent relative returns over the longer term.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities. Performance across our Affiliates was mixed in the quarter, but each of Chicago equity frontier, GW&K, River Road and TimesSquare, continued or extended their good, longer-term performance track records. 
In the U.S. equity category, I also wanted to highlight Yacktman. They underperformed in the quarter and for the full year 2015. However, they have posted excellent relative returns in the market volatility to this quarter so far. Featuring the top 2% or 3% year-to-date, and remaining with first or second percentile performance in the 10 or 15-year time period still. They also have recently reopened their products. And we believe, the recent dispersion and volatility is providing them with an opportunity to put some of their high-level new cash to work.
In fact, I'd like to also make a couple of broader comments about performance given the significant volatility we've seen at the start of the year. In general, a number of our largest Affiliates and their most significant products are meaningfully value-oriented, including AQR; Pantheon; Tweedy, Browne; Yacktman and including our quality growth managers, like Harding Loevner. These firms and their products are performing very well on a relative basis in this environment. And this should position them extremely well to further extend their excellent long-term track records, while the volatility and dispersion create significant opportunities for them to put client items to work.
Now turning to more detailed look at flows for the quarter and by channel. As we always say, flows in both the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy, and we certainly saw that this quarter. So in the institutional channel, we had significant sequential improvement in flows, with total net inflows of $253 million in the quarter. The themes in the quarter include the idiosyncratic outflows I mentioned earlier, but also very strong inflows in the quarter from alternative products, both in liquid and illiquid, and fund in separate account forms. 
Now in the Mutual Fund channel, the outflows are $7.2 billion. As we mentioned earlier, this was driven by continued U.S. equity outflows consistent with the broader industry as well as the seasonal net tax distribution and the Third Avenue flows we recognized in the quarter. To repeat, we're taking 100% of the focused-credit fund assets as outflows in the quarter. Finally, consistent with my earlier comments, we also had several lumpy sub advisory outflows in U.S. and global equities.
In our high net-worth channel, we had net inflows of $92 million in the quarter. Inflows to our wealth partners Affiliates as well as alternatives and municipal bond strategies, were partly offset by outflows from our U.S. equity and regional products, including broker sold channels. 
Now maybe 1 final point about flows and distribution. As Sean noted, the current volatility combined with an ongoing low return environment are increasing investors focus on active management, and especially, diversifying sources of return. Our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide array of strategies, and the current environment is providing increasing opportunities to show the value of active management. This excellent short and long-term performance reinforces our confidence in the significant positive flow generation opportunity coming from both our Affiliates own selling efforts as well as our complementary global distribution teams. 
With that, I'll turn it to Jay."

As Sean mentioned, our 2015 results demonstrate our ability to generate strong earnings even in periods of volatility and challenging market conditions.

As Sean mentioned, our 2015 results demonstrate our ability to generate strong earnings even in periods of volatility and challenging market conditions. The combination of our broad diversification return-oriented assets across Affiliates, client channels and geographies, and our investment structure which limits our exposure to the operating leverage at our Affiliates, provides a level of stability in our cash flows, allowing us to execute on our growth strategy throughout the market cycle. 
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $12.55 for 2015, an increase of 10% over 2014. For the fourth quarter, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.61, which included net performance fees of $0.75. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.72. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. We reported EBITDA of $942.2 million for 2015. For the fourth quarter, our EBITDA was $263.1 million, and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 17.2 basis points, or approximately 13.2 basis points excluding performance fees. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.6 basis points which includes the full run rate impact of our new investments.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%, reflecting the benefit of a change in the U.K. tax rate. And our cash tax rate was approximately 22%. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the fourth quarter were $15.5 million, which was lower than expected as a result of the U.K. tax rate change, and we expect this number to return to approximately $22 million per quarter in 2016.
Our share of reported amortization for the fourth quarter was $28.6 million, which includes $8.1 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the first quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to $34 million due to the addition of new investments.
Our share of interest expense with fourth quarter was $20.6 million. And in the first quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to increase to $22 million due to higher revolver balances from the financing of our new investments. Our other economic items for the fourth quarter were $2.5 million, and as we look forward for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. With our substantial liquidity capacity, we successfully executed on our new investment strategy and closed 3 new investments in the fourth quarter, and 2 new Affiliates, Systematica and Bearing, in January. In addition, we repurchased 34 million in shares in the quarter, bringing our total to approximately $366 million for the year. 
With strong, recurring free cash flow generated from the scale and diversity of our business, combined with prudent leverage and low cost of capital, we are well-positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.
Now turning to guidance. We are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.40 to $14. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter, and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter of 2016. We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance, and a mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earning contributions of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we will be happy to answer your questions."

We also recognize and certainly recognize now, the shareholder value that is created through repurchases. I would say going forward, it will continue to be an emphasis on both elements. But the mix will vary in the circumstance. And I think we -- anticipating what I'm sure, will be a question around deal activity. It gives -- the market volatility generally, has a dampening effect on deal activity. And so I think the mix in the more immediate term is likely to be favoring repurchase.

We had 21 straight quarters of positive flows, industry-leading -- in many cases on an absolute basis but if you think that -- think about it, that from the standpoint of the product composition, for us, the flows are pretty much all active equities and alternatives. And the rest of the industry, as you know, is almost all passive and fixed income. And so that engine of organic growth continues. And as Nate described, we see ongoing momentum and based on the -- to some extent, early anecdotal data and commentary that we see from talking to clients and clients describing their own strategic positioning, we think that, as we said earlier, it's even more going to be a period of favoring active equity and alternatives going forward, obviously -- the ones that generate alpha and the ones that have a track record of being able to sell their products effectively on a global basis. And that's all that we've been doing. I think we had a period -- we got 2 quarters with idiosyncratic events, one around large clients who are redeeming for nonperformance-related reasons. And I think Nate described the extent to which our ongoing exposure is much more limited than our peers. And given the remaining products, we feel as good as we can feel, include some of the products, we've seen long-term locked vehicles, we feel as good as we can feel about the exposure there. We had a tough period in retail, especially U.S. retail, and I think that's largely passed us in their early trends, certainly from performance standpoint as well as from a flow standpoint through the first month. Well I think we've had a good month and I'm not -- I think that's good on an absolute basis, but also very good on a relative basis. And then of course, we had another one-off event around Third Avenue and the closing of that fund. And there, the flows have moderated, as Nate described. And so looking forward, we are very optimistic about a resumption of the kind of momentum that we'd shown and demonstrated over the past 5 years and nothing that we see -- nothing that we can see is at all at odds with that."

It's probably not quite as weighted toward global and alternative as it was last year. But we had a terrific result last year and especially for the last quarter. And so while there's -- as we has said many times in the past, the deals tend to come in clumps and it's very difficult to forecast quarter-to-quarter. I would say that any pause -- that you might see would be around market volatility and just the accident of timing. On an overall basis, we couldn't be more positive about our prospects for continued accretion from new investments going forward.

The actual share repurchases will be based on what we see in both new investments and capital management as it relates to share repurchase, so it can be more or less than that, but again, just model convention. I'm putting in perspective that weighted average share count for this year, 2015 was $55.1 million, and last year was $56.3 million. So we're taking off $1 million to -- $1.25 million over the last 2 years.

So sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Let me, maybe, I'll just start with guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what with the update in the guidance 2",808,"Yes. So sure, Dan, I'll do the whole thing. Let me, maybe, I'll just start with guidance and then end up on capital levels on our revolver, just how we funded these transactions. I'll start with the guidance, just -- what with the update in the guidance 2016 range of $12.40 to $14 -- it was based on the mark-to-market of our AUMs since our last call. It will -- it's included the inclusion of Baring Asia which was the new transaction. Because on November 9, when we last gave guidance, we had already announced the other 3, so we included Baring Asia and its accretion in the full -- for the full year effect from 2016. We also updated our performance fee assumption for the year given the addition of Systematica and Baring Asia and Ivory, all of which have performance fees. So those 3 things were the main items that we updated and reflected on. Starting with the building block on market data, since we gave the guidance on November 9 through the end of the year, well, starting with -- as of November 9, we were up about 4% in the quarter. And as you can see from our AUM table, we finished up about 2%. So the delta between November 9 and the end of the year was minus 2%. Then, quarter-to-date through February 1, so since the end of the year to now, we experienced another 4% down, in line with broader markets. So if you add a negative 2% and 4%, you get a minus 6%. And then lastly, reminding you of our modeling convention. We assume no more market data in this current quarter. So we removed our model convention of 2% for this quarter. So the change, the full change was down 8%, and part of that was model convention. But thereafter, we grow it 2%. So it's the second, third and fourth quarter at 2%. So that's the underlying assumption for beta for the rest of the year. And then when you think about Baring, because it closed on January 4, we really get the full year effect of Baring in our earnings accretion that does partially offset that market change that I just mentioned. And then on performance fees, so let me address that, with the growth in our existing alternative products, more broadly, combined with the addition of the new products from Systematica, Baring Asia and Ivory, these products have low or no correlation to our existing product sets. We expect our performance fee opportunity to grow modestly as a percentage of our earnings base. And as Sean has said, we are confident in the consistency of this earnings stream given the diversity and the correlation of the performance fee generating products. So as a result, at a midpoint of our range, we see the level of performance fees, is at approximately 10% of our earnings. And as we've always said in the past, we feel great about the base level of performance fees in a year, the breadth and the diversity of the performance fee product set creates this positive asymmetry that Sean mentioned, increasing the probability of achieving the low end of the guidance range. And at the high end it reflects a greater expected value that we could experience given the scale on diversity. And then finally, just reminding you that relative to, say, some of the publicly traded alternative firms, we take a different approach to performance fee accounting. We only recognize them in earnings when we realize them in cash in the period in which we experience them. So now getting to your question of funding, so we closed 2 after the end of the quarter, and our balance on the revolver was just 2 -- just under $300 million. I think I'd mentioned, we thought it was going to be closer to being $500 million, but Systematic closed right after the end of the quarter, and then of course, Baring came on after that. So in the first quarter, the revolver balance will be half -- roughly half of our full revolver of $1.3 billion, so call it $650 million to $700 million is where we would expect revolver balance to be as we get through this quarter, more broadly, as it relates to funding, we, of course, have episodic new investments. And so as new investments occur episodically, we may increase our leverage modestly for short periods, but given our strong free recurring cash flow, we're able to reduce that leverage very quickly, in really, 1 quarter or 2. So as a result, we really have the flexibility to continue to do deals throughout this whole year. And our long term sort of target leverage is at 2 or less and we'll maintain that as we go through the year."

I think the answer is broadly, value will do better from a flow standpoint as it does better from a performance perspective, stating the completely obvious. And we're seeing early signs of that, but it's too soon to tell. I think there are crosscurrents in the industry around passive versus active and those will, to some extent, continue. But I think it is highly likely given the volatility and dispersion that this will be a period where -- and I think, perhaps, for a while, we're active -- the best active, strongly outperforms passive. And I think you've heard -- I've heard some of my peers in the industry say the same thing, including firms where they have significant passive exposure. And so we're believing that, and it is -- it follows logically from the environment and from the track record of firms. And our exposure has been -- is very heavily focused on alpha-generating products the alpha side of the barbell, high conviction, active equity managers and alternative managers, and a broad diverse array of alternative. And so we are ideally positioned for an environment like this, having had 5 years of industry-leading organic growth and flows in a period which was much more challenging for these kinds of products. The other thing that we have, as you know, is a -- it's not deliberate, but we have a significant tilt towards the value among a number of our Affiliates.

So I think in the -- restating the obvious, right, I think as we enter a period within there's -- some of the best managers are now starting to say they can find value again, although not all of them, right? But some of them are starting to say they can find value again, I called out in my prepared remarks Tweedy, Browne for example, that the products have been close for over 2 years, not because people didn't want to give money. Their cash balances they're growing and they needed to be able to put the money to work for existing clients first. And they'd now decided to reopen their -- one of their global funds, and they're finding things to invest in. And that will take the cycle which is -- as they find things to invest in, and as performance goes well and they're open to new money, they'll be gathering flows. And I do think that cycle, that growth value cycle -- there will be a cycle to it, and flows will definitely follow."

But stepping back and may be reframing a little bit, just to put this in context for AMG, Third Avenue is, from a run rate earnings contribution standpoint, 1% of our earnings. So really, no impact to AMG's financials from their results. And you didn't ask this, but to the extent anybody has a question, we don't think that Third Avenue has any legal exposure around the focus credit fund closure, et cetera, but we are completely comfortable that AMG has no legal exposure at all given our structure and approach. And so going forward, while it is, it's been a difficult period for Third Avenue, and obviously, attracted a lot of publicity and perhaps, a lot of uncertainty around any potential exposure to AMG. I -- hopefully, these comments make that crystal clear."

So just to step back a bit, if you think about alternatives book, right we've got, as you sort of described it, we've got -- we can think in sort of a more liquid and illiquid strategies and we can also think about it along this dimension that you laid out about sort of structured product and locked assets. I think we also need to think about the fact that there are things that are not necessarily sort of legally locked structures, but for all intents and purposes, they're sort of very, very stable asset basis, separate account, sort of GP funded one kind of structure. And that's a significant portion of our alternatives book. On -- when you talk about the fund raising pipeline, it's a source of particular strength for us, right? So right now, we're having good traction or exceptional traction on the liquids side, unique funds like AQR in our existing Affiliate group, they've done a fantastic job. And if you look at new Affiliates from [indiscernible] and the opportunities there, that's very strong with macro results. So the opportunity set there is really extraordinary. And then on the illiquid side, I'd sort of call out firms like Pantheon, where they've got good -- they have had a really good year. The forward opportunity set looks very, very good, both in the sort of the traditional private equity primaries and secondaries, but also, they have really broadened out their capabilities in infrastructure. And now I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks in real assets. And those are really high demand product areas, the track record, early track record is very, very good, and they think they can put a lot of assets to work. And also, I think you'll see, continued product development, frankly, in both sides, liquid and illiquid. And as we've talked about in prior calls, I think we are very well positioned to help these firms as they bring new products to market because of the sort of the quality of engagement we have with the marketplace, both on the institutional side, right? And that we have these good dialogues worldwide, but also, in the packaging, in bringing product to the retail marketplace. And again, the example I'll highlight here, last year was bringing the Pantheon private equity capability set to the DC marketplace, both in CIT and mutual fund form. And sort of first clients demanded there -- first DC clients demanded there. And I think that's the kind of business where both -- we can add a lot of value, and we're going to see real good growth. But in sum, the new business pipeline for our alternatives set, liquid and illiquid, is really good."

So which is a very institutional sell, where we're leveraging, they're already very strong distribution capabilities, but we are adding geographical to it. Contrast that with a firm like the SouthernSun or River Road. SouthernSun, very quickly, integrated them into our retail distribution. But again, when we experienced there, it's very hard -- there's no sort of here it's the base case. But they are fully integrated into our retail distribution and working day 1 with a firm like River Road, where we actually knew on the distribution side already. And so we're working with and have done something from the product development and also extending their product distribution into the wires [indiscernible] where they or we're not working with them instead of [indiscernible] . So even the short answer is we're making really good progress of all those firms integrating them in. I do think, even -- 2014 is not that long ago, and so the trajectory impact, I think is probably more impacted by the macro things than what's going on within the product sets, what's going on with the various distribution channel.

We think that those trends remain intact and then if you look at our business, we've got the large number of good performing products that continues to grow, both from product development within our Affiliates as well as this quarter is a great example, the addition of a whole bunch of fantastic new products that we can leverage.

Assets unde",823,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016, which is an increase over the first quarter 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets under management were $642 billion at quarter end, an increase of 5% in the quarter, driven by successful execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of 2 new Affiliate investments during the quarter and the excellent investment performance and net flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe further, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth ahead. 
We were very pleased with our net client cash flows of over $5 billion into our Affiliates actively managed strategies this quarter, which were notable, especially given the muted investor risk appetite across the industry more broadly. With more than $110 billion in net inflows over the past 5 years, we continue to benefit from the ongoing success for our global distribution strategy, including the marketing efforts of our Affiliates as well as the strength of our global distribution platform. And importantly, our organic growth also reflects the quality of our boutique Affiliates and the impact of our strategic focus of high value-added, alpha-generating products, including global equities and alternatives. 
The best boutique firms have a competitive advantage in generating excess returns in these product areas as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. And it is clear from AMG's organic growth results that clients continue to prefer boutiques across a range of differentiated return-oriented strategies.
The advantages of boutiques and alpha-oriented products are especially evident in the alternatives area. While there has been much discussion recently about the challenges facing hedge funds, especially in certain strategies, there are 2 points that are important to keep in mind. First, volatility among managers is both inevitable and healthy and over time, it will benefit the best firms with the strongest franchises. Second, the alternative product area encompasses a much broader range of strategies than hedge funds alone. And during the first quarter of 2016, AMG's Affiliates continued to generate strong investment performance and net flows across a wide array of alternative products.
In an environment of low returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors increasingly seek diversifying and uncorrelated return streams, and they are expanding allocations to a wide cross-section of alternative strategies. With a broad range of liquid and illiquid strategies from industry leaders including AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon and ValueAct, AMG is well positioned to meet an increasing client appetite for the best alternative products.
Likewise, we also see substantial opportunities for global equity managers given the ongoing erosion of home country bias and continued globalization of client portfolios. And the outstanding global equity manager such as Artemis, Harding Loevner, Genesis, Veritas and Tweedy Browne are clearly positioned to benefit. And while the prevailing popular narrative is that active investing underperforms passive, as we all know, averages by definition do not tell a complete story.
AMG recently published the results of research, focusing on the investment performance of boutique firms over 20 years, with the finding that boutiques clearly outperform broad indices over the period. Our Affiliates long-term performance track records across many market environments speak for themselves, and it's clear to us of that there will always be strong client demand for high conviction, differentiated, actively managed strategies.
Finally, turning to new investments. We were very pleased to complete our investments in Systematica and Baring Asia during the quarter, 2 outstanding new Affiliates which enhance the diversity of our alternative product set. As an exemplified by these and other new Affiliate investments, the founders of leading independent investment firms want to create an enduring franchise, which will persist across generations while preserving their operational and investment culture and autonomy, and they need a permanent ownership solution to enable them to achieve these goals.
The largest and most successful boutiques around the world attach special importance to finding a permanent partner with global scale and a demonstrable and outstanding long-term track record of partnerships with other excellent firms. It's clear from the discussions we're having with prospective Affiliates that AMG's preeminent position as a partner to leading boutique firms is becoming more important than ever, and we're extremely optimistic about our forward prospects to invest in the finance boutique firms globally. 
While volatile markets create challenges, they also reveal opportunities, and the transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG. We are very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline. We're confident in our ability to make additional accretive investments in new Affiliates. And together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we are uniquely positioned for a continued strong earnings growth going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliate results in more detail."
24445,332020149,970707,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility, our Affiliates, including specially largest Affiliates, performed very well. We generated good organic growth with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash flows",1396,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility, our Affiliates, including specially largest Affiliates, performed very well. We generated good organic growth with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash flows coming in across all 3 of our distribution channels. 
Before getting into the details of the quarter, let me start with a couple of the themes that cut across our business. First, we continue to benefit from some durable trends you've heard us talk about many times before, and Sean mentioned a couple of these. The highest-quality boutiques are generate performance across return-oriented product categories. Institutions and their intermediaries are continuing to their portfolios between passive exposures on the one side and active exposures on the other, but they are seeking to excess return. Because of their ability to outperform high-quality boutiques such as our Affiliates, our variable position to together these return-seeking assets. There's a related point here also, which is that boutiques are very well suited to nimbly evolve their products for these opportunities. The trait inherent in the entrepreneurial successful boutiques and one that we see in our own Affiliates. We believe all of these trends contributed to the $110 billion in net positive flows over the past 5 years that Sean referenced. 
Second, let me take a moment to frame our alternatives for you. Our alternative business is made up of private equity, infrastructure, multi-strategy and other nontraditional products as well as traditional hedge funds in areas such as long/short equity, relative value credit and managed futures. All of these provide different alternative exposures to client portfolios. We continue to have very strong alternative flows across all 3 of our distribution channels. In fact, this was the fifth consecutive quarter that alternative strategies have had positive flows in all 3 channels, which is a testament to the breadth of our offerings as well as the ability of our Affiliates to evolve their products various channels while staying true to their investment disciplines.
We think the strong investor interest in alternative product is likely to continue or even accelerate. 
Third, specific to the institutional channel, I would note a couple of things in terms of the first quarter, growth inflows were muted relative to our very strong longer-term track record as investors slowed down the pace capital during the market volatility last quarter. On the other hand, we did not have any significant idiosyncratic outflows in the quarter. Now while institutional flows will always be lumpy, looking ahead, we feel very good given the long-term trends we've talked about and the activity level in terms of searches and funnels. Fourth and finally, we obviously, had a very good flow quarter in our Mutual Fund channel, particularly in alternative and global equity funds. In addition, the outflows from our U.S. equity funds slowed significantly as especially Yacktman has been performing very well during the volatility in the last 4 quarters. Looking ahead, given the strength in our position, the diversity of products with contraction and the evolution of new products, we continue to believe that there's a significant long-term opportunities to drive material growth in retail.
Now turning to our product categories and performance for the first quarter and starting with alternatives. Across our Affiliate group, we have one of the largest managers of alternative products in the world. And as I described earlier, we have been diverse portfolio across product categories and investment styles and including large-scale exposure to both liquid products and illiquid products is truly a differentiating feature. In terms of performance and starting on the illiquid side, in the quarter, a number of strategies in AQR delivered solid absolute and relative performance notably managed futures, global risk premium, long/short equity and equity market neutral. Our new Affiliates at Systematica also had a good quarter, and its flagship strategy featured strong positive returns in the quarter. Although you may have seen from publicly available data that many managed futures products, including some managed by Systematica and AQR have pulled back in April. 
Lastly, leaders strategy at First Quadrant including comments and essential data delivered good returns in the quarter. On the illiquid side, returns from Pantheon's infrastructure offerings and call investments remains quite strong, and they continue to diversify their product set. For example, broadening their successful infrastructure team into real assets in 2015 and they'll be in the market raising assets later this year. 
Finally, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks although they continue to have an excellent long-term track record. 
Now turning to our equity products. One theme I would highlight is that we have a number of Affiliates with significant value disciplines as part of their investment process. For the first time in several years, value meaningfully outperformed growth in the quarter. And a number of our Affiliates benefited from this. 
Starting with the global developed markets category. This value theme was evident Flagship Global Value Fund outperformed its benchmarks and peers by a sizable margin in the quarter, further improving our category track record. In addition, Harding Loevner continued to deliver good returns in the quarter across their international and global equity strategies as they added to their excellent long-term records. While [indiscernible] also results performance in the quarter. On the other hand, Artemis underperformed its benchmarks maintaining good long-term performance records in other major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Emerging markets have the best returns in the major equity asset classes, and our Affiliates performed well in the quarter. In the category, Genesis and Harding Loevner posted solid absolute and relative returns, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good returns in their emerging market strategy, while AQR was in line with the index in the quarter and has excellent relative returns over the long term. 
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, Affiliates was a significant valuation component generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers in the quarter. This includes Yacktman who's recently reopened funds featured top decile rankings in the quarter. In addition, major products at GW&K, River Road, Southern Sun and TimesSquare outperformed in the quarter. 
Now turning to flows and starting in the institutional channel. Well, I'll remind you that flows are inherent lumpy. In the quarter, we had net inflows of $285 million. In addition to the major themes I noted earlier, the key drivers of net inflows from the asset class perspective alternatives, both liquid and illiquid and emerging market equities, offset by outflows from U.S. and other equities. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to positive flows for AQR, Harding Loevner, Pantheon and Systematica. In the mutual fund channel, we have net inflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter. In addition to the major positive things I noted earlier, this quarter we also benefited from some seasonality in the U.S. as tax-deferred in the first quarter from, which meaningful allocation to return-seeking assets. From an asset class perspective, net inflows were driven by alternatives and global and emerging market equities and continue to be offset a bit by U.S. equities, although flowcharts are continuing to improve there. In our high net worth channel, we have record inflows of $1.3 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were global and emerging market equities, alternatives and municipal bonds.
Finally, let me give you some more color more broadly on the contribution of our global distribution teams this quarter. With an AMG Funds, we've established real traction from the investments we've made over the 18 months, with growing gross sale and especially platform-driven sales this past quarter. Institutionally, we have good traction with clients across the world dominated by alternatives in global equities very much consistent with the broader trends I described earlier. We continue to have a strong and growing pipeline of new opportunities, including some in the fourth quarter given the market volatility. 
Looking ahead, our Affiliates have excellent long-term track record across a wide range of strategies and a proven ability to adapt to the evolving in the marketplace while staying true to their investment disciplines. Because of this, we are very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive significant positive flows across all 3 of our distribution channels both from our Affiliates selling efforts as well as complementary global distribution teams. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jay."

As Sean discussed, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which included an increase in assets under management of 5% as compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to significant growth from net client cash flows and new investm",607,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which included an increase in assets under management of 5% as compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to significant growth from net client cash flows and new investments. Given the strength and diversity of our Affiliates and the substantial cash generated by the scale of our business, we continue to produce stable and growing earnings even in periods of market volatility.
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.09. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.92. 
Now turning to more specific modeling items. For the first quarter, our EBITDA was $215.7 million and the ratio over EBITDA to end of the period of assets under management was approximately 13.4 basis points or approximately 13 basis points excluding performance fees. These figures include a full quarter impact of EBITDA from Systematica and Baring Asia, which closed at the beginning of January. In the second quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.5 basis points. 
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34.3% and our cash tax rate was 20.4%. Going forward for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $22.1 million, and in the second quarter, we expect this number to remain at approximately $22 million. Our share of reported amortization for the first quarter was $34.4 million, which included $14.2 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the second quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $34 million.
Our share of interest expense for the first quarter was $22.3 million. And in the second quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $22 million.
Our economic items for the first quarter were negative $1.1 million, which included a noncash imputed gain of $1.7 million related to our contingent payment obligations. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. Given the outlook for new investments that Sean described, we continue to position our balance sheet to have the capacity and flexibility to execute on our new investment strategy while also returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we closed on 2 new investments and repurchased $33 million in shares. 
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.70 to $14.20. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately $54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.
As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course,, substantial changes in earnings would impact these expectations. 
Now, we'll be happy to answer your questions."

It was really based on 2 factors the higher mark for AUM since our last call and an updated performance fee assumption for the year, and so I'll take both of those. The building blocks on the market assumption we last gave guidance on February 2, which is our fourth quarter call. At that time, our market blend was down about 4%, but has since rebounded toward the end of the quarter, which you can see in our AUM table. In the second quarter to date, through May 2, we estimate our market blend up approximately 1%, which is in line with broader markets. Just to remind you, and you mentioned the model convention. In the quarter, we removed for model purposes the 2% beta assumption. We replaced it with we experienced what it suited, which is the 1% I just mentioned. So in summary, from the point of our last call till the updated guidance today, our model is up 4%. And then, as you know,, thereafter starting in the third quarter, we assumed 2% quarterly market growth for the third and fourth quarter to round out our 2016 market assumption. On performance fees, we've updated that assumption as well given that we're 4 months into the year. And while it's still early, we now expect our performance fees to be approximately 8% of the midpoint of our range, which is down modestly since the last time we gave guidance. As you also know the breadth and diversity of our performance fee opportunity creates a positive asymmetry. The decreases the probability of achieving the low end of our guidance while at the top end, there's a greater expected value. So there is a symmetry in our performance fee opportunity. And finally, just remind you, as I say every time, we talk about performance fees, we only account for performance fee when we recognized them to cash."

So, as you know, we said that gross sales were a little lower than prior periods. And I think there was no single factor that really drove it. We called that one, which is risk aversion delayed funding so we definitely saw some of that. Also I'm just saying in the last quarter, we didn't see any lumpy capital commitments to sort of long lock periods, which is something that happens with some frequency. And then again a little bit of the margin seasonality of Q1 is often a somewhat light quarter. But again so now moving to looking ahead to the current quarter, second quarter and looking ahead, the flows are lumpy and it's still early. But we feel very good both because of the long-term trends we talked about as well as we can see the things that we have already funded this quarter and some of those the ones we talked about that slipped a few things already this quarter. And I just look at the level of activity in our fees and funnels and whatnot. So I feel really good about that. And in terms of the geography and product, I said the geographies quite broad. U.S., non-U.S., really globally, the activity level is very high. And in terms of product, I think the things we've been talking about, which is especially alternatives in non-U.S. equities are places we still continue to see the strongest institutional traction."

When you look at the largest contributors to flows in recent quarters, I don't think it's been so much an issue. And I'll say that for a couple of reasons. So one is we do have Affiliates who are managing their capacity. I guess, managing the pace of flows as they're coming in. But a lot of the places we're seeing flows and we alluded to those in our prepared remarks with talking about the product development opportunity from our Affiliates that are seeing good flows. There's a lot of good, large capacity product coming online at Affiliates. And so when I think coming online what you mean by that is getting into that sweet spot where they've got of the track record. They've got enough assets is critical mass, and they can drive flows. And so that good 3-year track record kind of range. But even in some of these new areas, even that's less important. So plenty of new products coming online. And some of this also I think we talked about this as well of the new packaging theme, right? which begun to really be helpful bringing its additional products into retail channels or bringing products that are performing [indiscernible] geography into another. And then the final thing I will say, it's also very important to remember that we have a sort of unique product opportunity, which is visibility to bring on new Affiliates. So as we look back talked about the 2 [ph] -- last ones we talked about Systematica and Baring, those are very different, unique, highly attractive product sets today as well as good product development opportunities within each of those firms. And we're starting with to work with both of them on ways to both broaden their geographic reach of their distribution to work with bringing new products to market and so we're very excited about the new product opportunity."

But I think if you look underneath and say, ""Where are the most successful firms gaining share and getting positive flows?"" and that really is around word and recognizing that notwithstanding what we read in the popular press, the very best high-active share alpha-oriented equity managers especially non-U.S. equity and alternative managers. And alternative is a much broader category and it's for all that we hear about individual hedge funds in certain isolated strategies, the truth is broadly speaking around the world, there's increasing interest in allocation toward the best alternative firms. And so we feel like we're playing this consistent product strategy that we've been executing now for almost 20 years is increasingly attractive to clients and you're seeing that in our results, and we're increasingly positive about the forward opportunities in the last bit is this in our view, appreciation that clients have more and more of the -- in the alpha-oriented product set of the advantages of the very best boutique firms and their focus and discipline and in all of the other attributes that make boutiques -- or best boutiques attractive. So all of those broad things very much in place, very much playing into our core product strategy. Nate, do you want to talk about specific Affiliates our Affiliates probably?"

Let me walk you through just as simple we believe overall, there's a very high-quality level across our boutiques and they do obviously, a wide range of different things. Those things will come in and out of flavor over time and they each have their own dedicated strong distribution teams in their own regions and channels as we find them and they are growing organically very well and they're excellent distances, we can marry that. Just a little bit into the prior question as well, which is we can marry that to the scope and scale of our organization. Whether again as appropriate, distribution or legal and compliance or what have you. And we can help bring their product and the product as they evolve them, bring them into the most appropriate marketplaces in the world for that product or process or the amount of capacity they want to use and use the best place to find the best matches for them with the most appropriate distribution channels and clients. And then opportunity is combine the best of boutiques with some of the scale in scale activity distribution and legal, for example, and you need both in order to effectively bring a product around the world and into different channels. So that's a part of it. And then the other part is increasingly, is we're interacting with the marketplace and we have of our Affiliates, we're able to bring the Affiliates' products to the marketplace and with the marketplace want. And so were having a marketplace of joined up in that the conversation to partner with other consultants or intermediaries or end users large scale end-users in the marketplace and get the Affiliates product into the, right? And the so there really is a very powerful dynamic, which is as the products move in and out of flavor, we can take the ones we can get them in the right places and again, as the Affiliates want as well.

I don't think I said that the volatility in the first quarter has pushed things out. I think the math reference was around the pipeline in terms of new client mandates as opposed to new Affiliate investments. And so with the new Affiliate investments, I think the opportunity set, the environment, our relative position, are really as good as they can be. And we feel quite positive about the opportunity to add new Affiliates from a universe of -- a broad universe of outstanding firms and where we were going to choose to invest in really the most outstanding firms who fit both our -- within our culture and philosophy, but also, of course, the quality and commitment to building an enduring franchise. And so we see that opportunity set that challenged that has is to manage our capital position in a way that maintains substantial flexibility. And I think if you look over the last 5 years or indeed beyond that almost the entirety of our corporate history, we've had, I think, very effective capital management. We've had a commitment to not holding a lot of cash on the balance sheet to returning cash and especially in the form of repurchases to shareholders, but also to make sure that we're positioned to execute on new investment opportunities when they arise. And they often arise in groups and at times where you can't necessarily choose and so you just have to be ready. Jay can answer the question at a high level, it's the business generates over $1 billion in EBITDA. We have lots of cash that is available to invest in new Affiliates. We have a revolver that has lots of spare capacity and we could, of course, increase it. But the other point is -- and to your question without additional financing. Look, we don't have an issue with going to the capital markets, including with equity. Where we see an opportunity, and anytime we do that, it will be a highly accretive, attractive transaction set for and I say set because by definition, that would mean it's at some scale. So those kinds of opportunities, however, financed, I think are very attractive to our shareholders and we'll pursue them. So it really -- there's no constraint in the way we think about capacity.

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016, which is an increase over the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets u",825,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016, which is an increase over the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets under management were $642 billion at quarter end, an increase of 5% in the quarter, driven by successful execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of 2 new Affiliate investments during the quarter and the excellent investment performance and net flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe further, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth ahead.
We were very pleased with our net client cash flows of over $5 billion into our Affiliates actively managed strategies this quarter, which were notable, especially given the muted investor risk appetite across the industry more broadly. With more than $110 billion in net inflows over the past 5 years, we continue to benefit from the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy, including the marketing efforts of our Affiliates as well as the strength of our global distribution platform. And importantly, our organic growth also reflects the quality of our boutique Affiliates and the impact of our strategic focus of high value-added, alpha-generating products, including global equities and alternatives.
The best boutique firms have a competitive advantage in generating excess returns in these product areas as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. And it is clear from AMG's organic growth results that clients continue to prefer boutiques across a range of differentiated return-oriented strategies.
The advantages of boutiques and alpha-oriented products are especially evident in the alternatives area. While there has been much discussion recently about the challenges facing hedge funds, especially in certain strategies, there are 2 points that are important to keep in mind: first, volatility among managers is both inevitable and healthy, and over time, it will benefit the best firms with the strongest franchises; second, the alternative product area encompasses a much broader range of strategy -- strategies than hedge funds alone. And during the first quarter of 2016, AMG's Affiliates continued to generate strong investment performance and net flows across a wide array of alternative products.
In an environment of low returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors increasingly seek diversifying and uncorrelated return streams, and they are expanding allocations to a wide cross section of alternative strategies. With a broad range of liquid and illiquid strategies from industry leaders, including AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon and ValueAct, AMG is well positioned to meet an increasing client appetite for the best alternative products.
Likewise, we also see substantial opportunities for global equity managers given the ongoing erosion of home country bias and continued globalization of client portfolios. And the outstanding global equity managers, such as Artemis, Harding Loevner, Genesis, Veritas and Tweedy, Browne are clearly positioned to benefit. And while the prevailing popular narrative is that active investing underperforms passive, as we all know, averages by definition to not tell a complete story.
AMG recently published the results of research, focusing on the investment performance of boutique firms over 20 years with the finding that boutiques clearly outperform broad indices over the period. Our Affiliates long-term performance track records across many market environments speak for themselves, and it's clear to us that there will always be strong client demand for high conviction, differentiated, actively managed strategies.
Finally, turning to new investments. We were very pleased to complete our investments in Systematica and Baring Asia during the quarter, 2 outstanding new Affiliates which enhance the diversity of our alternative product set. As exemplified by these and other new Affiliate investments, the founders of leading independent investment firms want to create an enduring franchise, which will persist across generations while preserving their operational and investment culture and autonomy, and they need a permanent ownership solution to enable them to achieve these goals.
The largest and most successful boutiques around the world attach special importance to finding a permanent partner with global scale and a demonstrable and outstanding long-term track record of partnerships with other excellent firms. It's clear from the discussions we're having with prospective Affiliates that AMG's preeminent position as a partner to leading boutique firms is becoming more important than ever, and we're extremely optimistic about our forward prospects to invest in the finance boutique firms globally.
While volatile markets create challenges, they also reveal opportunities, and the transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG. We are very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline. We're confident in our ability to make additional accretive investments in new Affiliates. And together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we are uniquely positioned for a continued strong earnings growth going forward.
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliate results in more detail."
24445,332020149,971124,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility, our Affiliates, including and specially our largest Affiliates, performed very well.

As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility, our Affiliates, including and specially our largest Affiliates, performed very well. We generated good organic growth with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash flows coming in across all 3 of our distribution channels.
Before getting into the details of the quarter, let me start with a couple of the themes that cut across our business. First, we continue to benefit from some durable trends you've heard us talk about many times before, and Sean mentioned a couple of these. The highest-quality boutiques are able to generate outperformance across return-oriented product categories. Institutions and their intermediaries are continuing to barbell their portfolios between passive exposures on the one side and active exposures on the other where they were seeking their excess return. Because of their ability to outperform, high-quality boutiques, such as our Affiliates, are very well positioned to gather these return-seeking assets. There's a related point here also, which is that boutiques are very well suited to nimbly evolve their products for these opportunities. This is the trait inherent in the entrepreneurial spirit of successful boutiques and one that we see in our own Affiliates. We believe all of these trends contributed to the $110 billion in net positive flows over the past 5 years that Sean referenced.
Second, let me take a moment to frame our alternatives book for you. Our alternatives business is made up of private equity, infrastructure, various macro, multi-strategy and other nontraditional products as well as traditional hedge funds in areas such as long/short equity, relative value credit and managed futures. All of these provide different alternative exposures to client portfolios. We continue to have very strong alternative flows across all 3 of our distribution channels. In fact, this was the fifth consecutive quarter that alternative strategies have had positive flows in all 3 channels, which is a testament to the breadth of our offerings as well as the ability of our Affiliates to evolve their products for the various channels while staying true to their investment disciplines.
We think the strong investor interest in alternative product is likely to continue or even accelerate.
Third, specific to the institutional channel, I would note a couple of things. In terms of the first quarter, growth inflows were muted relative to our very strong longer-term track record as investors slowed down the pace of which they put capital to work during the market volatility last quarter. On the other hand, we did not have any significant idiosyncratic outflows in the quarter. Now while institutional flows will always be lumpy, looking ahead, we feel very good given the long-term trends we've talked about and the activity level in terms of RFPs, searches and finals.
Fourth and finally, we obviously had a very good flow quarter in our Mutual Fund channel, particularly on alternative and global equity funds. In addition, the outflows from our U.S. equity funds slowed significantly as -- especially Yacktman has been performing very well during the volatility in the last 4 quarters. Looking ahead, given the strength in our position, the diversity of products with good traction and the evolution of new products, we continue to believe there's a significant long-term opportunities to drive material growth in retail.
Now turning to our product categories and performance for the first quarter and starting with alternatives. Across our Affiliate group, we have one of the largest managers in alternative products in the world. And as I described earlier, we have a very diverse portfolio across product categories and investment styles and including large-scale exposure to both liquid and illiquid products is truly a differentiating feature.
In terms of performance and starting on the more liquid side, in the quarter, a number of strategies in AQR delivered solid, absolute and relative performance notably managed futures, global risk premium, long/short equity and equity market neutral. Our new Affiliate, Systematica, also had a good quarter, and its flagship, BlueTrend strategy, featured strong positive returns in the quarter, although you may have seen from publicly available data that many managed futures products, including some managed by Systematica and AQR, have pulled back in April.
Lastly, major strategies at First Quadrant, including currency and essential data, delivered good returns in the quarter. On the illiquid side, returns from Pantheon's infrastructure offerings and call investments remain quite strong, and they continue to diversify their product set, for example, broadening their successful infrastructure team into real assets in 2015. And they'll be in the market raising a real assets fund later this year.
Finally, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they continue to have an excellent long-term track record.
Now turning to our equity products. One theme I would highlight is that we have a number of Affiliates with significant value disciplines as part of their investment process. For the first time in several years, value meaningfully outperformed growth in the quarter, and a number of our Affiliates benefited from this.
Starting with the global developed markets category. This value theme was evident as Tweedy, Browne's flagship, Global Value Fund, outperformed its benchmarks and peers by a sizable margin in the quarter, further improving their category leading track record. In addition, Harding Loevner continued to deliver good returns in the quarter across their international and global equity strategies as they added to their excellent long-term records, while AQR also delivered solid performance in the quarter. On the other hand, Artemis underperformed its benchmarks, while they still maintaining good long-term performance records in their major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Emerging markets had the best returns in the major equity asset classes, and our Affiliates performed well in the quarter. In the category, Genesis and Harding Loevner posted solid, absolute and relative returns, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good relative returns in their emerging market strategy, while AQR was in line with the MSCI EM Index in the quarter and has excellent relative returns over the long term.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, Affiliates with a significant valuation component generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers in the quarter. This includes Yacktman who's recently reopened funds featured top decile rankings in the quarter. In addition, major products at GW&K, River Road, SouthernSun and TimesSquare outperformed in the quarter.
Now turning to flows and starting in the institutional channel. Well, I'll remind you that flows are inherent lumpy. In the quarter, we had net inflows of $285 million. In addition to the major themes I noted earlier, the key drivers of net inflows from the asset class perspective for alternatives, both liquid and illiquid and emerging market equities, offset by outflows from U.S. and other equities. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to positive flows were AQR, Harding Loevner, Pantheon and Systematica. In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter. In addition to the major positive themes I noted earlier, this quarter, we also benefited from some seasonality in the U.S. as tax-deferred accounts funded in the first quarter, some of which have a meaningful allocation to return-seeking assets. From an asset class perspective, net inflows were driven by alternatives in global and emerging markets equities and continued to be offset a bit by U.S. equities, although flow trends are continuing to improve there.
In our high net worth channel, we had record inflows of $1.3 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were global and emerging markets equities, alternatives and municipal bonds.
Finally, let me give you some color more broadly on the contribution of our global distribution teams this quarter. Within AMG Funds, we've established real traction from the investments we've made over the 18 months with growing gross sales and especially in platform-driven sales this past quarter. Institutionally, we have good traction with clients across the world dominated by alternatives and global equities, very much consistent with the broader trends I described earlier. We continue to have a strong and growing pipeline of new opportunities, including some that got pushed from the fourth quarter given the market volatility.
Looking ahead, our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide range of strategies and a proven ability to adapt to the evolving needs in the marketplace while staying true to their investment disciplines. Because of this, we are very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive significant positive flows across all 3 of our distribution channels, both from our Affiliate-selling efforts as well as those of our complementary global distribution teams.
With that, I'll turn it to Jay."

As Sean discussed, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which included an increase in assets under management of 5% as compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to significant growth from net client cash flows and new investments. Given the strength and diversity of our Affiliates and the substantial cash generated by the scale of our business, we continue to produce stable and growing earnings even in periods of market volatility.
As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.09. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.92.
Now turning to more specific modeling items. For the first quarter, our EBITDA was $215.7 million, and the ratio over EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.4 basis points or approximately 13 basis points excluding performance fees. These figures include a full quarter impact of EBITDA from Systematica and Baring Asia, which closed at the beginning of January. In the second quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.5 basis points.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34.3% and our cash tax rate was 20.4%. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $22.1 million. And in the second quarter, we expect this number to remain at approximately $22 million.
Our share of reported amortization for the first quarter was $34.4 million, which included $14.2 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the second quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $34 million.
Our share of interest expense for the first quarter was $22.3 million. And in the second quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $22 million.
Our economic items for the first quarter were negative $1.1 million, which included a noncash imputed gain of $1.7 million related to our contingent payment obligations. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. Given the outlook for new investments that Sean described, we continue to position our balance sheet to have the capacity and flexibility to execute on our new investment strategy while also returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we closed on 2 new investments and repurchased $33 million in shares.
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.70 to $14.20. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.
As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contribution of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So let's start from the beginning. We did raise our guidance for 2016 to $12.70 to $14.20. And it was really based on 2 factors: the higher mark for AUM since our last call; and an updated performance fee assumption for the year, and so I'll take both of those. The building blocks on the market assumption, we last gave guidance on February 2, which is our fourth quarter call. At that time, our market blend was down about 4% but has since rebounded toward the end of the quarter, which you can see in our AUM table. In the second quarter to date through May 2, we estimate our market blend up approximately 1%, which is in line with broader markets. Just to remind you, and you mentioned the model convention, in the quarter, we removed for model purposes the 2% beta assumption. We replaced it with the -- what we experienced quarter-to-date, which is the 1% I just mentioned. So in summary, from the point of our last call until the updated guidance today, our model is up 4%. And then, as you know, thereafter, starting in the third quarter, we assumed 2% quarterly market growth for the third and fourth quarter to round out our 2016 market assumption. On performance fees, we've updated that assumption as well given that we're 4 months into the year. And while it's still early, we now expect our performance fees to be approximately 8%, at the midpoint of our range, which is down modestly since the last time we gave guidance. As you also know, the breadth and diversity of our performance fee opportunity creates a positive asymmetry. It decreases the probability of achieving the low end of our guidance, while at the top end, there's a greater expected value. So there is asymmetry in our performance fee opportunity. And finally, just remind you, as I say every time we talk about performance fees, we only account for performance fee when we recognized them to cash."

So as you know, we said that gross sales were a little lower than prior periods. And I think there was no single factor that really drove it.

Also, I'll just say, in the last quarter, we didn't see any lumpy capital commitments to sort of long lock periods, which is something that happens with some frequency. And then, again, a little bit at the margin seasonality. Q1 is often a somewhat light quarter. But -- again, so now moving to looking ahead to the current quarter, the second quarter and looking ahead, repeat that the flows, the institutional flows are all lumpy and it's still early. But we feel very good both because of the long-term trends we talked about as well as we can see the things that have already funded this quarter, and some of those were the ones we talked about that slipped, a few things have already funded this quarter.

And there's absolutely some places where there are capacity issues. When you look at the largest contributors to flows in the recent quarters, I don't think it's been so much an issue, and I'll say that for a couple of reasons. So one is we do have Affiliates in there who are managing their capacity, I guess, sort of managing the pace of flows as they're coming in. But a lot of the places we're seeing flows, and we alluded to this in our prepared remarks with talking about the product development opportunity from our Affiliates that are seeing good flows, there's a lot of good, large capacity product coming online at Affiliates. And so when I say coming online, what I mean by that is they're getting into that sweet spot where they've got the track record, they've got enough assets, so that's critical mass, and they can drive flows, and so that good 3-year track record kind of range. But even in some of these new areas, it's that -- even that's less important. So plenty of new products coming online, and some of this also, and I think we talked about this as well, the new packaging theme, right, which is -- and that is a place where we can really be helpful, which is bringing institutional products into retail channels or bringing products that are performing very well in one geography into another. And then the final thing I'll say, it's also very important to remember that we have a sort of unique product development opportunity, which is this ability to bring on new Affiliates, right? So as you look back at the 2 -- the last firms talked about, Systematica and Baring, those are very different, unique, highly attractive product sets today as well as good product development opportunities within each of those firms. And we're starting with to work with both of them on ways to both broaden the geographic reach of their distribution but also to work with them bringing their new products to market. And so we're very excited about the new product development opportunity."

But recognize that if you have a global partner with capabilities and experience around the world, both directly and then coordinating among other Affiliates that there's, of course, an advantage. And so I think, it -- the regulatory effects, generally, are setting aside the element of regulation that is positive and needed.

I think the trends that have been in place -- well, across the industry, I think we are still a bit swimming against the current in terms of where industry flow trends are generally, and you can judge that by the results that you've seen our peers put up and what you know about the industry generally. But I think if you look underneath and say where are the most successful firms gaining share and getting positive flows, and it really is around barbelling and recognizing that notwithstanding what we read in the popular press, the very best high-active share alpha-oriented equity managers, especially non-U.S. equity and alternative managers. And alternative is a much broader category, and it's for all that we hear about individual hedge funds and certain isolated strategies, the truth is that broadly speaking, around the world, there's increasing interest in allocation toward the best alternative firms. And so we feel like we're playing this consistent product strategy that we've been executing now for almost 20 years is increasingly attractive to clients, and you're seeing that in our results. And we're increasingly positive about the forward opportunities. And the last bit is this, in our view, appreciation that clients have more and more of the -- in the alpha-oriented product set of the advantages of the very best boutique firms and their focus and discipline and nimbleness and all of the other attributes that make boutiques, the best boutiques attractive. So all of those broad things very much in place, very much playing into our core product strategy.

And the products, as they evolve them, bring them into the most appropriate marketplaces in the world for that product or process or the amount of capacity that they want to use and where is the best place to find the best matches for them with the most appropriate distribution channels and clients. And that opportunity will sort of combine the best of boutiques with some of the scale, in scale activities, distribution and legal clients are good examples, and you need both in order to effectively bring a product around the world and into different channels. So that's a part of it. And then the other part is increasingly, as we're interacting with the marketplace on behalf of our Affiliates, we're able to bring the Affiliate's products to the marketplace in the way the marketplace wants, right? So it's -- we're having a marketplace joined up conversation and sort of partnership with the consultants or intermediaries or end users, large scale end-users in these marketplaces and we get the Affiliate product into the right package for those end users. And so there really is a very powerful sort of dynamic, which is, as the products move in and out of favor, we can take the ones that are in favor, get them matched up with the right places and again, as the Affiliates want. So I hope that helped [ph]."

I don't think I've said that the volatility in the first quarter has pushed things out. I think the -- that reference was around the pipeline in terms of new client mandates as opposed to new Affiliate investments. And so with the new Affiliate investments, I think the opportunity set, the environment, our relative position are really as good as they can be. And we feel quite positive about the opportunity to add new Affiliates from a universe of -- a broad universe of outstanding firms and where we were going to choose to invest in really the most outstanding firms, who fit both our -- within our culture and philosophy but also, of course, the quality and commitment to building an enduring franchise. And so we see that opportunity set, the challenge that Jay always has is to manage our capital position in a way that maintains substantial flexibility. And I think if you'll look over the last 5 years or indeed, beyond that, almost the entirety of our corporate history, we've had, I think, very effective capital management. We've had a commitment to not holding a lot of cash on the balance sheet to returning cash and especially in the form of repurchases to shareholders but also to make sure that we're positioned to execute on new investment opportunities when they arise. And they often arise in groups and at times where you can't necessarily choose, and so you just have to be ready. The -- Jay can answer the question, but at a high level, it's -- the business generates over $1 billion in EBITDA. We have lots of -- that cash is available to invest in new Affiliates. We have a revolver that has lots of spare capacity, and we could, of course, increase it. But the other point is, in your question, without additional financing, look, we don't have an issue with going to the capital markets, including with equity. Where we see an opportunity, and any time we do that, it will be a highly accretive, attractive transaction set for -- and I say set because by definition, that would mean it's at some scale. So those kinds of opportunities however financed, I think, are very attractive to our shareholders, and we'll pursue them. So it really -- there's no constraint in the way we think about capacity.
Jay, do you want to add?"

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016, which is an increase over the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets u",822,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016, which is an increase over the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets under management were $642 billion at quarter end, an increase of 5% in the quarter, driven by successful execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of 2 new Affiliate investments during the quarter and the excellent investment performance and net flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe further, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth ahead.
We were very pleased with our net client cash flows of over $5 billion into our Affiliates actively managed strategies this quarter, which were notable, especially given the muted investor risk appetite across the industry more broadly. With more than $110 billion in net inflows over the past 5 years, we continue to benefit from the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy, including the marketing efforts of our Affiliates as well as the strength of our global distribution platform. And importantly, our organic growth also reflects the quality of our boutique Affiliates and the impact of our strategic focus of high value-added, alpha-generating products, including global equities and alternatives.
The best boutique firms have a competitive advantage in generating excess returns in these product areas as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. And it is clear from AMG's organic growth results that clients continue to prefer boutiques across a range of differentiated return-oriented strategies.
The advantages of boutiques and alpha-oriented products are especially evident in the alternatives area. While there has been much discussion recently about the challenges facing hedge funds, especially in certain strategies, there are 2 points that are important to keep in mind: first, volatility among managers is both inevitable and healthy, and over time, it will benefit the best firms with the strongest franchises; second, the alternative product area encompasses a much broader range of strategies than hedge funds alone. And during the first quarter of 2016, AMG's Affiliates continued to generate strong investment performance and net flows across a wide array of alternative products.
In an environment of low returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors increasingly seek diversifying and uncorrelated return streams, and they are expanding allocations to a wide cross-section of alternative strategies. With a broad range of liquid and illiquid strategies from industry leaders, including AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon and ValueAct, AMG is well positioned to meet an increasing client appetite for the best alternative products.
Likewise, we also see substantial opportunities for global equity managers given the ongoing erosion of home country bias and continued globalization of client portfolios. And the outstanding global equity managers, such as Artemis, Harding Loevner, Genesis, Veritas and Tweedy, Browne are clearly positioned to benefit. And while the prevailing popular narrative is that active investing underperforms passive, as we all know, averages by definition to not tell a complete story.
AMG recently published the results of research, focusing on the investment performance of boutique firms over 20 years with the finding that boutiques clearly outperform broad indices over the period. Our Affiliates long-term performance track records across many market environments speak for themselves, and it's clear to us that there will always be strong client demand for high conviction, differentiated, actively managed strategies.
Finally, turning to new investments. We were very pleased to complete our investments in Systematica and Baring Asia during the quarter, 2 outstanding new Affiliates which enhance the diversity of our alternative product set. As exemplified by these and other new Affiliate investments, the founders of leading independent investment firms want to create an enduring franchise, which will persist across generations while preserving their operational and investment culture and autonomy, and they need a permanent ownership solution to enable them to achieve these goals.
The largest and most successful boutiques around the world attach special importance to finding a permanent partner with global scale and a demonstrable and outstanding long-term track record of partnerships with other excellent firms. It's clear from the discussions we're having with prospective Affiliates that AMG's preeminent position as a partner to leading boutique firms is becoming more important than ever, and we're extremely optimistic about our forward prospects to invest in the finance boutique firms globally.
While volatile markets create challenges, they also reveal opportunities, and the transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG. We are very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline. We're confident in our ability to make additional accretive investments in new Affiliates. And together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we are uniquely positioned for a continued strong earnings growth going forward.
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliate results in more detail."
24445,332020149,971297,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility our Affiliates, including Specialty,  our largest Affiliate, performed very well. We generated good organic growth with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash fl",1444,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility our Affiliates, including Specialty,  our largest Affiliate, performed very well. We generated good organic growth with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash flows coming in across all 3 of our distribution channels.
Before getting into the details of the quarter, let me start with a couple of the themes that cut across our business. First, we continue to benefit from some durable trends you've heard us talk about many times before, and Sean mentioned a couple of these. The highest-quality boutiques are able to generate outperformance across return-oriented product categories. Institutions and their intermediaries are continuing to barbell their portfolios between passive exposures on the one side and active exposures on the other where they were seeking their excess return. Because of their ability to outperform, high-quality boutiques, such as our Affiliates, are very well positioned to gather these return-seeking assets. There's a related point here also, which is that boutiques are very well suited to nimbly evolve their products for these opportunities. This is the trait inherent in the entrepreneurial spirit of successful boutiques and one that we see in our own Affiliates. We believe all of these trends contributed to the $110 billion in net positive flows over the past 5 years that Sean referenced.
Second, let me take a moment to frame our alternatives book for you. Our alternatives business is made up of private equity, infrastructure, various macro, multi-strategy and other nontraditional products as well as traditional hedge funds in areas such as long/short equity, relative value credit and managed futures. All of these provide different alternative exposures to client portfolios. We continue to have very strong alternative flows across all 3 of our distribution channels. In fact, this was the fifth consecutive quarter that our alternative strategies have had positive flows in all 3 channels, which is a testament to the breadth of our offerings as well as the ability of our Affiliates to evolve their products for the various channels while staying true to their investment disciplines.
We think the strong investor interest in alternative product is likely to continue or even accelerate.
Third, specific to the institutional channel, I would note a couple of things. In terms of the first quarter, growth inflows were muted relative to our very strong longer-term track record as investors slowed down the pace of which they put capital to work during the market volatility last quarter. On the other hand, we did not have any significant idiosyncratic outflows in the quarter. Now while institutional flows will always be lumpy, looking ahead, we feel very good given the long-term trends we've talked about and the activity level in terms of RFPs, searches and finals.
Fourth and finally, we obviously had a very good flow quarter in our Mutual Fund channel, particularly on alternative and global equity funds. In addition, the outflows from our U.S. equity funds slowed significantly as the Specialty Yacktman has been performing very well during the volatility of the last 4 quarters. Looking ahead, given the strength in our position, the diversity of products with good traction and the evolution of new products, we continue to believe there's a significant long-term opportunities to drive material growth in retail.
Now turning to our product categories and performance for the first quarter and starting with alternatives. Across our Affiliate group, we are one of the largest managers in alternative products in the world. And as I described earlier, we have a very diverse portfolio across product categories and investment styles and including large-scale exposure to both liquid and illiquid products is truly a differentiating feature.
In terms of performance and starting on the more liquid side, in the quarter, a number of strategies at AQR delivered solid, absolute and relative performance notably managed futures, global risk premium, long/short equity and equity market neutral. Our new Affiliate, Systematica, also had a good quarter, and its flagship, BlueTrend strategy, featured strong positive returns in the quarter, although you may have seen from publicly available data that many managed futures products, including some managed by Systematica and AQR, have pulled back in April.
Lastly, major strategies at First Quadrant, including currency and essential data, delivered good returns in the quarter. On the illiquid side, returns from Pantheon's infrastructure offerings and call investments remain quite strong, and they continue to diversify their product set, for example, broadening their successful infrastructure team into real assets in 2015. And they'll be in the market raising a real assets fund later this year.
Finally, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they continue to have an excellent long-term track record.
Now turning to our equity products. One theme I would highlight is that we have a number of Affiliates with significant value disciplines as part of their investment process. For the first time in several years, value meaningfully outperformed growth in the quarter, and a number of our Affiliates benefited from this.
Starting with the global developed markets category. This value theme was evident as Tweedy, Browne's flagship, Global Value Fund, outperformed its benchmarks and peers by a sizable margin in the quarter, further improving their category leading track record. In addition, Harding Loevner continued to deliver good returns in the quarter across their international and global equity strategies as they added to their excellent long-term records, while AQR also delivered solid performance in the quarter. On the other hand, Artemis underperformed its benchmarks, while they still maintaining good long-term performance records in their major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Emerging markets had the best returns in the major equity asset classes, and our Affiliates performed well in the quarter. In the category, Genesis and Harding Loevner posted solid, absolute and relative returns, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good relative returns in their emerging market strategy, while AQR was in line with the MSCI EM Index in the quarter and has excellent relative returns over the long term.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, Affiliates with a significant valuation component generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers in the quarter. This includes Yacktman who's recently reopened funds featured top decile rankings in the quarter. In addition, major products at GW&K, River Road, SouthernSun and TimesSquare outperformed in the quarter.
Now turning to flows and starting in the institutional channel. Well, I'll remind you that flows are inherent lumpy. In the quarter, we had net inflows of $285 million. In addition to the major themes I noted earlier, the key drivers of net inflows from an asset class perspective were alternatives, both liquid and illiquid and emerging market equities, offset by outflows from U.S. and other equities. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to positive flows were AQR, Harding Loevner, Pantheon and Systematica. In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter. In addition to the major positive themes I noted earlier, this quarter, we also benefited from some seasonality in the U.S. as tax-deferred accounts funded in the first quarter, some of which have a meaningful allocation to return-seeking assets. From an asset class perspective, net inflows were driven by alternatives in global and emerging markets equities and continued to be offset a bit by U.S. equities, although flow trends are continuing to improve there.
In our high net worth channel, we had record inflows of $1.3 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were global and emerging markets equities, alternatives and municipal bonds.
Finally, let me give you some color more broadly on the contribution of our global distribution teams this quarter. Within AMG Funds, we've established real traction from the investments we've made over the 18 months with growing gross sales and especially in platform-driven sales this past quarter. Institutionally, we have good traction with clients across the world dominated by alternatives and global equities, very much consistent with the broader trends I described earlier. We continue to have a strong and growing pipeline of new opportunities, including some that got pushed from the fourth quarter given the market volatility.
Looking ahead, our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide range of strategies and a proven ability to adapt to the evolving needs in the marketplace while staying true to their investment disciplines. Because of this, we are very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive significant positive flows across all 3 of our distribution channels, both from our Affiliate-selling efforts as well as those of our complementary global distribution teams.
With that, I'll turn it to Jay."

As Sean discussed, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which included an increase in assets under management of 5% as compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to significant growth from net client cash flows and new investments. Given the strength and diversity of our Affiliates and the substantial cash generated by the scale of our business, we continue to produce stable and growing earnings even in periods of market volatility.
As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.09. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.92.
Now turning to more specific modeling items. For the first quarter, our EBITDA was $215.7 million, and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.4 basis points, or approximately 13 basis points excluding performance fees. These figures include a full quarter impact of EBITDA from Systematica and Baring Asia, which closed at the beginning of January. In the second quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.5 basis points.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34.3% and our cash tax rate was 20.4%. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $22.1 million. And in the second quarter, we expect this number to remain at approximately $22 million.
Our share of reported amortization for the first quarter was $34.4 million, which includes $14.2 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the second quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $34 million.
Our share of interest expense for the first quarter was $22.3 million. And in the second quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $22 million.
Our economic items for the first quarter were negative $1.1 million, which included a noncash imputed gain of $1.7 million related to our contingent payment obligations. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. Given the outlook for new investments that Sean described, we continue to position our balance sheet to have the capacity and flexibility to execute on our new investment strategy while also returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we closed on 2 new investments and repurchased $33 million in shares.
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.70 to $14.20. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.
As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings.

So let's start from the beginning. We did raise our guidance for 2016 to $12.70 to $14.20. And it was really based on 2 factors: the higher mark for AUM since our last call; and an updated performance fee assumption for the year, and so I'll take both of those. The building blocks on the market assumption, we last gave guidance on February 2, which is our fourth quarter call. At that time, our market blend was down about 4% but has since rebounded toward the end of the quarter, which you can see in our AUM table. In the second quarter to date through May 2, we estimate our market blend up approximately 1%, which is in line with broader markets. Just to remind you, and you mentioned the model convention, in the quarter, we removed for model purposes the 2% beta assumption. We replaced it with the -- what we've experienced quarter-to-date, which is the 1% I just mentioned. So in summary, from the point of our last call until the updated guidance today, our model is up 4%. And then, as you know, thereafter, starting in the third quarter, we assume 2% quarterly market growth for the third and fourth quarter to round out our 2016 market assumption. 
On performance fees, we've updated that assumption as well given that we're 4 months into the year. And while it's still early, we now expect our performance fees to be approximately 8%, at the midpoint of our range, which is down modestly since the last time we gave guidance. As you also know, the breadth and diversity of our performance fee opportunity creates a positive asymmetry. It decreases the probability of achieving the low end of our guidance, while at the top end, there's a greater expected value. So there is asymmetry in our performance fee opportunity. And finally, just remind you, as I say every time we talk about performance fees, we only account for performance fee when we recognized them to cash."

So as you know, we said that gross sales were a little lower than prior periods. And I think there was no single factor that really drove it. We called out one, which is this quarter sort of risk aversion, delayed funding, so we definitely saw some of that. Also, I'll just say, in the last quarter, we didn't see any lumpy capital commitments to sort of long lock periods, which is something that happens with some frequency. And then, again, a little bit at the margin seasonality. Q1 is often a somewhat light quarter. But -- again, so now moving to looking ahead to the current quarter, the second quarter and looking ahead, repeat that the flows, the institutional flows are always lumpy and it's still early. But we feel very good both because of the long-term trends we talked about as well as we can see the things that have already funded this quarter, and some of those were the ones we talked about that slipped, a few of the things have already funded this quarter. And then, yes, just look at the level of activity in RFPs and finals and whatnot. So feel really good about that. And in terms of geography and product, I'd say the geographies quite broad.

And there's absolutely some places where there are capacity issues. When you look at the largest contributors to flows in the recent quarters, I don't think it's been so much an issue, and I'll say that for a couple of reasons. So one is we do have Affiliates in there who are managing their capacity, I guess, sort of managing the pace of flows as they're coming in. But a lot of the places we're seeing flows, and we alluded to this in our prepared remarks with talking about the product development opportunity from our Affiliates that are seeing good flows, there's a lot of good, large capacity product coming online at Affiliates. And so when I say coming online, what I mean by that is they're getting into that sweet spot where they've got the track record, they've got enough assets, so that's critical mass, and they can drive flows, and sort of that good 3-year track record kind of range. But even in some of these new areas, it's that -- even that's less important. So plenty of new products coming online, and some of it's also, and I think we talked about this as well, the new packaging theme, right, which is -- and that is a place where we can really be helpful, which is bringing institutional products into retail channels or bringing products that are performing very well in one geography into another. And then the final thing I'll say, it's also very important to remember that we have a sort of unique product development opportunity, which is this ability to bring on new Affiliates, right? So as you look back at the 2 -- the last firms talked about, Systematica and Baring, those are very different, unique, highly attractive product sets today as well as good product development opportunities within each of those firms. And we're starting with to work with both of them on ways to both broaden the geographic reach of their distribution but also to work with them bringing their newer products to market. And so we're very excited about the new product development opportunity."

With respect to flows, and this is really just echoing what Nate and I said in our prepared remarks and Nate earlier in response to a question, we see continued good momentum in retail, which is growth in the funds that are having positive flows and kind of abatement or lessening of outflows in some other areas and generally good performance across the group.

But recognize that if you have a global partner with capabilities and experience around the world, both directly and then coordinating among other Affiliates that there's, of course, an advantage.

I think the trends that have been in place -- well, across the industry, I think we are still a bit swimming against the current in terms of where industry flow trends are generally, and you can judge that by the results that you've seen our peers put up and what you know about the industry generally. But I think if you look underneath and say where are the most successful firms gaining share and getting positive flows, and it really is around barbelling and recognizing that notwithstanding what we read in the popular press, the very best high-active share alpha-oriented equity managers, especially non-U.S. equity and alternative managers. And alternative is a much broader category, and it's for all that we hear about individual hedge funds and certain isolated strategies, the truth is that broadly speaking, around the world, there's increasing interest in allocation toward the best alternative firms. And so we feel like we're playing this consistent product strategy that we've been executing now for almost 20 years is increasingly attractive to clients, and you're seeing that in our results. And we're increasingly positive about the forward opportunities. And the last bit is this, in our view, appreciation that clients have more and more of the -- in the alpha-oriented product set of the advantages of the very best boutique firms and their focus and discipline and nimbleness and all of the other attributes that make boutiques -- the best boutiques attractive. So all of those broad things very much in place, very much playing into our core product strategy.

Let me add one -- well, I think, really just one piece on top of that. So you have -- you understand, obviously, there's 500-plus products and new products being developed as we talked about earlier, all the time. When you think about the framework you were using, which is where the flow opportunity is and sort of how we think about that mix and the evolution, let me walk you through just a sort of simple exercise here, which is look, we believe, overall, there's a very high-quality level across our boutiques, and they do, obviously, a wide range of different things. Those things will come in and out of favor over time, and they each have their own dedicated strong distribution teams in their own regions and channels as we find them. And they're growing organically very well, and they're excellent distances. We can marry that. This relates a little bit to the prior question as well, which is we can marry that to the scope and scale of our organization, whether that's in -- again, as appropriate, whether that's in distribution or in legal and compliance or what have you, and we can help bring their products. And the products, as they evolve them, bring them into the most appropriate marketplaces in the world for that product or process or the amount of capacity that they want to use and where is the best place to find the best matches for them with the most appropriate distribution channels and clients. And that opportunity to sort of combine the best of boutiques with some of the scale, in scale activities, distribution and legal and clients are good examples, and you need both in order to effectively bring a product around the world and into different channels. So that's a part of it. And then the other part is increasingly, as we're interacting with the marketplace on behalf of our Affiliates, we're able to bring the Affiliate's products to the marketplace in the way the marketplace wants, right? So it's -- we're having a marketplace joined up conversation and sort of partnership with the consultants or intermediaries or end users, large scale end-users in these marketplaces and we get the Affiliate product into the right package for those end users. And so that really is a very powerful sort of dynamic, which is, as the products move in and out of favor, we can take the ones that are in favor, get them matched up with the right places and again, as the Affiliates want. So I just thought I would add that on top."

I don't think I'd said that the volatility in the first quarter has pushed things out. I think the -- that reference was around the pipeline in terms of new client mandates as opposed to new Affiliate investments. And so with the new Affiliate investments, I think the opportunity set, the environment, our relative position are really as good as they can be. And we feel quite positive about the opportunity to add new Affiliates from a universe of -- a broad universe of outstanding firms and where we were going to choose to invest in really the most outstanding firms, who fit both our -- within our culture and philosophy but also, of course, the quality and commitment to building an enduring franchise. And so we see that opportunity set, the challenge that Jay always has is to manage our capital position in a way that maintains substantial flexibility. And I think if you'll look over the last 5 years or indeed, beyond that, almost the entirety of our corporate history, we've had, I think, very effective capital management. We've had a commitment to not holding a lot of cash on the balance sheet to returning cash and especially in the form of repurchases to shareholders but also to make sure that we're positioned to execute on new investment opportunities when they arise. And they often arise in groups and at times where you can't necessarily choose, and so you just have to be ready. The -- Jay can answer the question, but at a high level, it's -- the business generates over $1 billion in EBITDA. We have lots of -- that cash is available to invest in new Affiliates. We have a revolver that has lots of spare capacity, and we could, of course, increase it. But the other point is, in your question, without additional financing, look, we don't have an issue with going to the capital markets, including with equity. Where we see an opportunity, and any time we do that, it will be a highly accretive, attractive transaction set for -- and I say set because by definition, that would mean it's at some scale. So those kinds of opportunities however financed, I think, are very attractive to our shareholders, and we'll pursue them. So it really -- there's no constraint in the way we think about capacity.
Jay, do you want to add?"

AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016, which is an increase over the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets u",822,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016, which is an increase over the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets under management were $642 billion at quarter end, an increase of 5% in the quarter, driven by successful execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of 2 new Affiliate investments during the quarter and the excellent investment performance and net flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe further, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth ahead.
We were very pleased with our net client cash flows of over $5 billion into our Affiliates actively managed strategies this quarter, which were notable, especially given the muted investor risk appetite across the industry more broadly. With more than $110 billion in net inflows over the past 5 years, we continue to benefit from the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy, including the marketing efforts of our Affiliates as well as the strength of our global distribution platform. And importantly, our organic growth also reflects the quality of our boutique Affiliates and the impact of our strategic focus of high value-added, alpha-generating products, including global equities and alternatives.
The best boutique firms have a competitive advantage in generating excess returns in these product areas as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. And it is clear from AMG's organic growth results that clients continue to prefer boutiques across a range of differentiated return-oriented strategies.
The advantages of boutiques and alpha-oriented products are especially evident in the alternatives area. While there has been much discussion recently about the challenges facing hedge funds, especially in certain strategies, there are 2 points that are important to keep in mind: first, volatility among managers is both inevitable and healthy, and over time, it will benefit the best firms with the strongest franchises; second, the alternative product area encompasses a much broader range of strategies than hedge funds alone. And during the first quarter of 2016, AMG's Affiliates continued to generate strong investment performance and net flows across a wide array of alternative products.
In an environment of low returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors increasingly seek diversifying and uncorrelated return streams, and they are expanding allocations to a wide cross-section of alternative strategies. With a broad range of liquid and illiquid strategies from industry leaders, including AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon and ValueAct, AMG is well positioned to meet an increasing client appetite for the best alternative products.
Likewise, we also see substantial opportunities for global equity managers given the ongoing erosion of home country bias and continued globalization of client portfolios. And the outstanding global equity managers, such as Artemis, Harding Loevner, Genesis, Veritas and Tweedy, Browne are clearly positioned to benefit. And while the prevailing popular narrative is that active investing underperforms passive, as we all know, averages by definition to not tell a complete story.
AMG recently published the results of research, focusing on the investment performance of boutique firms over 20 years with the finding that boutiques clearly outperform broad indices over the period. Our Affiliates long-term performance track records across many market environments speak for themselves, and it's clear to us that there will always be strong client demand for high conviction, differentiated, actively managed strategies.
Finally, turning to new investments. We were very pleased to complete our investments in Systematica and Baring Asia during the quarter, 2 outstanding new Affiliates which enhance the diversity of our alternative product set. As exemplified by these and other new Affiliate investments, the founders of leading independent investment firms want to create an enduring franchise, which will persist across generations while preserving their operational and investment culture and autonomy, and they need a permanent ownership solution to enable them to achieve these goals.
The largest and most successful boutiques around the world attach special importance to finding a permanent partner with global scale and a demonstrable and outstanding long-term track record of partnerships with other excellent firms. It's clear from the discussions we're having with prospective Affiliates that AMG's preeminent position as a partner to leading boutique firms is becoming more important than ever, and we're extremely optimistic about our forward prospects to invest in the finance boutique firms globally.
While volatile markets create challenges, they also reveal opportunities, and the transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG. We are very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline. We're confident in our ability to make additional accretive investments in new Affiliates. And together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we are uniquely positioned for a continued strong earnings growth going forward.
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliate results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility our Affiliates, including Specialty, our largest Affiliate, performed very well.

As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility our Affiliates, including Specialty, our largest Affiliate, performed very well. We generated good organic growth with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash flows coming in across all 3 of our distribution channels.
Before getting into the details of the quarter, let me start with a couple of the themes that cut across our business. First, we continue to benefit from some durable trends you've heard us talk about many times before, and Sean mentioned a couple of these. The highest-quality boutiques are able to generate outperformance across return-oriented product categories. Institutions and their intermediaries are continuing to barbell their portfolios between passive exposures on the one side and active exposures on the other where they were seeking their excess return. Because of their ability to outperform, high-quality boutiques, such as our Affiliates, are very well positioned to gather these return-seeking assets. There's a related point here also, which is that boutiques are very well suited to nimbly evolve their products for these opportunities. This is the trait inherent in the entrepreneurial spirit of successful boutiques and one that we see in our own Affiliates. We believe all of these trends contributed to the $110 billion in net positive flows over the past 5 years that Sean referenced.
Second, let me take a moment to frame our alternatives book for you. Our alternatives business is made up of private equity, infrastructure, various macro, multi-strategy and other nontraditional products as well as traditional hedge funds in areas such as long/short equity, relative value credit and managed futures. All of these provide different alternative exposures to client portfolios. We continue to have very strong alternative flows across all 3 of our distribution channels. In fact, this was the fifth consecutive quarter that our alternative strategies have had positive flows in all 3 channels, which is a testament to the breadth of our offerings as well as the ability of our Affiliates to evolve their products for the various channels while staying true to their investment disciplines.
We think the strong investor interest in alternative product is likely to continue or even accelerate.
Third, specific to the institutional channel, I would note a couple of things. In terms of the first quarter, growth inflows were muted relative to our very strong longer-term track record as investors slowed down the pace of which they put capital to work during the market volatility last quarter. On the other hand, we did not have any significant idiosyncratic outflows in the quarter. Now while institutional flows will always be lumpy, looking ahead, we feel very good given the long-term trends we've talked about and the activity level in terms of RFPs, searches and finals.
Fourth and finally, we obviously had a very good flow quarter in our Mutual Fund channel, particularly on alternative and global equity funds. In addition, the outflows from our U.S. equity funds slowed significantly as the Specialty Yacktman has been performing very well during the volatility of the last 4 quarters. Looking ahead, given the strength in our position, the diversity of products with good traction and the evolution of new products, we continue to believe there's a significant long-term opportunities to drive material growth in retail.
Now turning to our product categories and performance for the first quarter and starting with alternatives. Across our Affiliate group, we are one of the largest managers in alternative products in the world. And as I described earlier, we have a very diverse portfolio across product categories and investment styles and including large-scale exposure to both liquid and illiquid products is truly a differentiating feature.
In terms of performance and starting on the more liquid side, in the quarter, a number of strategies at AQR delivered solid, absolute and relative performance notably managed futures, global risk premium, long/short equity and equity market neutral. Our new Affiliate, Systematica, also had a good quarter, and its flagship, BlueTrend strategy, featured strong positive returns in the quarter, although you may have seen from publicly available data that many managed futures products, including some managed by Systematica and AQR, have pulled back in April.
Lastly, major strategies at First Quadrant, including currency and essential data, delivered good returns in the quarter. On the illiquid side, returns from Pantheon's infrastructure offerings and call investments remain quite strong, and they continue to diversify their product set, for example, broadening their successful infrastructure team into real assets in 2015. And they'll be in the market raising a real assets fund later this year.
Finally, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they continue to have an excellent long-term track record.
Now turning to our equity products. One theme I would highlight is that we have a number of Affiliates with significant value disciplines as part of their investment process. For the first time in several years, value meaningfully outperformed growth in the quarter, and a number of our Affiliates benefited from this.
Starting with the global developed markets category. This value theme was evident as Tweedy, Browne's flagship, Global Value Fund, outperformed its benchmarks and peers by a sizable margin in the quarter, further improving their category leading track record. In addition, Harding Loevner continued to deliver good returns in the quarter across their international and global equity strategies as they added to their excellent long-term records, while AQR also delivered solid performance in the quarter. On the other hand, Artemis underperformed its benchmarks, while they still maintaining good long-term performance records in their major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Emerging markets had the best returns in the major equity asset classes, and our Affiliates performed well in the quarter. In the category, Genesis and Harding Loevner posted solid, absolute and relative returns, adding to their excellent long-term track record of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good relative returns in their emerging market strategy, while AQR was in line with the MSCI EM Index in the quarter and has excellent relative returns over the long term.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, Affiliates with a significant valuation component generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers in the quarter. This includes Yacktman who's recently reopened funds featured top decile rankings in the quarter. In addition, major products at GW&K, River Road, SouthernSun and TimesSquare outperformed in the quarter.
Now turning to flows and starting in the institutional channel. Well, I'll remind you that flows are inherent lumpy. In the quarter, we had net inflows of $285 million. In addition to the major themes I noted earlier, the key drivers of net inflows from an asset class perspective were alternatives, both liquid and illiquid and emerging market equities, offset by outflows from U.S. and other equities. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to positive flows were AQR, Harding Loevner, Pantheon and Systematica. In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter. In addition to the major positive themes I noted earlier, this quarter, we also benefited from some seasonality in the U.S. as tax-deferred accounts funded in the first quarter, some of which have a meaningful allocation to return-seeking assets. From an asset class perspective, net inflows were driven by alternatives in global and emerging markets equities and continued to be offset a bit by U.S. equities, although flow trends are continuing to improve there.
In our high net worth channel, we had record inflows of $1.3 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were global and emerging markets equities, alternatives and municipal bonds.
Finally, let me give you some color more broadly on the contribution of our global distribution teams this quarter. Within AMG Funds, we've established real traction from the investments we've made over the 18 months with growing gross sales and especially in platform-driven sales this past quarter. Institutionally, we have good traction with clients across the world dominated by alternatives and global equities, very much consistent with the broader trends I described earlier. We continue to have a strong and growing pipeline of new opportunities, including some that got pushed from the fourth quarter given the market volatility.
Looking ahead, our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide range of strategies and a proven ability to adapt to the evolving needs in the marketplace while staying true to their investment disciplines. Because of this, we are very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive significant positive flows across all 3 of our distribution channels, both from our Affiliate-selling efforts as well as those of our complementary global distribution teams.
With that, I'll turn it to Jay."

As Sean discussed, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which included an increase in assets under management of 5% as compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to significant growth from net client cash flows and new investments. Given the strength and diversity of our Affiliates and the substantial cash generated by the scale of our business, we continue to produce stable and growing earnings even in periods of market volatility.
As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.09. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.92.
Now turning to more specific modeling items. For the first quarter, our EBITDA was $215.7 million, and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.4 basis points, or approximately 13 basis points excluding performance fees. These figures include a full quarter impact of EBITDA from Systematica and Baring Asia, which closed at the beginning of January. In the second quarter of 2016, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.5 basis points.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34.3% and our cash tax rate was 20.4%. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $22.1 million. And in the second quarter, we expect this number to remain at approximately $22 million.
Our share of reported amortization for the first quarter was $34.4 million, which includes $14.2 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the second quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $34 million.
Our share of interest expense for the first quarter was $22.3 million. And in the second quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $22 million.
Our economic items for the first quarter were negative $1.1 million, which included a noncash imputed gain of $1.7 million related to our contingent payment obligations. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. Given the outlook for new investments that Sean described, we continue to position our balance sheet to have the capacity and flexibility to execute on our new investment strategy while also returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we closed on 2 new investments and repurchased $33 million in shares.
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.70 to $14.20. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the third quarter of 2016.
We also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million for the year.
The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.
As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contribution of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions."

And as you know, it's a volatile quarter. So let's start from the beginning. We did raise our guidance for 2016 to $12.70 to $14.20.

So let's start from the beginning. We did raise our guidance for 2016 to $12.70 to $14.20. And it was really based on 2 factors: the higher mark for AUM since our last call; and an updated performance fee assumption for the year, and so I'll take both of those. The building blocks on the market assumption, we last gave guidance on February 2, which is our fourth quarter call. At that time, our market blend was down about 4% but has since rebounded toward the end of the quarter, which you can see in our AUM table. In the second quarter to date through May 2, we estimate our market blend up approximately 1%, which is in line with broader markets. Just to remind you, and you mentioned the model convention, in the quarter, we removed for model purposes the 2% beta assumption. We replaced it with the -- what we've experienced quarter-to-date, which is the 1% I just mentioned. So in summary, from the point of our last call until the updated guidance today, our model is up 4%. And then, as you know, thereafter, starting in the third quarter, we assume 2% quarterly market growth for the third and fourth quarter to round out our 2016 market assumption. 
On performance fees, we've updated that assumption as well given that we're 4 months into the year. And while it's still early, we now expect our performance fees to be approximately 8%, at the midpoint of our range, which is down modestly since the last time we gave guidance. As you also know, the breadth and diversity of our performance fee opportunity creates a positive asymmetry. It decreases the probability of achieving the low end of our guidance, while at the top end, there's a greater expected value. So there is asymmetry in our performance fee opportunity. And finally, just remind you, as I say every time we talk about performance fees, we only account for performance fee when we recognized them to cash."

Also, I'll just say, in the last quarter, we didn't see any lumpy capital commitments to sort of long lock periods, which is something that happens with some frequency. And then, again, a little bit at the margin seasonality. Q1 is often a somewhat light quarter. But -- again, so now moving to looking ahead to the current quarter, the second quarter and looking ahead, repeat that the flows, the institutional flows are always lumpy and it's still early. But we feel very good both because of the long-term trends we talked about as well as we can see the things that have already funded this quarter, and some of those were the ones we talked about that slipped, a few of the things have already funded this quarter. And then, yes, just look at the level of activity in RFPs and finals and whatnot. So feel really good about that. And in terms of geography and product, I'd say the geographies quite broad. U.S., non-U.S., really globally, the activity level is very high.

And there's absolutely some places where there are capacity issues. When you look at the largest contributors to flows in the recent quarters, I don't think it's been so much an issue, and I'll say that for a couple of reasons. So one is we do have Affiliates in there who are managing their capacity, I guess, sort of managing the pace of flows as they're coming in. But a lot of the places we're seeing flows, and we alluded to this in our prepared remarks with talking about the product development opportunity from our Affiliates that are seeing good flows, there's a lot of good, large capacity product coming online at Affiliates. And so when I say coming online, what I mean by that is they're getting into that sweet spot where they've got the track record, they've got enough assets, so that's critical mass, and they can drive flows, and sort of that good 3-year track record kind of range. But even in some of these new areas, it's that -- even that's less important. So plenty of new products coming online, and some of it's also, and I think we talked about this as well, the new packaging theme, right, which is -- and that is a place where we can really be helpful, which is bringing institutional products into retail channels or bringing products that are performing very well in one geography into another. And then the final thing I'll say, it's also very important to remember that we have a sort of unique product development opportunity, which is this ability to bring on new Affiliates, right? So as you look back at the 2 -- the last firms talked about, Systematica and Baring, those are very different, unique, highly attractive product sets today as well as good product development opportunities within each of those firms. And we're starting with to work with both of them on ways to both broaden the geographic reach of their distribution but also to work with them bringing their newer products to market. And so we're very excited about the new product development opportunity."

But recognize that if you have a global partner with capabilities and experience around the world, both directly and then coordinating among other Affiliates that there's, of course, an advantage. And so I think, it -- the regulatory effects, generally are, setting aside the element of regulation that is positive and needed, much of the regulatory regime, as I said, is probably decreasing efficiency and making business more challenging for all asset management firms.

I think the trends that have been in place -- well, across the industry, I think we are still a bit swimming against the current in terms of where industry flow trends are generally, and you can judge that by the results that you've seen our peers put up and what you know about the industry generally. But I think if you look underneath and say where are the most successful firms gaining share and getting positive flows, and it really is around barbelling and recognizing that notwithstanding what we read in the popular press, the very best high-active share alpha-oriented equity managers, especially non-U.S. equity and alternative managers. And alternative is a much broader category, and it's for all that we hear about individual hedge funds and certain isolated strategies, the truth is that broadly speaking, around the world, there's increasing interest in allocation toward the best alternative firms. And so we feel like we're playing this consistent product strategy that we've been executing now for almost 20 years is increasingly attractive to clients, and you're seeing that in our results. And we're increasingly positive about the forward opportunities. And the last bit is this, in our view, appreciation that clients have more and more of the -- in the alpha-oriented product set of the advantages of the very best boutique firms and their focus and discipline and nimbleness and all of the other attributes that make boutiques -- the best boutiques attractive. So all of those broad things very much in place, very much playing into our core product strategy.

So you have -- you understand, obviously, there's 500-plus products and new products being developed as we talked about earlier, all the time. When you think about the framework you were using, which is where the flow opportunity is and sort of how we think about that mix and the evolution, let me walk you through just a sort of simple exercise here, which is look, we believe, overall, there's a very high-quality level across our boutiques, and they do, obviously, a wide range of different things. Those things will come in and out of favor over time, and they each have their own dedicated strong distribution teams in their own regions and channels as we find them. And they're growing organically very well, and they're excellent distances. We can marry that. This relates a little bit to the prior question as well, which is we can marry that to the scope and scale of our organization, whether that's in -- again, as appropriate, whether that's in distribution or in legal and compliance or what have you, and we can help bring their products. And the products, as they evolve them, bring them into the most appropriate marketplaces in the world for that product or process or the amount of capacity that they want to use and where is the best place to find the best matches for them with the most appropriate distribution channels and clients. And that opportunity to sort of combine the best of boutiques with some of the scale, in scale activities, distribution and legal and clients are good examples, and you need both in order to effectively bring a product around the world and into different channels. So that's a part of it. And then the other part is increasingly, as we're interacting with the marketplace on behalf of our Affiliates, we're able to bring the Affiliate's products to the marketplace in the way the marketplace wants, right? So it's -- we're having a marketplace joined up conversation and sort of partnership with the consultants or intermediaries or end users, large scale end-users in these marketplaces and we get the Affiliate product into the right package for those end users. And so that really is a very powerful sort of dynamic, which is, as the products move in and out of favor, we can take the ones that are in favor, get them matched up with the right places and again, as the Affiliates want. So I just thought I would add that on top."

I don't think I'd said that the volatility in the first quarter has pushed things out. I think the -- that reference was around the pipeline in terms of new client mandates as opposed to new Affiliate investments. And so with the new Affiliate investments, I think the opportunity set, the environment, our relative position are really as good as they can be. And we feel quite positive about the opportunity to add new Affiliates from a universe of -- a broad universe of outstanding firms and where we were going to choose to invest in really the most outstanding firms, who fit both our -- within our culture and philosophy but also, of course, the quality and commitment to building an enduring franchise. And so we see that opportunity set, the challenge that Jay always has is to manage our capital position in a way that maintains substantial flexibility. And I think if you'll look over the last 5 years or indeed, beyond that, almost the entirety of our corporate history, we've had, I think, very effective capital management. We've had a commitment to not holding a lot of cash on the balance sheet to returning cash and especially in the form of repurchases to shareholders but also to make sure that we're positioned to execute on new investment opportunities when they arise. And they often arise in groups and at times where you can't necessarily choose, and so you just have to be ready. The -- Jay can answer the question, but at a high level, it's -- the business generates over $1 billion in EBITDA. We have lots of -- that cash is available to invest in new Affiliates. We have a revolver that has lots of spare capacity, and we could, of course, increase it. But the other point is, in your question, without additional financing, look, we don't have an issue with going to the capital markets, including with equity. Where we see an opportunity, and any time we do that, it will be a highly accretive, attractive transaction set for -- and I say set because by definition, that would mean it's at some scale. So those kinds of opportunities however financed, I think, are very attractive to our shareholders, and we'll pursue them. So it really -- there's no constraint in the way we think about capacity.
Jay, do you want to add?"

Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our p",793,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our pro forma assets, bringing our total assets under management to approximately $700 billion.  Our Affiliates produced excellent relative investment performance and positive net client cash flows, and we added outstanding new Affiliates, including Winton Capital Management and Capula Investment Management. As Jay will describe, given the increased earnings power of our business, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth for the balance of the year and through 2017.
Notwithstanding market volatility, which resulted in industry-wide risk aversion, we generated positive net client cash flows during the quarter. As Nate will discuss, our strong net inflows in the retail and high net worth channels, were partially offset by lower institutional sales especially at the end of the quarter as a number of global institutional clients decided to pause implementation of investment decisions in response to the unexpected outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit referendum.  We believe that this was essentially a short-term response and looking ahead as markets have stabilized, and investor expectations adjusted, we are seeing a assumption in sales momentum and expect to benefit from these delayed fundings through the balance of the year.
We also believe that rising dispersion in the markets will increasingly favor differentiated performance-oriented strategies, including focus active equities in a range of value-added alternative investment products. Our Affiliates' equity strategy has performed well in the quarter, including Tweedy, Browne, Harding Loevner and Genesis, which all posted strong absolute and relative performance in global and emerging markets equity. In the Augmentin and TimesSquare, which in particular generated excellent results in U.S. equities.  Our alternative managers also generally performed well amid volatility, as several of our Affiliates, including HUR, First Quadrant and BlueMountain, generated meaningful alpha during the quarter.
Looking forward, contrary to conventional wisdom around challenges in the hedge fund industry, there is significant and growing client demand for alternative strategies across distribution channels, particularly those which are additive at a total portfolio level given their lack of correlation to traditional equity and fixed income markets.  We believe this is an enduring trend. The diversification and balanced risk and return offered by well-designed alternative strategies are compelling to both sophisticated global institutions, as well as individual retail investors as they strive to meet their investment goals.  We believe that clients are increasingly focusing on highest-quality managers, with long-term track records of alpha generation and those managers which have demonstrated that they can effectively manage at scale and with institutional quality. This trend benefits the highest-quality alternative firms, including our Affiliates, which are recognized as leaders in their respective disciplines, and as evidence of this, our alternative Affiliates have consistently generated positive net client cash flows over the past 5 years, including in the second quarter.
Across our group of Affiliates, we have strategically and deliberately assembled a very large and diverse set of alternative strategies, which, taken as a whole, not only generates strong organic growth, but also have low correlation with equity markets and low correlation with each other. There's no other firm in the industry with the range and quality of our alternative product set. We think that this point is undervalued by the market and that the benefit of our strategic position across a very broad range of alternative strategies will become increasingly evident.  Our substantial exposure to this array of strategies, which is, in aggregate approximately 40% of our AUM, and the highly diversified return streams they provide is not only attractive in its own right but is also a strong complement to our strategic focus on differentiated active equities through our outstanding traditional Affiliates.  As clients increasingly seek the highest-quality active managers for the alpha portions of their portfolios, our industry leading boutique Affiliates are well-positioned for continued strong organic growth going forward.
Finally, turning to new investments, we continue to have an outstanding opportunity to further enhance the diversity of our performance-oriented product set by partnering with leading traditional and alternative firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for us, and we have a diverse global pipeline of perspective new Affiliates that are drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner for over 23 years.
Given our unmatched competitive position and our strong and flexible capital structure, we are confident in our ability to execute additional accretive investments in new Affiliates, and together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, are well-positioned for continued earnings growth ahead.
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. As John said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers.  Let me begin with",1576,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As John said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers.  Let me begin with performance  in the second quarter, and start with the alternative products. Across our Affiliates, we are one of the largest managers of alternative product in the world with a very diverse portfolio of strategies across categories and investment styles. As John mentioned, the addition of a diverse series of high-quality alternative return streams to our outstanding equity boutiques significantly improves the stability of our business, while also providing enhanced long-term return profile. Now before I describe our performance in more detail, let me further break down our alternative exposure in the categories. We know these categories are broken out in our IR presentation on our website. We have 4 primary groupings. First, private equity and real assets, which includes a variety of long lock capital products such as Pantheon's global public fund and Infrastructure fund of as an efficient or fines, bearing ages emerging markets Private equity strategies and the energy and related infections in business, none of which are impeccably short-term fluctuations in a? Markets.  The next category unsystematic diversified strategy. These include our managed futures are CTA products at AQR succumb a systematic [indiscernible] which seek to deliver returns which are uncorrelated with equity markets and often substantially outperform in declining markets. The third category is fixed income and equity relative value strategies. Including those in BlueMountain and Capula, which look to provide uncorrelated fixed in the markets as well as strategies with bearing we market exposure for full exposure to market neutral. Our fourth category is multi-asset and multi-strategy, which includes products that utilize a variety of asset classes and exposures to deliver diversifying return streams for both institutional and retail clients. 
Turning now to performance and starting with our private equity and related studies with very diverse bird offer a suit for an such as Baring Asia, AIG and Pantheon. These firms have a number of current strategies with their actively putting capital to work and have excellent long-term track records. Next, turning to our systematic diversified strategies. Our Affiliates include 3 of the leading CTA managers in the world: We're benefiting not just from the diversity of the strategies provide during periods of expanded volatility into new markets but also from the excess return these farms have been able to provide pretty consistently over time.
With that as backdrop, our systematic diversified for strategies were able to navigate a volatile market in the quarter well. AQR managed futures was one of the strongest performing strategies in the space, with a positive return in the quarter and a strong long term track record. Systematica's flagship lieutenant font losses in the quarter, it is positive returns for 2016 and a very strong long-term track record.  Our investment and not associate as notice financial results for the quarter. But they also have one of the highest quality offerings in those product category and performed well in the quarter.  Among our fixed income and equity relative value strategies, BlueMountain and Capula generated positive returns in the quarter across most of their products, while ValueAct on the other hand had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmark, although they have started the third quarter very strong and continued an excellent long-term track record.
Finally, with regards to our multi-asset and multi-strategy offerings, many of our Affiliates' parts performed well in the quarter. Including but at AQR First Quadrant as evidenced by the returns of their publicly available funds and, AQR Purdy fund and AMG FQ global risk balance which drove  6% from 7% especially in addition, we saw solid gains across other significant progress in the category such as AQR stall premium, the First Quadrant [indiscernible] currency. 
Now turning to our equity products and starting with the global developed markets category, where a number of our largest products and strategies posted strong absolute and relative returns. Tweedy, Browne's flagship global value fund outperformed its benchmark and peers in the quarter, further improving its long-term track record. Through the quarter, and this fund has the top 5 and 10 year track records in money starts for large value category. In addition, Harding Loevner once again outperformed benchmarks and peers, both international and global equity strategies. Both strategy also see near or above the top decile long-term track records in their respective Morningstar categories. And the other hand, AQR has underperformed their benchmarks and the ways to McCain and then major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Turning to emerging markets category. A very broad based strong relative performance, almost all of our major products at the Affiliates including AQR, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Trilogy posted good absolute and relative returns. Standouts included Genesis, global emerging markets, and Harding Loevner emerging markets, each of which outpaced the benchmark by over 250 basis points.
Finally, with respect our U.S. equities, many of our U.S. growth strategies are biased towards quality growth and away from high beta stocks, and we benefited from that in the quarter as they generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers. This includes the largest products of Frontier and  TimesSquare. On U.S. value side, our largest U.S. equity conservator, Yacktman, saw their focused fund and diversified fund of each outperform peers for the quarter level then to maintain the top decile returns you year-to-date and for the trailing year and both fun still ranked in the first percentile in the Morningstar category across the last 10 or 15-year period.
Now turning to flows for the quarter. And I'll reiterate a close above the institutional end sub-advisory channels are [indiscernible] lumpy. First, we are pleased to generate another quarter of positive net client cash flows of $630 million, bringing us to positive flows in 22 out of the last 24 quarters. Within outflows this quarter, there couple of teams to identify. First, as we've discussed in previous calls, we remain very well-positioned to participate in the trend of rising allocations to alternatives across this [indiscernible] channels, and we benefited from this trend again this quarter. As Sean said, investors are increasingly using alternatives to achieve their investment objectives either generate uncorrelated returns or for mitigation, and our Affiliates feature some of the best of his in liquid and illiquid alternatives, high net worth investments and a lot of advance about the challenges so-called hedge funds are facing, we shall be very careful to separate those from the strong underlying trend of flows to alternatives more broadly, a trend we believe will continue which we are very well positioned to participate in. Second, the quarter was really a tale of 2 parts. And with a relatively good first 2 months giving way to June, which was impacted significantly by the Brexit vote and the volatility around it. And moving to specifics for the quarter and starting with the institutional channel, we had net outflows of $2.9 billion in the quarter. There were 3 broad reasons for the negative net flows in the channel: First, we saw the funding process for several significant mandates flow in the back half of the quarter. A couple of cases were explicitly linked to Brexit-related and see. Second, we did experience a month plus from petrodollar related clients. And third, unusually, we did not have any meaningful closes in our long lock capital products such as [indiscernible] and Baring Asia. There was really just an idiosyncratic than make related to the quarter that is significant demand for these illiquid products, but it's a matter of incidental timing you have an raising cycle across the Affiliates fact up.
Turning to the high net worth channel, we had record inflows of $1.7 billion for the quarter. Key conservatives to this quarter's strong flows were as a Minnesota or broker-dealer China, especially municipal bonds, as well as our AMG Wealth Partners platform to our continued see good traction developing.  In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. From an asset class perspective, flows this quarter were driven by strong inflows for alternatives in a major market equity offering and we continue to benefit from the much better U.S. equity redemption rates. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to net positive flows were AQR and Harding Loevner. We did have some elevated office in our U.K. Affiliate items in the second half of the quarter particularly in the U.K. oriented strategies following the Brexit not. But as Marcus recovery, we expect this to continue to debate.
More broadly, while they still that we determined regarding the outcome, we do not see the Brexit thought having a significant direct impact in our distribution efforts our Affiliates operations were badly in fact, in the area most like it to be impacted, the retail channel across the U.K. and Europe, our affiliate product offering even from our U.K.-based Affiliates are mostly domiciled outside of the U.K. and should be relatively unaffected by domiciled in the U.K. but also clients.  Working ahead, with our outstanding and growing array of high-quality equity and alternative products, along with our unique distribution strategy, which includes both the Affiliates and distribution teams as well as AMG's focused complementary resources, we believe we are very position for many for organic growth ahead.
With that, let me turn to Jay to discuss financials."

As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in a quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has a differentiated ability to produce stable and is across a range of market environments, and with the addition of winter and Capula call felt very diversified increase in his power of our business.  As you saw on the release, he reported economic earnings per share of $3.06 for the second quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.10. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.97.
Turning to more specific modeling items, for the second quarter, our EBITDA was $220.3 million and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.6 basis points or approximately 13.1 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to decline to approximately 13.1 basis points, reflecting lower performance fees, which is typical in the third quarter.  As a reminder, we will report our recent new investments on a 1 quarter lag. As a result, this will have the effect of lowering our earnings for the second half of 2016 but not thereafter. As we close Capula in July, and we expect to close Winton in the fourth quarter without reporting their respective income in the quarter in which we closed. I will further describe the timing and costs of funding of these new investments in a moment.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% and our cash tax rate was 18.8%. In the third quarter, and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%.  Intangible-related deferred taxes for the second quarter were 23 point -- $21.3 million. We expect this number to remain at approximately $21 million in the third quarter, and for the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $87 million.  On our share reported amortization for the second quarter was $37 million, which includes $14.8 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the third quarter, we expect our share of amortization to decline to approximately $35 million and for the full year 2016, we expect amortization to be approximately $145 million.  Our share of interest expense for the second quarter was $21.9 million. In the third quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to be approximately $24 million, reflecting the higher revolver balance from the closing of Capula. For the full year 2016, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $90 million.  Other economic items for the second quarter was $0.8 million, for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet, in June, we announced new investments for the total purchase price of $800 million and simultaneously entered into a forward equity contract for up to 2.9 million shares, a structure which we have used several times in the past. Of the available 2.9 million shares, we expect to issue 2.5 million shares for $400 million in proceeds in the fourth quarter upon closing Winton, with the remainder of the purchase price funded under our revolver. Given the funding profile as well as the ongoing strength of our balance sheet, and the quality and diversity of our business, we were placed on positive outlook by S&P.
With our possible capital structure, we are well-positioned for growth in a range of market environments, and looking ahead, the strength and scale of our business which generates run rate EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available by year end under our revolver, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance, we are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.30 to $13.30. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through Friday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth for the fourth quarter.  As product invention given the pacing of our 2016 new investments, our guidance does not assume incremental share repurchases for the balance of 2016. We expect our weighted average share count for 2016 to be approximately 55 million, which includes the expected equity issuance in the fourth quarter.
Given the meaningful run rate impact of our recent new investments which is not reflected in 2016, as well as a full year impact of the fourth quarter share issuance, we are providing preliminary guidance for 2017 as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $14 to $16. This range assumes the full year effect of our 2016 new investments, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and each quarter thereafter and includes our model convention for share repurchase in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income.
As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017. The lower and of our guidance range includes a modest cash addition from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.  As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate consummation to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So I think first, would say that the Brexit vote -- the floor funding is really worthy uncertainty around it saw that show up more broadly through the month of June than just right after the also essentially that uncertainty running into it. We saw a few things sort of push out. That was the first. And then the second is that, as you say, within a have any closes in long lock capital partners, which is the underlying trend that we've been then of course, this is a tremendous company and the timing of the close on 1 or 2 fundings ends up -- can end up impacting that gross sales number versus number but really, I'd say just to follow on to your question is July was a good month and the institutional pipeline looks really strong. And partly that is probably because of some things that slipped from Q2 in the back half of the year but the RFP levels and the final's activity levels are really fantastic. And then maybe even the new ones there, which is that the description I gave of June was really on our funding not really on activity level because in, activity level for the quarter was actually quite good."

Maybe just to give you the backdrop of the last time we gave guidance -- the time we gave that guidance in the quarter, which was May 2, we were already up 1% and as you can see from our AUM table, we experienced about 1.3% market change for the full quarter, and I also note that FX impacted it by about 0.5% negative. So we really from the last time we gave guidance, markets really haven't changed materially. So it really was not market-related. And then when you look at what happened quarter-to-date, July, we effectively experienced about 2% up in our bland, which would be exactly consistent with what our quarter would expect. So there's really no change to our forward forecast with respect to be a because we got the 2% that I just described. So really, the 3 items are the quarter lag closed in July, Capula but we won't report until the fourth quarter, expect to close Winton in October but won't report until the first quarter of 2017, but we will have the revolver balance in that $2.5 million share issuance in this calendar year. And so that's the first bit. The second bit then would be our model convention given the pacing of new investments, the $1.3 billion  I mentioned earlier. We would from a guidance and a model perspective not assume any more share repurchases. So that has an impact. And then lastly, we've taken down our performance fee expectation just modestly, but that's the third piece here."

I guess I would say looking back over what we've  done over the last year and trying to imagine looking forward, I think there's probably a little more balance in the mix of little more traditional and perhaps a bit more U.S. base. But that's, I think, just the -- really just the incidental element of the pipeline and our relationship set. And not anything that I would call an enduring trend. I think because the overall opportunity is very much global and includes, of course, excellent alternative firms, as well as traditional loan only. So to your question about whether the recent volatility has done anything to impact the pipeline, I would say not really. I mean, I could maybe argue that to the extent that markets have recovered that the -- that there might be a greater inclination to move forward, but it's not anything we've seen from the discussions that were in the midst of and in terms of the forward part of the pipeline that continues to be positive with. I would say transactions that we've been working on as well as ones that were just at the earlier stages of them. And finally, with respect to your question about pricing, I would say for the best firms, it's -- you always have to pay fair prices. We, as you know, don't participate in auctions, don't try to put win auctions. And firms which choose to partner with AMG are making a much broader decision beyond just the valuation of the -- portion of the firm's revenues that were acquiring and in the short transaction. There are pockets of the industry, I would call out probably private equity firms where there's a lot of activity, and I would say a supply-demand balance among buyers and sellers, which is less favorable. But even there, we still find opportunities to invest in a sensible basis. And on an overall, it continues to be very much an execution of our new investment strategy in the same way that we've been doing it for 2 decades, building on relationships we've established and over years. And then making investments as a -- as a product of all the relationships and the description of our investment structure and how that fits with the prospective Affiliates' long-term succession plans."

So those things taken together, we want to make sure that we have the ability to execute on our new investment strategy as we obviously want to pick up the very best highest-quality boutique of Affiliates when they come to us. So that we have no interruption there. We obviously also want to keep our leverage at a reasonable level. So that's really the 2 main drivers as to why we chose or why we are choosing to issue 2.5 million shares later this year. It does preserve in both respects our ability to execute, and as we look forward, we expect to continue to execute. So really, it is in preparation and getting ready for the next wave of new investments."

It's a model convention to allow or illustrate the magnitude of the impact on our earnings from the use of the cash that the business generates. So how do we spend the $1 billion in EBITDA that the business generates is, of course a much more important and relevant question than it was 3 years ago, 5 years ago. We have a long track record of returning capital to shareholders when we see periods of relatively lower new investment opportunities. And over time, inevitably, as the business grows, there will be fewer and fewer periods where all of the cash or the largest part of the cash is used up by new investment opportunities. And so what we see going forward and in terms of the quality and pacing and magnitude of new investments is hard to gauge, as you've heard us say, we're -- we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects for adding outstanding new Affiliates, which will generate earnings accretion and broaden and diversify our product set and enhance our business and another way. So to the extent we have those opportunities, that will continue to be the primary focus of our capital activity. That said, inevitably, the pacing of new investment opportunities and again, over time, as the business grows -- sorry, the repurchase of shares will continue to be and over time maybe, I would say, even a more important element of our capital management. That part's philosophy and the commitment to return capital and not to just build cash on the balance sheet is also a part of our philosophy. But the amount and timing of repurchase relative to new investments is difficult to forecast, and I think if you look at our track record, we expect that we will continue to do both and do both in a meaningful way."

Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our",793,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. 
Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our pro forma assets, bringing our total assets under management to approximately $700 billion. Our Affiliates produced excellent relative investment performance and positive net client cash flows, and we added outstanding new Affiliates, including Winton Capital Management and Capula Investment Management. As Jay will describe, given the increased earnings power of our business, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth for the balance of the year and through 2017.
Notwithstanding elevated market volatility, which resulted in industry-wide risk aversion, we generated positive net client cash flows during the quarter. As Nate will discuss, our strong net inflows in the retail and high net worth channels were partially offset by lower institutional sales, especially at the end of the quarter, as a number of global institutional clients decided to pause implementation of investment decisions in response to the unexpected outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit referendum. 
We believe that this was essentially a short-term response, and looking ahead as markets have stabilized and investor expectations adjusted, we are seeing a resumption in sales momentum and expect to benefit from these delayed fundings through the balance of the year. We also believe that rising dispersion in the markets will increasingly favor differentiated performance-oriented strategies, including focused active equities in a range of value-added alternative investment products. 
Our Affiliates' equity strategies performed well in the quarter, including: Tweedy, Browne, Harding Loevner and Genesis, which all posted strong absolute and relative performance in global and emerging market equities; and Yacktman and TimesSquare, which in particular generated excellent results in U.S. equities. Our alternative managers also generally performed well amid the volatility, as several of our Affiliates, including AQR, First Quadrant and BlueMountain, generated meaningful alpha during the quarter.
Looking forward, contrary to conventional wisdom around challenges in the hedge fund industry, there is significant and growing client demand for alternative strategies across distribution channels, particularly those which are additive at a total portfolio level, given their lack of correlation to traditional equity and fixed income markets. We believe this is an enduring trend. The diversification and balanced risk and return offered by well-designed alternative strategies are compelling to both sophisticated global institutions as well as individual retail investors as they strive to meet their investment goals. 
We believe that clients are increasingly focusing on the highest-quality managers with long-term track records of alpha generation and those managers which have demonstrated that they can effectively manage at scale and with institutional quality. This trend benefits the highest-quality alternative firms, including our Affiliates, which are recognized as leaders in their respective disciplines. And as evidence of this, our alternative Affiliates have consistently generated positive net client cash flows over the past 5 years, including in the second quarter.
Across our group of Affiliates, we have strategically and deliberately assembled a very large and diverse set of alternative strategies, which taken as a whole, not only generates strong organic growth, but also have low correlation with equity markets and low correlation with each other. There's no other firm in the industry with the range and quality of our alternative product set. We think that this point is undervalued by the market and that the benefit of our strategic position across a very broad range of alternative strategies will become increasingly evident. Our substantial exposure to this array of strategies, which is in aggregate approximately 40% of our AUM, and the highly diversified return streams they provide is not only attractive in its own right but is also a strong complement to our strategic focus on differentiated active equities through our outstanding traditional Affiliates. As clients increasingly seek the highest-quality active managers for the alpha portions of their portfolios, our industry-leading boutique Affiliates are well-positioned for continued strong organic growth going forward.
Finally, turning to new investments. We continue to have an outstanding opportunity to further enhance the diversity of our performance-oriented product set by partnering with leading traditional and alternative firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for us, and we have a diverse global pipeline of prospective new Affiliates that are drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner for over 23 years.
Given our unmatched competitive position and our strong and flexible capital structure, we are confident in our ability to execute additional accretive investments in new Affiliates, and together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, are well-positioned for continued earnings growth ahead.
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates' results in more detail."

As Sean said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well, as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers. Let me begi",1607,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well, as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers. 
Let me begin with performance in the second quarter and start with our alternative products. Across our Affiliates, we are one of the largest managers of alternative products in the world with a very diverse portfolio of strategies across categories and investment styles. As Sean mentioned, the addition of a diverse series of high-quality alternative return streams to our outstanding equity boutiques significantly improves the stability of our business while also providing an enhanced long-term return profile. 
Now before I describe our performance in more detail, let me further break down our alternatives exposure into categories. And we now have these categories broken out in our IR presentation on our website. We have 4 primary groupings. 
First, private equity and real assets, which includes a variety of long-locked capital products, such as Pantheon's global private equity fund of funds and infrastructure fund, Baring Asia's emerging markets private equity strategies and EIG's energy and related infrastructure investments, none of which are impacted by short-term fluctuations in equity markets. 
The next category is systematic diversified strategies. These include our managed futures, or CTA, products at AQR, Systematica and Winton, which seek to deliver returns which are uncorrelated with equity markets and often substantially outperform in declining markets. 
The third category is fixed income and equity relative value strategies. Including those in BlueMountain and Capula, which look to provide returns uncorrelated to traditional equity and fixed income markets, as well as strategies with varying degrees of equity market exposure, from full exposure to market-neutral. 
Our fourth category is multi-asset and multi-strategy, which includes products that utilize a variety of asset classes and exposures to deliver diversifying return streams for both institutional and retail clients. 
Turning now to performance and starting with our private equity and real asset strategies, we have a very diverse array of offering with firms such as Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon. These firms have a number of current strategies where they are actively putting capital to work, and they have excellent long-term track records. 
Next, turning to our systematic diversified strategies. Our Affiliates include 3 of the leading CTA managers in the world, so we're benefiting not just from the diversity these strategies provide during periods of expanding volatility in trending markets but also from the excess return these firms have been able to provide pretty consistently over time.
With that as backdrop, our systematic diversified strategies were able to navigate the volatile market in the quarter well. AQR managed futures was one of the strongest performing strategies in the space with a positive return in the quarter and a strong long term track record. While Systematica's flagship BlueTrend fund losses in the quarter, it has positive returns for 2016 and a very strong long-term track record. Our investment in Winton has not closed yet, and so is reflected in the financial results for the quarter, but they also have one of the highest-quality offerings in this product category and performed well in the quarter. 
Among our fixed income and equity relative value strategies, BlueMountain and Capula generated positive returns in the quarter across most of their products, while ValueAct on the other hand, had a more challenging quarter, as they underperformed their benchmark, although they have started the third quarter very strong and continue to have an excellent long-term track record.
Finally, with regards to our multi-asset and multi-strategy offerings, many of our Affiliates' products performed well in the quarter, including risk parity products, both AQR and First Quadrant, as evidenced by the returns of their publicly available funds: AQR risk parity fund and AMG FQ global risk balanced, which were up 6% and 7% especially. In addition, we saw solid gains across other significant products in the category, such as AQR Style Premia and First Quadrant tactical currency. 
Now turning to our equity products and starting with the global developed markets category, where a number of our largest products and strategies posted strong absolute and relative returns. Tweedy, Browne's flagship global value fund outperformed its benchmark and peers in the quarter, further improving its long-term track record. Through the quarter, this fund held the top 5- and 10-year track records in Morningstar's foreign large value category. In addition, Harding Loevner once again outperformed benchmarks and peers both at international and global equity strategies. Both strategies also feature near or above top decile long-term track records in their respective Morningstar categories. On the other hand, AQR and Artemis underperformed their benchmarks, although they still maintained good long-term performance records in the major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Turning to our emerging markets category. We had very broad-based, strong relative performance. Almost all of our major products at the Affiliates, including AQR, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Trilogy, posted good absolute and relative returns. Standouts included Genesis global emerging markets and Harding Loevner emerging markets, each of which outpaced the benchmark by over 250 basis points.
Finally, with respect our U.S. equities, many of our U.S. growth strategies are biased towards quality growth and away from high beta stocks, and we benefited from that in the quarter as they generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers. This includes the largest products of Frontier and TimesSquare. On the U.S. value side, our largest U.S. equity contributor, Yacktman, saw their focused fund and diversified fund each outperform peers for the quarter, allowing them to maintain their top decile returns year-to-date and for the trailing year. And both funds still rank in the first percentile of their Morningstar category across the last 10- and 15-year periods.
Now turning to flows for the quarter. And I'll reiterate that flows to both the institutional end sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy. First, we were pleased to generate another quarter of positive net client cash flows of $630 million, bringing us to positive flows in 22 out of the last 24 quarters. Within our flows this quarter, there couple of themes to identify. 
First, as we've discussed on previous calls, we remain very well-positioned to participate in the trend of rising allocations to alternatives across distribution channels, and we benefited from this trend again this quarter. As Sean said, investors are increasingly using alternatives to achieve their investment objectives, either generate uncorrelated returns or for risk mitigation, and our Affiliates feature some of the best offerings in liquid and illiquid alternatives, whether for institutional, retail or high net worth investments. While there have been a lot of headlines about the challenges so-called hedge funds are facing, we shall be very careful to separate those from the strong underlying trend of flows to alternatives more broadly, a trend we believe will continue and which we are very well-positioned to participate in. 
Second, the quarter was really a tale of 2 parts, with a relatively good first 2 months giving way to June, which was impacted significantly by the Brexit vote and the volatility around it. 
Now moving to specifics for the quarter and starting with the institutional channel, we had net outflows of $2.9 billion in the quarter. There were 3 broad reasons for the negative net flows in the channel. First, we saw the funding process for several significant mandates flow in the back half of the quarter. A couple of cases were explicitly linked to Brexit-related uncertainty. Second, we did experience some outflows from petrodollar-related clients. And third, unusually, we did not have any meaningful closes in our long-locked capital products at firms, such as Pantheon, EIG and Baring Asia, that was really just an idiosyncratic dynamic related to the quarter. There is significant demand for these illiquid products. It was a matter of incidental timing in how the fund-raising cycles across Affiliates stacked up.
Turning to the high net worth channel. We had record inflows of $1.7 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were SMAs sold through our broker-dealer channel, especially in municipal bonds, as well as our AMG Wealth Partners platform, where we continue to see good traction developing. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. From an asset class perspective, flows this quarter were driven by strong inflows for alternatives and emerging market equities offerings, and we continue to benefit from the much better U.S. equity redemption rates. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to net positive flows were AQR and Harding Loevner. We did have some elevated retail outflows at our U.K. Affiliate, Artemis, in the second half of the quarter, particularly in our U.K.-oriented strategies following the Brexit vote. But as markets recover, we expect this to continue to debate.
More broadly, while there is still a lot to be determined regarding the outcome, we do not see the Brexit vote having a significant direct impact on our distribution efforts our Affiliates' operations more broadly. In fact, in the area most likely to be impacted, the retail channel across the U.K. and Europe, our Affiliate product offerings, even from our U.K.-based Affiliates, are mostly domiciled outside of the U.K. and should be relatively unaffected; or domiciled in the U.K. but also sold to U.K. clients. 
Looking ahead, with our outstanding and growing array of high-quality equity and alternative products along with our unique distribution strategy, which includes both the Affiliates and distribution teams, as well as AMG's focused, complementary resources, we believe we are very well-positioned for meaningful organic growth ahead.
With that, let me turn to Jay to discuss the financials."
24445,377731153,1020216,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in a quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has a differentiated ability to produce stable earnings across a range of market environments, and with the addition of Winton and Capul",961,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in a quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has a differentiated ability to produce stable earnings across a range of market environments, and with the addition of Winton and Capula, we will further diversify and increase the earnings power of our business. 
As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.06 for the second quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.10. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.97.
Turning to more specific modeling items. For the second quarter, our EBITDA was $220.3 million and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.6 basis points or approximately 13.1 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to decline to approximately 13.1 basis points, reflecting lower performance fees, which is typical in a third quarter. 
As a reminder, we will report our recent new investments on a 1-quarter lag. As a result, this will have the effect of lowering our earnings for the second half of 2016 but not thereafter, as we closed Capula in July and we expect to close Winton in the fourth quarter without reporting their respective income in the quarter in which we closed. I will further describe the timing and cost of funding of these new investments in a moment.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% and our cash tax rate was 18.8%. In the third quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the second quarter were 23 point -- $21.3 million. We expect this number to remain at approximately $21 million in the third quarter. And for the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $87 million. 
Our share reported amortization for the second quarter was $37 million, which includes $14.8 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the third quarter, we expect our share of amortization to decline to approximately $35 million. And for the full year 2016, we expect amortization to be approximately $145 million. 
Our share of interest expense for the second quarter was $21.9 million. In the third quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to be approximately $24 million, reflecting the higher revolver balance from the closing of Capula. For the full year 2016, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $90 million. 
Other economic items for the second quarter was $0.8 million. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. In June, we announced new investments for the total purchase price of $800 million and simultaneously entered into a forward equity contract for up to 2.9 million shares, a structure which we have used several times in the past. Of the available 2.9 million shares, we expect to issue 2.5 million shares for $400 million in proceeds in the fourth quarter upon closing Winton, with the remainder of the purchase price funded under our revolver. 
Given this funding profile as well as the ongoing strength of our balance sheet and the quality and diversity of our business, we were placed on positive outlook by S&P.
With our flexible capital structure, we are well-positioned for growth in a range of market environments, and looking ahead, the strength and scale of our business which generates run rate EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available by year end under our revolver, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance. We are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.30 to $13.30. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through Friday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth for the fourth quarter. As product invention, given the pacing of our 2016 new investments, our guidance does not assume incremental share repurchases for the balance of 2016. We expect our weighted average share count for 2016 to be approximately 55 million, which includes the expected equity issuance in the fourth quarter.
Given the meaningful run rate impact of our recent new investments which is not reflected in 2016, as well as a full year impact of the fourth quarter share issuance, we are providing preliminary guidance for 2017, as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $14 to $16. This range assumes the full year effect of our 2016 new investments, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and each quarter thereafter and includes our model convention for share repurchase in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017. 
The lower ends of our guidance ranges includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper ends assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So I think first, would say that the Brexit vote, the flow of funding is really where the uncertainty around it. So we actually saw that show up more broadly through the month of June than just right after the vote. So there's actually that uncertainty running into it, we saw a few things sort of push out. That was the first. And then the second is as you say, we didn't have any closes in long-locked capital products, which is the other underlying sort of trend I'd give you. And then yes, of course as you say, it is always lumpy. And so the timing of the close on 1 or 2 fundings ends up -- can end up impacting that gross sales number. But really, I'd say just to follow on to your question is, look, July was a good month and the institutional pipeline looks really strong. And partly, that is probably because of some things that slipped from Q2 in the back half of the year, but the RFP levels and the finals -- activity levels are really fantastic.

But as you say, it will be lumpy. But those are all very significant things. I do want to be clear, we did have some additional pieces in, but there was nothing that was sort of a meaningful close on long-lock, which again, if you look across the breadth and diversity of that product set across the Affiliates we sort of talked about, it's quite unusual to not have anything. But again, as I sad, it was just the accident of how things stacked up. And then I think our petrodollar, kind of the exposures, still one of the lowest, I think, in the industry, frankly.

Maybe just to give you the backdrop of the last time we gave guidance -- or the time we gave that guidance in the quarter, which was May 2, we were already up about 1%. And as you can see from our AUM table, we experienced about 1.3% market change for the full quarter, and I also note that FX impacted it by about 0.5%, negative. So we really -- from the last time we gave guidance, markets really haven't changed materially, so it really was not market-related. And then when you look at what happened quarter-to-date July, we've effectively experienced about 2% up in our blend, which would be exactly consistent with what the quarter would expect. So there's really no change to our forward forecast with respect to beta because we got the 2% that I just described. So really, the 3 items are the quarter lag. Closed in July, Capula, but we won't report until the fourth quarter. Expect to close Winton in October, but won't report till the first quarter of 2017. But we will have the revolver balance and the 2.5 million share issuance in this calendar year. And so that's the first bit. The second bit then would be our model convention, given the pacing of new investments, the $1.3 billion I mentioned earlier. We would, from a guidance and a model perspective, not assume any more share repurchases. So that has an impact. And then lastly, we've taken down our performance fee expectation just modestly, but that's the third piece here."

And so the retirement piece of our business is modest. It's actually, frankly, an area where we should be able to grow our business and there should be real opportunities for us there over time. That said, right, there are definitely going to be ways that the rules are impacting the way products are sold by an intermediary [ph] that work with, and that is where most of our retirement business is. And so we're probably thinking about this same way many others are from that perspective, which is, okay, what are the things we can be doing to be a supportive partner as we're sort of working through as they're working through primarily, but as they are working through this. So again, not a particularly large piece of our business, the places that we're interacting directly already with retirement investors, we're already fiduciaries, 100% of the business.

As you heard us say in the prepared remarks, generally speaking, the new investment pipeline continues to be strong. I guess I would say, looking back over what we've done over the last year and trying to imagine looking forward, I think there's probably a little more balance in the mix of little more traditional and perhaps a bit more U.S. based. But that's, I think, just the -- really just the incidental element of the pipeline and our relationship set and not anything that I would call an enduring trend. I think because the overall opportunity is very much global and includes, of course, excellent alternative firms as well as traditional long-only. So to your question about whether the recent volatility has done anything to impact the pipeline, I would say not really. I mean, I could maybe argue that to the extent that markets have recovered, that the -- that there might be a greater inclination to move forward, but it's not anything we've seen from the discussions that were in the midst of. And in terms of the forward part of the pipeline, that continues to be positive with, I would say, transactions that we've been working on, as well as ones that we're just at the earlier stages of. And finally, with respect to your question about pricing, I would say for the best firms, it's -- you always have to pay fair prices. We, as you know, don't participate in auctions, don't try to ""win"" auctions. And firms which choose to partner with AMG are making a much broader decision beyond just the valuation of the -- portion of the firm's revenues that we're acquiring in the initial transaction. There are pockets of the industry, I would call out probably private equity firms, where there's a lot of activity and I would say a supply-demand balance among buyers and sellers which is less favorable. But even there, we still find opportunities to invest in a sensible basis. And on an overall, it continues to be very much an execution of our new investment strategy in the same way that we've been doing it for 2 decades, building on relationships that we've established in -- over years, and then making investments as a -- as a product of all the relationships, and the description of our investment structure and how that fits with the prospective Affiliates' long-term succession plans."

I think the third consideration is our leverage ratio of debt-to-EBITDA is just above 2x now, call it 2.1. So those things taken together, we want to make sure that we have the ability to execute on our new investment strategy as we obviously want to pick up the very best, highest-quality boutique of Affiliates when they come to us so that we have no interruption there. We obviously also want to keep our leverage at a reasonable level. So that's really the 2 main drivers as to why we chose or why we are choosing to issue 2.5 million shares later this year. It does preserve, in both respects, our ability to execute and as we look forward, we expect to continue to execute. So really, it is in preparation and getting ready for the next wave of new investments."

So how do we spend the $1 billion in EBITDA that the business generates is, of course, a much more important and relevant question than it was 3 years ago, 5 years ago. We have a long track record of returning capital to shareholders when we see periods of relatively lower new investment opportunities. And over time, inevitably, as the business grows, there will be fewer and fewer periods where all of the cash, or the largest part of the cash, is used up by new investment opportunities. And so what we see going forward and in terms of the quality and pacing and magnitude of new investments is hard to gauge. As you've heard us say, we're -- we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects for adding outstanding new Affiliates which will generate earnings accretion and broaden and diversify our product set and enhance our business in other ways. So to the extent we have those opportunities, that will continue to be the primary focus of our capital activity. That said, inevitably, the pacing of new investment opportunities, and again over time, as the business grows, new and -- sorry, the repurchase of shares will continue to be, and over time maybe I would say, even be a more important element of our capital management. That part's philosophy. And the commitment to return capital and not to just build cash on the balance sheet is also a part of our philosophy. But the amount and timing of repurchase relative to new investments is difficult to forecast. And I think if you look at our track record, we expect that we will continue to do both and do both in a meaningful way."

Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our",799,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. 
Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our pro forma assets, bringing our total assets under management to approximately $700 billion. Our Affiliates produced excellent relative investment performance and positive net client cash flows, and we added outstanding new Affiliates, including Winton Capital Management (sic) [ Winton Capital Group ] and Capula Investment Management. As Jay will describe, given the increased earnings power of our business, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth for the balance of the year and through 2017.
Notwithstanding elevated market volatility, which resulted in industry-wide risk aversion, we generated positive net client cash flows during the quarter. As Nate will discuss, our strong net inflows in the retail and high net worth channels were partially offset by lower institutional sales, especially at the end of the quarter, as a number of global institutional clients decided to pause implementation of investment decisions in response to the unexpected outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit referendum. 
We believe that this was essentially a short-term response, and looking ahead as markets have stabilized and investor expectations adjusted, we are seeing a resumption in sales momentum and expect to benefit from these delayed fundings through the balance of the year. We also believe that rising dispersion in the markets will increasingly favor differentiated performance-oriented strategies, including focused active equities and a range of value-added alternative investment products. 
Our Affiliates' equity strategies performed well in the quarter, including: Tweedy, Browne; Harding Loevner; and Genesis, which all posted strong absolute and relative performance in global and emerging market equities; and Yacktman and TimesSquare, which in particular generated excellent results in U.S. equities. Our alternative managers also generally performed well amid the volatility, as several of our Affiliates, including AQR, First Quadrant and BlueMountain, generated meaningful alpha during the quarter.
Looking forward, contrary to conventional wisdom around challenges in the hedge fund industry, there is significant and growing client demand for alternative strategies across distribution channels, particularly those which are additive at a total portfolio level, given their lack of correlation to traditional equity and fixed income markets. We believe this is an enduring trend. The diversification and balanced risk and return offered by well-designed alternative strategies are compelling to both sophisticated global institutions as well as individual retail investors as they strive to meet their investment goals. 
We believe that clients are increasingly focusing on the highest-quality managers with long-term track records of alpha generation and those managers which have demonstrated that they can effectively manage at scale and with institutional quality. This trend benefits the highest-quality alternative firms, including our Affiliates, which are recognized as leaders in their respective disciplines. And as evidence of this, our alternative Affiliates have consistently generated positive net client cash flows over the past 5 years, including in the second quarter.
Across our group of Affiliates, we have strategically and deliberately assembled a very large and diverse set of alternative strategies, which taken as a whole, not only generates strong organic growth, but also have low correlation with equity markets and low correlation with each other. There's no other firm in the industry with the range and quality of our alternative product set. We think that this point is undervalued by the market and that the benefit of our strategic position across a very broad range of alternative strategies will become increasingly evident. Our substantial exposure to this array of strategies, which is in aggregate approximately 40% of our AUM, and the highly diversified return streams they provide is not only attractive in its own right but is also a strong complement to our strategic focus on differentiated active equities through our outstanding traditional Affiliates. As clients increasingly seek the highest-quality active managers for the alpha portions of their portfolios, our industry-leading boutique Affiliates are well-positioned for continued strong organic growth going forward.
Finally, turning to new investments. We continue to have an outstanding opportunity to further enhance the diversity of our performance-oriented product set by partnering with leading traditional and alternative firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for us, and we have a diverse global pipeline of prospective new Affiliates that are drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner for over 23 years.
Given our unmatched competitive position and our strong and flexible capital structure, we are confident in our ability to execute additional accretive investments in new Affiliates, and together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, are well-positioned for continued earnings growth ahead.
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates' results in more detail."

As Sean said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well, as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers. Let me begi",1615,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well, as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers. 
Let me begin with performance in the second quarter and start with our alternative products. Across our Affiliates, we are one of the largest managers of alternative products in the world with a very diverse portfolio of strategies across categories and investment styles. As Sean mentioned, the addition of a diverse series of high-quality alternative return streams to our outstanding equity boutiques significantly improves the stability of our business while also providing an enhanced long-term return profile. 
Now before I describe our performance in more detail, let me further break down our alternatives exposure into categories. And we now have these categories broken out in our IR presentation on our website. We have 4 primary groupings. 
First, private equity and real assets, which includes a variety of long-locked capital products, such as Pantheon's global private equity fund of funds and infrastructure fund, Baring Asia's emerging markets private equity strategies and EIG's energy and related infrastructure investments, none of which are impacted by short-term fluctuations in equity markets. 
The next category is systematic diversified strategies. These include our managed futures, or CTA, products at AQR, Systematica and Winton, which seek to deliver returns which are uncorrelated with equity markets and often substantially outperform in declining markets. 
The third category is fixed income and equity relative value strategies, including those in BlueMountain and Capula, which look to provide returns uncorrelated to traditional equity and fixed income markets, as well as strategies with varying degrees of equity market exposure, from full exposure to market-neutral. 
Our fourth category is multi-asset and multi-strategy, which includes products that utilize a variety of asset classes and exposures to deliver diversifying return streams for both institutional and retail clients. 
Turning now to performance and starting with our private equity and real asset strategies, we have a very diverse array of offering with firms such as Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon. These firms have a number of current strategies where they are actively putting capital to work, and they have excellent long-term track records. 
Next, turning to our systematic diversified strategies. Our Affiliates include 3 of the leading CTA managers in the world, so we're benefiting not just from the diversity these strategies provide during periods of expanding volatility in trending markets but also from the excess return these firms have been able to provide pretty consistently over time.
With that as backdrop, our systematic diversified strategies were able to navigate the volatile market in the quarter well. AQR managed futures was one of the strongest performing strategies in the space with a positive return in the quarter and a strong long-term track record. While Systematica's flagship BlueTrend fund posted losses in the quarter, it has positive returns for 2016 and a very strong long-term track record. Our investment in Winton has not closed yet, and so is not reflected in the financial results for the quarter, but they also have one of the highest-quality offerings in this product category and performed well in the quarter. 
Among our fixed income and equity relative value strategies, BlueMountain and Capula generated positive returns in the quarter across most of their products, while ValueAct on the other hand, had a more challenging quarter, as they underperformed their benchmark, although they have started the third quarter very strong and continue to have an excellent long-term track record.
Finally, with regards to our multi-asset and multi-strategy offerings, many of our Affiliates' products performed well in the quarter, including risk parity products, both AQR and First Quadrant, as evidenced by the returns of their publicly available funds: AQR risk parity fund and AMG FQ global risk balanced, which were up 6% and 7%, respectively. In addition, we saw solid gains across other significant products in the category, such as AQR Style Premia and First Quadrant tactical currency. 
Now turning to our equity products and starting with the global developed markets category, where a number of our largest products and strategies posted strong absolute and relative returns. Tweedy, Browne's flagship global value fund outperformed its benchmark and peers in the quarter, further improving its long-term track record. Through the quarter, this fund held the top 5- and 10-year track records in Morningstar's foreign large value category. In addition, Harding Loevner once again outperformed benchmarks and peers both at international and global equity strategies. Both strategies also feature near or above top decile long-term track records in their respective Morningstar categories. On the other hand, AQR and Artemis underperformed their benchmarks, although they still maintained good long-term performance records in the major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Turning to our emerging markets category. We had very broad-based, strong relative performance. Almost all of our major products at the Affiliates, including AQR, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Trilogy, posted good absolute and relative returns. Standouts included Genesis global emerging markets and Harding Loevner emerging markets, each of which outpaced the benchmark by over 250 basis points.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, many of our U.S. growth strategies are biased towards quality growth and away from high beta stocks, and we benefited from that in the quarter as they generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers. This includes the largest products of Frontier and TimesSquare. On the U.S. value side, our largest U.S. equity contributor, Yacktman, saw their focused fund and diversified fund each outperform peers for the quarter, allowing them to maintain their top decile returns year-to-date and for the trailing year. And both funds still rank in the first percentile of their Morningstar category across the last 10- and 15-year periods.
Now turning to flows for the quarter. And I'll reiterate that flows to both the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy. First, we were pleased to generate another quarter of positive net client cash flows of $630 million, bringing us to positive flows in 22 out of the last 24 quarters. Within our flows this quarter, there are a couple of themes to identify. 
First, as we've discussed on previous calls, we remain very well-positioned to participate in the trend of rising allocations to alternatives across distribution channels, and we benefited from this trend again this quarter. As Sean said, investors are increasingly using alternatives to achieve their investment objectives, either to generate uncorrelated returns or for risk mitigation, and our Affiliates feature some of the best offerings in liquid and illiquid alternatives, whether for institutional, retail or high net worth investors. While there have been a lot of headlines about the challenges so-called hedge funds are facing, we should all be very careful to separate those from the strong underlying trend of flows to alternatives more broadly, a trend we believe will continue and which we are very well-positioned to participate in. 
Second, the quarter was really a tale of 2 parts, with a relatively good first 2 months giving way to June, which was impacted significantly by the Brexit vote and the volatility around it. 
Now moving to specifics for the quarter and starting with the institutional channel, we had net outflows of $2.9 billion in the quarter. There were 3 broad reasons for the negative net flows in the channel. First, we saw the funding process for several significant mandates slow in the back half of the quarter. A couple of cases were explicitly linked to Brexit-related uncertainty. Second, we did experience some outflows from petrodollar-related clients. And third, unusually, we did not have any meaningful closes in our long-locked capital products at firms such as Pantheon, EIG and Baring Asia, that was really just an idiosyncratic dynamic related to the quarter. There is significant demand for these illiquid products. So it is a matter of incidental timing in how the fund-raising cycles across Affiliates stacked up.
Turning to the high net worth channel. We had record inflows of $1.7 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were SMAs sold through our broker-dealer channel, especially in municipal bonds, as well as our AMG Wealth Partners platform, where we continue to see good traction developing. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. From an asset class perspective, flows this quarter were driven by strong inflows for alternatives and emerging market equities offerings, and we continue to benefit from the much better U.S. equity redemption rates. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to net positive flows were AQR and Harding Loevner. We did have some elevated retail outflows at our U.K. Affiliate, Artemis, in the second half of the quarter, particularly in our U.K.-oriented strategies following the Brexit vote. But as markets recover, we expect this to continue to abate.
More broadly, while there is still a lot to be determined regarding the outcome, we do not see the Brexit vote having a significant direct impact on our distribution efforts or our Affiliates' operations more broadly. In fact, in the area most likely to be impacted, the retail channel across the U.K. and Europe, our Affiliate product offerings, even from our U.K.-based Affiliates, are mostly domiciled outside of the U.K. and should be relatively unaffected; or domiciled in the U.K. but also sold to U.K. clients. 
Looking ahead, with our outstanding and growing array of high-quality equity and alternative products along with our unique distribution strategy, which includes both the Affiliates and distribution teams, as well as AMG's focused, complementary resources, we believe we are very well-positioned for meaningful organic growth ahead.
With that, let me turn to Jay to discuss the financials."
24445,377731153,1020481,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in a quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has a differentiated ability to produce stable earnings across a range of market environments, and with the addition of Winton and Capul",962,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in a quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has a differentiated ability to produce stable earnings across a range of market environments, and with the addition of Winton and Capula, we will further diversify and increase the earnings power of our business. 
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.06 for the second quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.10. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.97.
Turning to more specific modeling items. For the second quarter, our EBITDA was $220.3 million and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.6 basis points or approximately 13.1 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to decline to approximately 13.1 basis points, reflecting lower performance fees, which is typical in a third quarter. 
As a reminder, we will report our recent new investments on a 1-quarter lag. As a result, this will have the effect of lowering our earnings for the second half of 2016 but not thereafter, as we closed Capula in July and we expect to close Winton in the fourth quarter without reporting their respective income in the quarter in which we closed. I will further describe the timing and cost of funding of these new investments in a moment.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% and our cash tax rate was 18.8%. In the third quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the second quarter were 23 point -- $21.3 million. We expect this number to remain at approximately $21 million in the third quarter. And for the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $87 million. 
Our share reported amortization for the second quarter was $37 million, which includes $14.8 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the third quarter, we expect our share of amortization to decline to approximately $35 million. And for the full year 2016, we expect amortization to be approximately $145 million. 
Our share of interest expense for the second quarter was $21.9 million. In the third quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to be approximately $24 million, reflecting the higher revolver balance from the closing of Capula. For the full year 2016, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $90 million. 
Other economic items for the second quarter were $0.8 million. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. In June, we announced new investments for the total purchase price of $800 million and simultaneously entered into a forward equity contract for up to 2.9 million shares, a structure which we have used several times in the past. Of the available 2.9 million shares, we expect to issue 2.5 million shares for $400 million in proceeds in the fourth quarter upon closing Winton, with the remainder of the purchase price funded under our revolver. 
Given this funding profile as well as the ongoing strength of our balance sheet and the quality and diversity of our business, we were placed on positive outlook by S&P.
With our flexible capital structure, we are well-positioned for growth in a range of market environments, and looking ahead, the strength and scale of our business which generates run rate EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available by year-end under our revolver, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance. We are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.30 to $13.30. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through Friday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth for the fourth quarter. As per our convention, given the pacing of our 2016 new investments, our guidance does not assume incremental share repurchases for the balance of 2016. We expect our weighted average share count for 2016 to be approximately 55 million, which includes the expected equity issuance in the fourth quarter.
Given the meaningful run rate impact of our recent new investments which is not reflected in 2016, as well as a full year impact of the fourth quarter share issuance, we are providing preliminary guidance for 2017, as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $14 to $16. This range assumes the full year effect of our 2016 new investments, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and each quarter thereafter, and includes our normal model convention for share repurchase in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017. 
The lower ends of our guidance ranges includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper ends assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So I think first, I would say that the Brexit vote, the slowed fundings really where the uncertainty around it. So we actually saw that show up more broadly through the month of June than just right after the vote. So there's actually that uncertainty running into it, we saw a few things sort of push out. That was the first. And then the second is as you say, we didn't have any closes in long-locked capital products, which is the other underlying sort of trend I'd give you.

And partly, that is probably because of some things that slipped from Q2 into the back half of the year, but the RFP levels and the finals -- activity levels are really fantastic. And so maybe even a nuance there, which is that description I gave of June was really on funding, not really on activity level. Because again, activity level through the quarter was actually quite good."

But as you say, it will be lumpy. But those are all very significant things. I do want to be clear, we did have some additional pieces in, but there was nothing that was sort of a meaningful close on long-lock, which again, if you look across the breadth and diversity of that product set across the Affiliates we sort of talked about, it's quite unusual to not have anything. But again, as I said, it was just the accident of how things stacked up. And then I think our petrodollar, kind of the exposures, still one of the lowest, I think, in the industry, frankly.

Maybe just to give you the backdrop of the last time we gave guidance -- at the time we gave that guidance in the quarter, which was May 2, we were already up about 1%. And as you can see from our AUM table, we experienced about 1.3% market change for the full quarter, and I also note that FX impacted it by about 0.5% negative. So we really -- from the last time we gave guidance, markets really haven't changed materially, so it really was not market-related. And then when you look at what happened quarter-to-date July, we've effectively experienced about 2% up in our blend, which would be exactly consistent with what the quarter would expect. So there's really no change to our forward forecast with respect to beta because we got the 2% that I just described. So really, the 3 items are the quarter lag. Closed in July, Capula, but we won't report until the fourth quarter. Expect to close Winton in October, but won't report till the first quarter of 2017. But we will have the revolver balance and the 2.5 million share issuance in this calendar year. And so that's the first bit. The second bit then would be our model convention, given the pacing of new investments, the $1.3 billion I mentioned earlier. We would, from a guidance and a model perspective, not assume any more share repurchases. So that has an impact. And then lastly, we've taken down our performance fee expectation just modestly, but that's the third piece here."

And so the retirement piece of our business is modest. It's actually, frankly, an area where we should be able to grow our business and there should be real opportunities for us there over time. That said, right, there are definitely going to be ways that the rules are impacting the way products are sold by intermediaries we work with, and that is where most of our retirement business is. And so we're probably thinking about this same way many others are from that perspective, which is, okay, what are the things we can be doing to be a supportive partner as we're sort of working through as they're working through primarily, but as they are working through this. So again, not a particularly large piece of our business, the places that we're interacting directly already with retirement investors, we're already fiduciaries, it's 100% of our business.

As you heard us say in the prepared remarks, generally speaking, the new investment pipeline continues to be strong. I guess I would say, looking back over what we've done over the last year and trying to imagine looking forward, I think there's probably a little more balance in the mix, a little more traditional and perhaps a bit more U.S. based. But that's, I think, just the -- really just the incidental element of the pipeline and our relationship set and not anything that I would call an enduring trend. I think because the overall opportunity is very much global and includes, of course, excellent alternative firms as well as traditional long-only. So to your question about whether the recent volatility has done anything to impact the pipeline, I would say not really. I mean, I could maybe argue that to the extent that markets have recovered, that the -- that there might be a greater inclination to move forward, but it's not anything we've seen from the discussions that we're in the midst of. And in terms of the forward part of the pipeline, that continues to be positive with, I would say, transactions that we've been working on, as well as ones that we're just at the earlier stages of. And finally, with respect to your question about pricing, I would say for the best firms, it's -- you always have to pay fair prices. We, as you know, don't participate in auctions, don't try to ""win"" auctions. And firms which choose to partner with AMG are making a much broader decision beyond just the valuation of the -- portion of the firm's revenues that we're acquiring in the initial transaction. There are pockets of the industry, I would call out probably private equity firms, where there's a lot of activity and I would say a supply-demand balance among buyers and sellers which is less favorable. But even there, we still find opportunities to invest in a sensible basis. And on an overall, it continues to be very much an execution of our new investment strategy in the same way that we've been doing it for 2 decades, building on relationships that we've established in -- over years, and then making investments as a -- as a product of all the relationships, and the description of our investment structure and how that fits with the prospective Affiliates' long-term succession plans."

We obviously also want to keep our leverage at a reasonable level. So that's really the 2 main drivers as to why we chose or why we are choosing to issue 2.5 million shares later this year.

So how do we spend the $1 billion in EBITDA that the business generates is, of course, a much more important and relevant question than it was 3 years ago, 5 years ago. We have a long track record of returning capital to shareholders when we see periods of relatively lower new investment opportunities. And over time, inevitably, as the business grows, there will be fewer and fewer periods where all of the cash, or the largest part of the cash, is used up by new investment opportunities. And so what we see going forward and in terms of the quality and pacing and magnitude of new investments is hard to gauge. As you've heard us say, we're -- we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects for adding outstanding new Affiliates which will generate earnings accretion and broaden and diversify our product set and enhance our business in other ways. So to the extent we have those opportunities, that will continue to be the primary focus of our capital activity. That said, inevitably, the pacing of new investment opportunities, and again over time, as the business grows, new and -- sorry, the repurchase of shares will continue to be, and over time maybe I would say, even be a more important element of our capital management. That part's philosophy. And the commitment to return capital and not to just build cash on the balance sheet is also a part of our philosophy. But the amount and timing of repurchase relative to new investments is difficult to forecast. And I think if you look at our track record, we expect that we will continue to do both and do both in a meaningful way."

Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our",799,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. 
Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our pro forma assets, bringing our total assets under management to approximately $700 billion. Our Affiliates produced excellent relative investment performance and positive net client cash flows, and we added outstanding new Affiliates, including Winton Capital Management (sic) [ Winton Capital Group ] and Capula Investment Management. As Jay will describe, given the increased earnings power of our business, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth for the balance of the year and through 2017.
Notwithstanding elevated market volatility, which resulted in industry-wide risk aversion, we generated positive net client cash flows during the quarter. As Nate will discuss, our strong net inflows in the retail and high net worth channels were partially offset by lower institutional sales, especially at the end of the quarter, as a number of global institutional clients decided to pause implementation of investment decisions in response to the unexpected outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit referendum. 
We believe that this was essentially a short-term response, and looking ahead as markets have stabilized and investor expectations adjusted, we are seeing a resumption in sales momentum and expect to benefit from these delayed fundings through the balance of the year. We also believe that rising dispersion in the markets will increasingly favor differentiated performance-oriented strategies, including focused active equities and a range of value-added alternative investment products. 
Our Affiliates' equity strategies performed well in the quarter, including: Tweedy, Browne; Harding Loevner; and Genesis, which all posted strong absolute and relative performance in global and emerging market equities; and Yacktman and TimesSquare, which in particular generated excellent results in U.S. equities. Our alternative managers also generally performed well amid the volatility, as several of our Affiliates, including AQR, First Quadrant and BlueMountain, generated meaningful alpha during the quarter.
Looking forward, contrary to conventional wisdom around challenges in the hedge fund industry, there is significant and growing client demand for alternative strategies across distribution channels, particularly those which are additive at a total portfolio level, given their lack of correlation to traditional equity and fixed income markets. We believe this is an enduring trend. The diversification and balanced risk and return offered by well-designed alternative strategies are compelling to both sophisticated global institutions as well as individual retail investors as they strive to meet their investment goals. 
We believe that clients are increasingly focusing on the highest-quality managers with long-term track records of alpha generation and those managers which have demonstrated that they can effectively manage at scale and with institutional quality. This trend benefits the highest-quality alternative firms, including our Affiliates, which are recognized as leaders in their respective disciplines. And as evidence of this, our alternative Affiliates have consistently generated positive net client cash flows over the past 5 years, including in the second quarter.
Across our group of Affiliates, we have strategically and deliberately assembled a very large and diverse set of alternative strategies, which taken as a whole, not only generates strong organic growth, but also have low correlation with equity markets and low correlation with each other. There's no other firm in the industry with the range and quality of our alternative product set. We think that this point is undervalued by the market and that the benefit of our strategic position across a very broad range of alternative strategies will become increasingly evident. Our substantial exposure to this array of strategies, which is in aggregate approximately 40% of our AUM, and the highly diversified return streams they provide is not only attractive in its own right but is also a strong complement to our strategic focus on differentiated active equities through our outstanding traditional Affiliates. As clients increasingly seek the highest-quality active managers for the alpha portions of their portfolios, our industry-leading boutique Affiliates are well-positioned for continued strong organic growth going forward.
Finally, turning to new investments. We continue to have an outstanding opportunity to further enhance the diversity of our performance-oriented product set by partnering with leading traditional and alternative firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for us, and we have a diverse global pipeline of prospective new Affiliates that are drawn to AMG's excellent reputation as a partner for over 23 years.
Given our unmatched competitive position and our strong and flexible capital structure, we are confident in our ability to execute additional accretive investments in new Affiliates, and together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, are well-positioned for continued earnings growth ahead.
With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates' results in more detail."

As Sean said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well, as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers. Let me begi",1615,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we had positive net flows and our business performed well, as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers. 
Let me begin with performance in the second quarter and start with our alternative products. Across our Affiliates, we are one of the largest managers of alternative products in the world with a very diverse portfolio of strategies across categories and investment styles. As Sean mentioned, the addition of a diverse series of high-quality alternative return streams to our outstanding equity boutiques significantly improves the stability of our business while also providing an enhanced long-term return profile. 
Now before I describe our performance in more detail, let me further break down our alternatives exposure into categories. And we now have these categories broken out in our IR presentation on our website. We have 4 primary groupings. 
First, private equity and real assets, which includes a variety of long-locked capital products, such as Pantheon's global private equity fund of funds and infrastructure fund, Baring Asia's emerging markets private equity strategies and EIG's energy and related infrastructure investments, none of which are impacted by short-term fluctuations in equity markets. 
The next category is systematic diversified strategies. These include our managed futures, or CTA, products at AQR, Systematica and Winton, which seek to deliver returns which are uncorrelated with equity markets and often substantially outperform in declining markets. 
The third category is fixed income and equity relative value strategies, including those in BlueMountain and Capula, which look to provide returns uncorrelated to traditional equity and fixed income markets, as well as strategies with varying degrees of equity market exposure, from full exposure to market-neutral. 
Our fourth category is multi-asset and multi-strategy, which includes products that utilize a variety of asset classes and exposures to deliver diversifying return streams for both institutional and retail clients. 
Turning now to performance and starting with our private equity and real asset strategies, we have a very diverse array of offering with firms such as Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon. These firms have a number of current strategies where they are actively putting capital to work, and they have excellent long-term track records. 
Next, turning to our systematic diversified strategies. Our Affiliates include 3 of the leading CTA managers in the world, so we're benefiting not just from the diversity these strategies provide during periods of expanding volatility in trending markets but also from the excess return these firms have been able to provide pretty consistently over time.
With that as backdrop, our systematic diversified strategies were able to navigate the volatile market in the quarter well. AQR managed futures was one of the strongest performing strategies in the space with a positive return in the quarter and a strong long-term track record. While Systematica's flagship BlueTrend fund posted losses in the quarter, it has positive returns for 2016 and a very strong long-term track record. Our investment in Winton has not closed yet, and so is not reflected in the financial results for the quarter, but they also have one of the highest-quality offerings in this product category and performed well in the quarter. 
Among our fixed income and equity relative value strategies, BlueMountain and Capula generated positive returns in the quarter across most of their products, while ValueAct on the other hand, had a more challenging quarter, as they underperformed their benchmark, although they have started the third quarter very strong and continue to have an excellent long-term track record.
Finally, with regards to our multi-asset and multi-strategy offerings, many of our Affiliates' products performed well in the quarter, including risk parity products, both AQR and First Quadrant, as evidenced by the returns of their publicly available funds: AQR risk parity fund and AMG FQ global risk balanced, which were up 6% and 7%, respectively. In addition, we saw solid gains across other significant products in the category, such as AQR Style Premia and First Quadrant tactical currency. 
Now turning to our equity products and starting with the global developed markets category, where a number of our largest products and strategies posted strong absolute and relative returns. Tweedy, Browne's flagship global value fund outperformed its benchmark and peers in the quarter, further improving its long-term track record. Through the quarter, this fund held the top 5- and 10-year track records in Morningstar's foreign large value category. In addition, Harding Loevner once again outperformed benchmarks and peers both at international and global equity strategies. Both strategies also feature near or above top decile long-term track records in their respective Morningstar categories. On the other hand, AQR and Artemis underperformed their benchmarks, although they still maintained good long-term performance records in the major non-U.S. equity strategies.
Turning to our emerging markets category. We had very broad-based, strong relative performance. Almost all of our major products at the Affiliates, including AQR, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Trilogy, posted good absolute and relative returns. Standouts included Genesis global emerging markets and Harding Loevner emerging markets, each of which outpaced the benchmark by over 250 basis points.
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, many of our U.S. growth strategies are biased towards quality growth and away from high beta stocks, and we benefited from that in the quarter as they generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers. This includes the largest products of Frontier and TimesSquare. On the U.S. value side, our largest U.S. equity contributor, Yacktman, saw their focused fund and diversified fund each outperform peers for the quarter, allowing them to maintain their top decile returns year-to-date and for the trailing year. And both funds still rank in the first percentile of their Morningstar category across the last 10- and 15-year periods.
Now turning to flows for the quarter. And I'll reiterate that flows to both the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy. First, we were pleased to generate another quarter of positive net client cash flows of $630 million, bringing us to positive flows in 22 out of the last 24 quarters. Within our flows this quarter, there are a couple of themes to identify. 
First, as we've discussed on previous calls, we remain very well-positioned to participate in the trend of rising allocations to alternatives across distribution channels, and we benefited from this trend again this quarter. As Sean said, investors are increasingly using alternatives to achieve their investment objectives, either to generate uncorrelated returns or for risk mitigation, and our Affiliates feature some of the best offerings in liquid and illiquid alternatives, whether for institutional, retail or high net worth investors. While there have been a lot of headlines about the challenges so-called hedge funds are facing, we should all be very careful to separate those from the strong underlying trend of flows to alternatives more broadly, a trend we believe will continue and which we are very well-positioned to participate in. 
Second, the quarter was really a tale of 2 parts, with a relatively good first 2 months giving way to June, which was impacted significantly by the Brexit vote and the volatility around it. 
Now moving to specifics for the quarter and starting with the institutional channel, we had net outflows of $2.9 billion in the quarter. There were 3 broad reasons for the negative net flows in the channel. First, we saw the funding process for several significant mandates slow in the back half of the quarter. A couple of cases were explicitly linked to Brexit-related uncertainty. Second, we did experience some outflows from petrodollar-related clients. And third, unusually, we did not have any meaningful closes in our long-locked capital products at firms such as Pantheon, EIG and Baring Asia, that was really just an idiosyncratic dynamic related to the quarter. There is significant demand for these illiquid products. So it is a matter of incidental timing in how the fund-raising cycles across Affiliates stacked up.
Turning to the high net worth channel. We had record inflows of $1.7 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were SMAs sold through our broker-dealer channel, especially in municipal bonds, as well as our AMG Wealth Partners platform, where we continue to see good traction developing. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. From an asset class perspective, flows this quarter were driven by strong inflows for alternatives and emerging market equities offerings, and we continue to benefit from the much better U.S. equity redemption rates. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to net positive flows were AQR and Harding Loevner. We did have some elevated retail outflows at our U.K. Affiliate, Artemis, in the second half of the quarter, particularly in our U.K.-oriented strategies following the Brexit vote. But as markets recover, we expect this to continue to abate.
More broadly, while there is still a lot to be determined regarding the outcome, we do not see the Brexit vote having a significant direct impact on our distribution efforts or our Affiliates' operations more broadly. In fact, in the area most likely to be impacted, the retail channel across the U.K. and Europe, our Affiliate product offerings, even from our U.K.-based Affiliates, are mostly domiciled outside of the U.K. and should be relatively unaffected; or domiciled in the U.K. but also sold to U.K. clients. 
Looking ahead, with our outstanding and growing array of high-quality equity and alternative products along with our unique distribution strategy, which includes both the Affiliates and distribution teams, as well as AMG's focused, complementary resources, we believe we are very well-positioned for meaningful organic growth ahead.
With that, let me turn to Jay to discuss the financials."
24445,377731153,1020769,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in a quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has a differentiated ability to produce stable earnings across a range of market environments, and with the addition of Winton and Capul",962,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in a quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has a differentiated ability to produce stable earnings across a range of market environments, and with the addition of Winton and Capula, we will further diversify and increase the earnings power of our business. 
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.06 for the second quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.10. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.97.
Turning to more specific modeling items. For the second quarter, our EBITDA was $220.3 million and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.6 basis points or approximately 13.1 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to decline to approximately 13.1 basis points, reflecting lower performance fees, which is typical in a third quarter. 
As a reminder, we will report our recent new investments on a 1-quarter lag. As a result, this will have the effect of lowering our earnings for the second half of 2016 but not thereafter, as we closed Capula in July and we expect to close Winton in the fourth quarter without reporting their respective income in the quarter in which we closed. I will further describe the timing and cost of funding of these new investments in a moment.
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% and our cash tax rate was 18.8%. In the third quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the second quarter were 23 point -- $21.3 million. We expect this number to remain at approximately $21 million in the third quarter. And for the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $87 million. 
Our share reported amortization for the second quarter was $37 million, which includes $14.8 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the third quarter, we expect our share of amortization to decline to approximately $35 million. And for the full year 2016, we expect amortization to be approximately $145 million. 
Our share of interest expense for the second quarter was $21.9 million. In the third quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to be approximately $24 million, reflecting the higher revolver balance from the closing of Capula. For the full year 2016, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $90 million. 
Other economic items for the second quarter were $0.8 million. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. In June, we announced new investments for the total purchase price of $800 million and simultaneously entered into a forward equity contract for up to 2.9 million shares, a structure which we have used several times in the past. Of the available 2.9 million shares, we expect to issue 2.5 million shares for $400 million in proceeds in the fourth quarter upon closing Winton, with the remainder of the purchase price funded under our revolver. 
Given this funding profile as well as the ongoing strength of our balance sheet and the quality and diversity of our business, we were placed on positive outlook by S&P.
With our flexible capital structure, we are well-positioned for growth in a range of market environments, and looking ahead, the strength and scale of our business which generates run rate EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available by year-end under our revolver, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance. We are updating our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.30 to $13.30. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through Friday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth for the fourth quarter. As per our convention, given the pacing of our 2016 new investments, our guidance does not assume incremental share repurchases for the balance of 2016. We expect our weighted average share count for 2016 to be approximately 55 million, which includes the expected equity issuance in the fourth quarter.
Given the meaningful run rate impact of our recent new investments which is not reflected in 2016, as well as a full year impact of the fourth quarter share issuance, we are providing preliminary guidance for 2017, as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $14 to $16. This range assumes the full year effect of our 2016 new investments, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and each quarter thereafter, and includes our normal model convention for share repurchase in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017. 
The lower ends of our guidance ranges includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper ends assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So I think first, I would say that the Brexit vote, the slowed fundings really where the uncertainty around it. So we actually saw that show up more broadly through the month of June than just right after the vote. So there's actually that uncertainty running into it, we saw a few things sort of push out. That was the first. And then the second is as you say, we didn't have any closes in long-locked capital products, which is the other underlying sort of trend I'd give you. And then yes, of course as you say, it is always lumpy. And so the timing of the close on 1 or 2 fundings ends up -- can end up impacting that gross sales number. But the only other thing I'd say just to follow on to your question is, look, July was a good month and the institutional pipeline looks really strong. And partly, that is probably because of some things that slipped from Q2 into the back half of the year, but the RFP levels and the finals -- activity levels are really fantastic. And so maybe even a nuance there, which is that description I gave of June was really on funding, not really on activity level. Because again, activity level through the quarter was actually quite good."

But as you say, it will be lumpy. But those are all very significant things. I do want to be clear, we did have some additional pieces in, but there was nothing that was sort of a meaningful close on long-lock, which again, if you look across the breadth and diversity of that product set across the Affiliates we sort of talked about, it's quite unusual to not have anything. But again, as I said, it was just the accident of how things stacked up. And then I think our petrodollar, kind of the exposures, still one of the lowest, I think, in the industry, frankly.

Maybe just to give you the backdrop of the last time we gave guidance -- at the time we gave that guidance in the quarter, which was May 2, we were already up about 1%. And as you can see from our AUM table, we experienced about 1.3% market change for the full quarter, and I also note that FX impacted it by about 0.5% negative. So we really -- from the last time we gave guidance, markets really haven't changed materially, so it really was not market-related. And then when you look at what happened quarter-to-date July, we've effectively experienced about 2% up in our blend, which would be exactly consistent with what the quarter would expect. So there's really no change to our forward forecast with respect to beta because we got the 2% that I just described. So really, the 3 items are the quarter lag. Closed in July, Capula, but we won't report until the fourth quarter. Expect to close Winton in October, but won't report till the first quarter of 2017. But we will have the revolver balance and the 2.5 million share issuance in this calendar year. And so that's the first bit. The second bit then would be our model convention, given the pacing of new investments, the $1.3 billion I mentioned earlier. We would, from a guidance and a model perspective, not assume any more share repurchases. So that has an impact. And then lastly, we've taken down our performance fee expectation just modestly, but that's the third piece here."

And maybe just at a first answer at a bit of a high level, but our Affiliates that are interacting with retirement advisers -- retirement investors are already fiduciaries. And so the retirement piece of our business is modest. It's actually, frankly, an area where we should be able to grow our business and there should be real opportunities for us there over time. That said, right, there are definitely going to be ways that the rules are impacting the way products are sold by intermediaries we work with, and that is where most of our retirement business is. And so we're probably thinking about this same way many others are from that perspective, which is, okay, what are the things we can be doing to be a supportive partner as we're sort of working through as they're working through primarily, but as they are working through this. So again, not a particularly large piece of our business, the places that we're interacting directly already with retirement investors, we're already fiduciaries, it's 100% of our business.

As you heard us say in the prepared remarks, generally speaking, the new investment pipeline continues to be strong. I guess I would say, looking back over what we've done over the last year and trying to imagine looking forward, I think there's probably a little more balance in the mix, a little more traditional and perhaps a bit more U.S. based. But that's, I think, just the -- really just the incidental element of the pipeline and our relationship set and not anything that I would call an enduring trend. I think because the overall opportunity is very much global and includes, of course, excellent alternative firms as well as traditional long-only. So to your question about whether the recent volatility has done anything to impact the pipeline, I would say not really. I mean, I could maybe argue that to the extent that markets have recovered, that the -- that there might be a greater inclination to move forward, but it's not anything we've seen from the discussions that we're in the midst of. And in terms of the forward part of the pipeline, that continues to be positive with, I would say, transactions that we've been working on, as well as ones that we're just at the earlier stages of. And finally, with respect to your question about pricing, I would say for the best firms, it's -- you always have to pay fair prices. We, as you know, don't participate in auctions, don't try to ""win"" auctions. And firms which choose to partner with AMG are making a much broader decision beyond just the valuation of the -- portion of the firm's revenues that we're acquiring in the initial transaction. There are pockets of the industry, I would call out probably private equity firms, where there's a lot of activity and I would say a supply-demand balance among buyers and sellers which is less favorable. But even there, we still find opportunities to invest in a sensible basis. And on an overall, it continues to be very much an execution of our new investment strategy in the same way that we've been doing it for 2 decades, building on relationships that we've established in -- over years, and then making investments as a -- as a product of all the relationships, and the description of our investment structure and how that fits with the prospective Affiliates' long-term succession plans."

So how do we spend the $1 billion in EBITDA that the business generates is, of course, a much more important and relevant question than it was 3 years ago, 5 years ago. We have a long track record of returning capital to shareholders when we see periods of relatively lower new investment opportunities. And over time, inevitably, as the business grows, there will be fewer and fewer periods where all of the cash, or the largest part of the cash, is used up by new investment opportunities. And so what we see going forward and in terms of the quality and pacing and magnitude of new investments is hard to gauge. As you've heard us say, we're -- we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects for adding outstanding new Affiliates which will generate earnings accretion and broaden and diversify our product set and enhance our business in other ways. So to the extent we have those opportunities, that will continue to be the primary focus of our capital activity. That said, inevitably, the pacing of new investment opportunities, and again over time, as the business grows, new and -- sorry, the repurchase of shares will continue to be, and over time maybe I would say, even be a more important element of our capital management. That part's philosophy. And the commitment to return capital and not to just build cash on the balance sheet is also a part of our philosophy. But the amount and timing of repurchase relative to new investments is difficult to forecast. And I think if you look at our track record, we expect that we will continue to do both and do both in a meaningful way."

We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase yea",801,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year. Our results reflect consistently strong execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of several new Affiliate investments during the quarter along with the continued excellent investment performance and strong positive net client cash flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe, we continue to see strong earnings growth ahead for AMG. 
We were pleased with our third quarter net client cash flows of $5.8 billion into our Affiliates actively-managed strategies during the quarter, particularly across an array of alternative products. As Nate will discuss, our net inflows were positive across each of our institutional, retail and high network channels and also across all client geographies. 
We believe that the quality of our independent boutique Affiliates and the unique breadth and diversity of our alpha product set have together driven the consistency of our organic growth results over the past 7 years. AMG has now generated net inflows in 24 of the last 26 quarters, including year-to-date net inflows of approximately $11.5 billion, notwithstanding continued muted industry-wide flows into actively managed products. 
The strength of our results reflect the success of our strategy of partnering with outstanding performance-driven boutiques and our focus on attractive alpha-oriented product areas, especially global and emerging market equities and a select set of alternative strategies. The best independent boutiques have meaningful competitive advantages in generating excess returns and value-added alpha-generating product areas, as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. Even in a period of growth in passive products, on the back of cyclical and to some extent secular trends, select high-performing differentiated active equity and alternative managers will continue to generate organic growth and gain market share as evidenced by our long-term record of net inflows. In an environment of lower returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors recognize the importance of alpha generation in meeting their obligations and objectives. In seeking alpha, investors increasingly turn to differentiator high-conviction strategies. And given their focused and distinct investment approaches in the most attractive product areas, our Affiliates are positioned to benefit from this dynamic. We continue to see significant client demand for high-conviction active equity and alternative strategies across client geographies and channels. 
Through our long-term strategic focus on areas, where boutiques excel and we see secular client demand trends, AMG has assembled one of the largest and most diverse books of alternative products in the industry focused on the product areas most attractive to clients. These strategies include both liquid and illiquid products and offer not only alpha, but also true diversification relative to traditional fixed income and equity market, a feature increasingly valued by clients. We are already benefiting from growing client demand for these alternative strategies. And given our investments in some of the highest quality firms around the world, which specialize in these areas, AMG is uniquely placed to continue to meet this enduring demand trend. AMG's array of alternative strategies is a strong complement to our outstanding equity offering. And we believe that the advantages of our strategic position across our broad alternative product set will be increasingly evident. 
Turning to new investments. We continue to see will positioned to execute on our substantial forward opportunities set and further enhance the diversity and breadth of our performance-oriented product offering by partnering with leading independent firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG, and we're very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline, which includes both traditional and alternative firm. Looking ahead, AMG has a unique ability to make additional investments that are not only on earnings-accretive, but also add excellent new products with substantial capacity in defined areas, where we see ongoing client demand. Given the outstanding opportunities we see to invest in excellent independent firms globally along with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we're well-positioned for strong earnings growth going forward. Finally, I wanted to discuss the management change that we announced this morning. As you saw, Andrew Dyson is stepping down as Head of Global Distribution to take a CEO your role as subsidiary of Financial called QMA. Andrew has been a great friend and colleague over the past 5 years and has made a valuable contribution to AMG. We wish Andrew all the best in his new role.
As you would expect, we've a search underway and plan to move forward with a new Head of Global Distribution early in 2017. With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail."

As Sean said, against the backdrop of muted industry demand for actively-managed strategies, we generated strong net in the quarter across all 3 of our distribution channels. This continues our broadly positive flow results for the past 7 years, which ultimately stem from our Affiliates excellent long-term investment performance and track record. In addition, as Sean said, we're also continuing to benefit from our strategic product positioning against some positive demand trend, as well as our unique distribution of product, which includes each Affiliate dedicated capabilities, complemented by AMG's global distribution effort. While these growth have been remarkably consistent, positive in 24 of the last 26 quarters for example, it is important to look at the long-term performance, long-term strategic positioning and our fundamental distribution strategy. As we regularly remind, particularly in the institutional and sub-advisory channel, can be lumpy in any given quarter. So looking over a longer period provides a clear picture, and on that basis, we continue to generate consistent positive net flow. that the point Sean made, one of the most important drivers of our organic growth over the last several years, has been our decision to increase our participation in alternative and with in alternative the areas we chosen to focus on. To our active and consistent investment activity and significant product development by our Affiliates, we are one of the largest managers of alternative in the industry. While one key point, is that our Affiliate Manager very diverse portfolio of alternative strategies across the wide range of investment category, and equally important point, as we have substantial participation in areas of alternatives and high demand from institutional and retail clients as they seek return while also trying to diversify their location. 
Finally, we also see tremendous business benefits from these high-quality alternative firms and products, coupled with an excellent traditional boutiques and products. 
Let me now turn to the performance and alternatives category. Performance in the fixed income and equity relative value segment was strong, including positive performance from key products at AQR, Blue Mountain, and resulting in a multi-strategy and multiethnic category mixed risk-parity strategies generated strong returns in the quarter and year-to-date, while multi-asset AQR was down slightly in the quarter. diversified category, this quarter was a challenging one for trend followers due to several sharp trends reversal. However, these strategies feature important diversification benefits at the overall client portfolio level and we continue to see strong demand globally for the category. Because of this diversifying we believe relative returns are much more important determinant of client demand than absolute return down from the quarter both AQR and outperformed the trend following the while Systematica underperformed in the quarter. In addition, all 3 firms feature excellent performance over the long-term. Our private equity and real assets, focused Affiliates and teams continue to put work and feature excellent long-term performance as well, and we see significant opportunities for Baring Asia and the to continue to broaden and diversify their industry-leading investment platform. As it relates to our public equity products, a very strong risk on quarter across broad market indices saw out-performance from that were typically high risk and volatility as well as lower quality. Against that backdrop, the relative performance of our Affiliates given this environment, was more mixed, as many of our Affiliates valuation and strong fundamentals in their investment processes.
So in with the global development market category. We had good performance from flagship strategy and AQR, both of which delivered strong performance on an absolute and relative basis in the quarter adding to their already strong long-term track record. Elsewhere, performance was more mixed than while value underperformed, although it continues to have an industry-leading long-term track record. In the emerging markets category, all of our strategies were up on an absolute basis but performance against the index was more mixed with AQR and was outperforming and Genesis and trailing in the quarter. Finally, the equity performance across our book of products was mixed in the quarter, although, many of the larger strategies have versus Frontier and Systematica outperformed their indices in the quarter as recently launched three of the equity product at
Now turning to flows for the quarter. Let me first the importance of looking at our flow trends over the long-term to understand our ability to drive organic growth. We have always said, in any given period, our flows will be lumpy, and if anything, the volatility is only increased in the current environment. 
Starting with institutional channel. We had net inflows of $2.8 billion with growth in flows again over $13 million. As I discussed earlier, we had a specially strong growth in net flows in several parts of alternatives books, including multi-strategy and commodity. In the high net worth channel, we had net flows of $1 billion. Flows remained strong from separate account, both directly as well as drove our partner's Affiliate. Speaking more broadly about our partners business, last week we reached agreement to invest in a fixed partner Affiliate And when a that investment closes, our wealth partners Affiliates will of a total of nearly $40 billion in assets. We are very excited of our investment in which is based in New York City and Philadelphia and provides outsourced CIO services as well wealth advisory and planning to high net worth client. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $2 billion. We saw mostly a continuation of the positive trends from last few quarters in this channel. Asset class drivers were once again alternative in emerging market equities, AQR, and only once again, some moderating outflows in our U.S. equities book. 
Looking ahead, our industry-leading array of high-quality equity and alternatives products features excellent long-term performance, while flows in any given period of we remain well-positioned to generate positive organic growth through both our Affiliates and distribution, as well as AMG's complementary global distribution platform. With that, let me turn over to Jay to discuss our financial."

As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, increasing the strength, diversity and earnings power of our business.
As you saw in the release, we report economic earnings per share of $3.02 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.02. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2. 
Turning to more specific modeling items, during the quarter, we updated our non-GAAP disclosures to rename EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA, but there was no change the of this performance measure. For the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $219.8 million, which did not include our recent new investments given the 1 quarter lag in reporting. The ratio of our adjusted EBITDA to end of period assets under management was 13.1 basis points or 13 basis points excluding performance fees. In the fourth quarter, we expect this ratio to increase to approximately 16 basis points reflecting a higher performance fee contribution that we typically realize in the fourth quarter. With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax base for the quarter was 31.9%, reflecting a further decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate, and our cash tax rate was 19.7%. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximate 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $19.5 million. We expect this number to increase to $21 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, 2016, we expect our intangible-related differ taxes to be approximately $84 million. Our share of reported amortization for the third quarter was $34.2 million, which includes $14 million of amortization for the Affiliate accounted for under the equity method.
For the fourth quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to approximately $37 million as a result of recently closed new investment. And for the full year, 2016, we expect our share of amortization to be approximately $143 million. Our share of interest expense for the quarter was $22.4 million, and the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain approximately $22 million, and for the full year, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $88 million. Other economic items in the third quarter were $1.6 million, and for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the beginning of the third quarter, we closed our investment in which was partially funded with $150 million in forward equity proceeds. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we closed our investment which we initially funded under the revolver. We expect to settle another $250 million in forward equity proceeds by the end of the fourth quarter. Given the scale and diversity of our business together with our flexible capital structure, we've successfully funded over $1.3 billion in new investments year-to-date. And looking ahead, the earnings power of our business has increased with the addition of generating run rate EBITDA of over $1 billion along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available at year-end, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we continue to execute on our new investment strategy and return capital shareholders overtime.
Now turning to guidance. We're leaving our 2016 and 2017 guidance unchanged. Our 2016 economic earnings per share range of $12.30 to $13.30 reflects market performance through last Friday, our current view of what quarter performance fees and weighted average share count of approximately $55 million for 2016. Our 2017 economic earnings per share range of $14 to $16, assumes the full year impact of capital in as well as the equity issuance under the our normal model convention of 2% quality market growth beginning in first quarter 2017 of 2017 and each quarter thereafter, and includes our normal model convention for share repurchases in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income.
As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately $56 million for the full year, 2017.
The lower end of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution for performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assume a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flow. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectations Affiliate growth rate, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earning. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectation. Now we will be happy to answer any questions."

When we launched our distribution strategy 15 years ago, the core vision was to offer Affiliates the benefit of scale and institutional, especially global institution and retail markets on the basis that was bespoke, that suited for them and complementary to each of their own distribution strategies and efforts. We established our U.S. retail platform in 2004, and opened our first non-U.S. institutional distribution office couple of years later in Australia. In fact, in a few weeks I'll be in Sydney celebrating the 10th anniversary of our office founding. Andrew has been a valued member of our team, for sure, since he joined 5 years ago, but our strategic vision, commitment to the business remain completely consistent. And remember, for clients, we're providing unique offering where the clients, especially global clients, but increasingly retail clients, get the benefit of focused expertise of industry-leading specialist firms, combined with or backed by the scale, resources and operational risk management of a global franchise. And they get, especially in these far-flung markets the benefit of in-market client service and a single point assess to this very broad array of many of the industries best boutique firms. And if you  want any demonstration or validation of the effectiveness of this strategy, you have only to look at the success we've had over the past 7 years. As you know, 24 out of the past 26 quarters strong, positive flows in our active equity and alternative products set. It's a record that we compare to any in the industry. The one other question that you asked is, when you'll get an announcement. And I think in my prepared remarks I said, early 2017, and I think I'm going to stick with that."

Can you go through the moving parts from what we heard from you last when you first -- when you gave guidance last? And then, the range from fourth quarter seems a bit largely.

As you said, we did the guidance on change, primarily, because the impact from market beta was only modest. It only had a modest impact on the fourth quarter as you would expect given that we were 3 quarters away through the year. But just on the components, when we last gave guidance, which was August 1st, our market blend at that time was 2% up from the prior transcript. As you can see from our AUM tables, we experienced approximately 3.1% in market changes, which included FX and put those 2 numbers together for the entire quarter. So 3.1% versus a 2% that we knew about, it had a positive impact of 1.1% relative to last time we gave guidance going through the end of the quarter. So that was through the end of the third quarter. Since the beginning of fourth quarter though, we have seen markets, including FX off about 1.5%. So it took that positive one down to a negative 0.5%. I think the other thing that you're probably aware of is, that when we remove our 2% market growth this option for the fourth quarter relative to our model that has a negative impact. So really down 2.5% from the model. All that being said though, given it's the four quarter, it will only have a small impact on '16. So we left guidance unchanged because setting markets aside, our 2016 range is primarily a on performance fees as you had mentioned. And when we look at various performances for the remainder of the year, both up and down scenarios, we have considered a few lumpy performance fees as well as the timing between 2016 and 2017 in certain products. So considering all of that, that's why we left the range unchanged. Just to remind you, a couple of other items for 2016, there is quarter lag in the financial reporting for capital in so we felt no impact in capital in this quarter other than funding of we will see a impact in the fourth quarter with being included, but we will not see until next year. Second, we'll no more -- the model purposes, no more share repurchases for 2016. None of these items will affect '17. So we'll have the full effect of and we'll return to our normal model guidance. And then, lastly, just to touch on 2017. Even though we removed the 2% market and we were down a little bit quarter-to-date, and we feel comfortable that our 2017 guidance range still captures our forward opportunity set, especially since we have full year of both and in the numbers for next year. We also have included the full year effect of the $400 million of equity, $150 million has already been issued, $250 million in the fourth quarter. And remind me, model convention again, all of these numbers are included in our $56 million share count -- average weighted share count for 2017. And then finally, just on performance fee expectations for next year, with the addition of as well as just the product diversity within our performance fee opportunity, we see kind of mid-teens at the midpoint of the guidance range for next year in terms of performance fee contribution."

As we touched in our prepared remarks, significantly higher growth sales and alternatives, AQR is contributor there, but it was  it was a number of firms that contributed significantly there. Also we had relatively lower redemption rate for alternatives. So that was sort of the alternatives category that did quite well. We also saw an uptick in growth sales in the U.S. equities. And sort of same things moderating alpha in the U.S. equity. So I think it was a couple of things there. I've talked already about sort of fourth quarter and some other there, but I think, again the main thing to focus on is, as you look follower in the institution channel is, the trends we think we've been benefiting from, the headwinds of 5%, those remain intact. And it's how the people get returns in the portfolio,, is how the people continue to passive and active, and how well-positioned we're to continue for those active allocations. We have a large number, a very good performance product in high demand areas, global and emerging market, and also as we've talked about, and then we've got, as Sean mentioned, we've got this unique sort of go-to-market distribution strategy, combined with Affiliates-focused team at their level with the scope and scale of a large institution with significant sort of expertise by geography or by channel to bring to bear Affiliates as they want it.

So I'll try to address some, and then Nate I'll ask you to fill in. The contribution to our flows from ""AMG distribution"" vary quarter-to-quarter, and we don't track in a direct way, because a lot of the influence is going to be in indirect way. So I would say, over time, it is an aggregate over the past 6, 7 years about $50 billion in incremental contribution at least. And in any given period, it's been half, sometimes more than half, and sometimes, of course, given the dynamics of a particular quarter, it's a less significant contribution. So I think the trend lines remain very much consistent and intact. As you heard Nate describe, we feel very good about our forward opportunity, especially, I mean, ultimately fundamentally driven by the quality and performance of our Affiliates, but their distribution and our distribution, alongside theirs is absolutely contributing to our continued organic growth. Looking ahead, as I said, we see no change. There will be, of course, inevitable evolution, adaptation, growth in our distribution capabilities and strategy, but no fundamental change to division or strategy. We're looking for a -- and I'm very confident we'll find a very high quality, experienced-driven, motivated person who is a cultural fit with our team, and of course, with our Affiliates and our overall corporate philosophy.

I do think -- the other thing, I think we've also said before is, we're probably doing much the same thing as many other people similarly situated, which is we're trying to help our distribution partners, the people that we work through. And if we're trying to figure out how we can best partner with them as they evolve the way they bring their offering to market. I do think there's some other thing that I would add, which is, I think we're -- while we have a small share, we're relatively well-positioned as you look at how those partners maybe evolving their businesses. So we don't really have brokerage. We're almost all in the advisory side. We have by and large the right kinds of share classes -- that will be attractive. And then importantly, and this picks up on a point made earlier, this is a place where we can be enormously useful to our Affiliates, because having the scope and scale and breadth to be a good partner to -- while as they go through the product rationalization, may be very, very important. So it's not a direct impact, and their piece is small -- relatively small part of our business today, d while there will be a bunch of noise and work as we go through this, I do think there are opportunities on that kind of medium to long-term flows to partner well with our channel partners"

And so those are the prices where you're seeing the pressure. But even in those areas, the strongest managers are both continuing to do well and continue to attract assets, and also will ultimately benefit from that evolution or shake out or And then again, as Sean said, the long-term thesis around attractiveness of these kinds of products in terms of the need for people to get them in their portfolio is, we think absolutely, intact."

We spent some money offshore, and the effect of non-U.S. corporate taxes are lower than U.S. corporate taxes. So having AMG avail ourselves at the global rate has lowered our both GAAP and cash rate.

We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase yea",805,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year. Our results reflect consistently strong execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of several new Affiliate investments during the quarter along with the continued excellent investment performance and strong positive net client cash flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe, we continue to see strong earnings growth ahead for AMG. 
We were pleased with our third quarter net client cash flows of $5.8 billion into our Affiliates actively-managed strategies during the quarter, particularly across an array of alternative products. As Nate will discuss, our net inflows were positive across each of our institutional, retail and high network channels and also across all client geographies. 
We believe that the quality of our independent boutique Affiliates and the unique breadth and diversity of our alpha product set have together driven the consistency of our organic growth results over the past 7 years. AMG has now generated net inflows in 24 of the last 26 quarters, including year-to-date net inflows of approximately $11.5 billion, notwithstanding continued muted industry-wide flows into actively managed products. 
The strength of our results reflect the success of our strategy of partnering with outstanding performance-driven boutiques and our focus on attractive alpha-oriented product areas, especially global and emerging market equities and a select set of alternative strategies. The best independent boutiques have meaningful competitive advantages in generating excess returns and value-added alpha-generating product areas, as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. Even in a period of growth in passive products, on the back of cyclical and to some extent secular trends, select high-performing differentiated active equity and alternative managers will continue to generate organic growth and gain market share as evidenced by our long-term record of net inflows. In an environment of lower returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors recognize the importance of alpha generation in meeting their obligations and objectives. In seeking alpha, investors increasingly turn to differentiator high-conviction strategies. And given their focused and distinct investment approaches in the most attractive product areas, our Affiliates are positioned to benefit from this dynamic. We continue to see significant client demand for high-conviction active equity and alternative strategies across client geographies and channels. 
Through our long-term strategic focus on areas, where boutiques excel and we see secular client demand trends, AMG has assembled one of the largest and most diverse books of alternative products in the industry focused on the product areas most attractive to clients. These strategies include both liquid and illiquid products and offer not only alpha, but also true diversification relative to traditional fixed income and equity market, a feature increasingly valued by clients. We are already benefiting from growing client demand for these alternative strategies. And given our investments in some of the highest quality firms around the world, which specialize in these areas, AMG is uniquely placed to continue to meet this enduring demand trend. AMG's array of alternative strategies is a strong complement to our outstanding equity offering. And we believe that the advantages of our strategic position across our broad alternative product set will be increasingly evident. 
Turning to new investments. We continue to see will positioned to execute on our substantial forward opportunity set and further enhance the diversity and breadth of our performance-oriented product offering by partnering with leading independent firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG, and we're very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline, which includes both traditional and alternative firm. Looking ahead, AMG has a unique ability to make additional investments that are not only earnings accretive, but also add excellent new products with substantial capacity in defined areas where we see ongoing client demand. Given the outstanding opportunities we see to invest in excellent independent firms globally along with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we're well positioned for strong earnings growth going forward. 
Finally, I wanted to discuss the management change that we announced this morning. As you saw, Andrew Dyson is stepping down as Head of Global Distribution to take a CEO your role at a subsidiary of Prudential Financial called QMA. Andrew has been a great friend and colleague over the past 5 years and has made a valuable contribution to AMG. We wish Andrew all the best in his new role.
As you would expect, we have a search underway and plan to move forward with the new head of Global Distribution early in 2017. With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail."
24445,407191352,1067418,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, against the backdrop of muted industry demand for actively managed strategies, we generated strong net flows in the quarter across all 3 of our distribution channels. This continues our broadly positive fl",1057,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, against the backdrop of muted industry demand for actively managed strategies, we generated strong net flows in the quarter across all 3 of our distribution channels. This continues our broadly positive flow results for the past 7 years, which ultimately stem from our Affiliates' excellent long-term investment performance and track record. In addition, as Sean said, we're also continuing to benefit from our strategic product positioning against some positive client demand trend; as well as our unique distribution of product, which includes each Affiliate's dedicated distribution capabilities complemented by AMG's global distribution effort. While these flows have been remarkably consistent, positive in 24 of the last 26 quarters, for example, it is important to look at the long-term performance, long-term strategic positioning and our fundamental distribution strategy. As we regularly remind, flow, particularly in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, can be lumpy in any given quarter. So looking over a longer period provides a clear picture. And on that basis, we continue to generate consistent positive net flow. 
Now picking up on the point Sean made, one of the most important drivers of our organic growth over the last several years has been our decision to increase our participation in alternative, and within alternative, the areas we've chosen to focus on. Through our active and consistent new investment activity and significant product development by our Affiliates, we're one of the largest managers of alternative in the industry. Well, one key point is our affiliate manager vary diverse portfolio of alternative strategies across a wide range of investment category. And equally important point, we have substantial participation in areas of alternatives and high demand from institutional and retail clients as they seek returns while also trying to diversify their allocation. 
Finally, we also see tremendous business diversification benefits from these high-quality alternative firms and products when they're coupled with our excellent traditional boutiques and products. 
Let me now turn to the performance in alternatives category. Performance in the fixed income and equity relative value segment was strong, including positive performance from key products at AQR, BlueMountain, Capula and ValueAct. Results from our multi-strategy and multi-asset category was mixed. Risk-parity strategies generated strong returns in the quarter and year-to-date, while multi-asset-style premier AQR was down slightly in the quarter. 
Within our systematic diversified category, this quarter was a challenging one for trend followers due to several sharp trend reversals. However, these strategies feature important diversification benefits at the overall client portfolio level, and we continue to see strong demand globally for the category. Because of their diversifying characteristics, we believe relative returns are much more important determinant of client demand than absolute returns. And while it was down for the quarter, both AQR and Winton outperformed the trend following the [indiscernible], while Systematica underperformed in the quarter. In addition, all 3 firms feature excellent performance over the long term. 
Our private equity and real assets, focused Affiliates and teams continue to put work and feature excellent long-term performance as well, and we see significant opportunities for firms like Pantheon, Baring Asia and EIG to continue to broaden and diversify their industry-leading investment platform. 
As it relates to our public equity product, a very strong risk on quarter across broad market indices saw outperformance from stocks that were technically higher risk and volatility as well as lower quality. Against that backdrop, the relative performance of our Affiliates, given this environment, was more mixed, as many of our Affiliates emphasize valuation and strong fundamentals in their investment processes.
Starting with global developed markets category, Harding Loevner and AQR, both of which delivered strong performance on an absolute and relative basis in the quarter, adding to their already strong long-term track record. Elsewhere, performance was more mixed at Artemis, while [indiscernible] value underperformed, although it continues to have an industry-leading long-term track record. 
In the emerging markets category, all of our strategies were up on an absolute basis, but performance against the EM index was more mixed with AQR and Trilogy emerging outperforming and Genesis and Harding Loevner trailing in the quarter. Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, performance across our book of products was mixed in the quarter, although many of the larger strategies at firms such as Frontier and Systematic outperformed their indices in the quarter as did recently launched [indiscernible] equity products and our U.K. Affiliated [indiscernible]. 
Now turning to flows for the quarter. Let me first the importance of looking at our flow trends over the long term to understand our ability to drive organic growth. We've always said, in any given period, our flows will be lumpy. And if anything, the volatility has only increased in the current environment. Starting with institutional channel, we had net inflows of $2.8 billion, with growth in flows again over of $13 million. As I discussed earlier, we had especially strong growth in net flows in several parts of our alternatives books, including CTAs, multi-strategy and commodity. In the high net worth channel, we had net flows of $1 billion. Flows remained strong from separate accounts, both directly as well as drove our partners' Affiliate. 
Speaking more broadly about our partners' business, last week we reached agreement to invest in our 6th wealth partner Affiliate, [indiscernible] Trust. And when that investment closes, our wealth partners Affiliates will advise in a total of nearly $40 billion in assets. We're very excited about our investment in [indiscernible] Trust, which is based in New York City and Philadelphia and provides outsourced CIO services as well as wealth advisory and planning to ultra-high net worth client. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $2 billion. We saw mostly a continuation of the positive trends from the last few quarters in this channel. Asset class drivers were once again Alternatives and emerging market equities with firms such as AQR, GW&K and 
Harding Loevner [indiscernible] only once again from moderating outflows in our U.S. equity  book. 
Looking ahead, our industry-leading array of high-quality equity and alternatives product features excellent long-term performance. While flows in any given period are volatile, we remain well positioned to generate positive organic growth through both our Affiliates and distribution as well as AMG's complementary global distribution platform. With that, let me turn it over to Jay to discuss our financials."
24445,407191352,1067418,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, increas",817,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, increasing the strength, diversity and earnings power of our business.
As you saw in the release, we report economic earnings per share of $3.02 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.02. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. During the quarter, we updated our non-GAAP disclosures to rename EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA, but there was no change in the calculation of this performance measure. For the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $219.8 million, which did not include our recent new investments, given the one quarter lag in reporting. The ratio of our adjusted EBITDA to end of period assets under management was 13.1 basis points or 13 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the fourth quarter, we expect this ratio to increase to approximately 16 basis points, reflecting a higher performance fee contribution that we typically realize in the fourth quarter. 
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax base for the quarter was 31.9%, reflecting a further decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate, and our cash tax rate was 19.7%. In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $19.5 million. We expect this number to increase to $21 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $84 million. Our share of reported amortization for the third quarter was $34.2 million, which includes $14 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the fourth quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to approximately $37 million as a result of recently closed new investment. And for the full year 2016, we expect our share of amortization to be approximately $143 million. 
Our share of interest expense for the third quarter was $22.4 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain approximately $22 million. And for the full year, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $88 million. Other economic items in the third quarter were $1.6 million. And for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the beginning of the third quarter, we closed our investment in Capula, which was partially funded with $150 million in forward equity proceeds. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we closed our investment in Winton, which we initially funded under the revolver. We expect to settle another $250 million in forward equity proceeds by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Given the scale and diversity of our business together with our flexible capital structure, we've successfully funded over $1.3 billion in new investments year-to-date. And looking ahead, the earnings power of our business has increased with the addition of Capula and Winton generating run rate EBITDA of over $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available at year end, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we continue to execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance. We're leaving our 2016 and 2017 guidance unchanged. Our 2016 economic earnings per share range of $12.30 to $13.30 reflects market performance through last Friday, our current view of fourth quarter performance fees [indiscernible] and weighted average share count of approximately $55 million for 2016. Our 2017 economic earnings per share range of $14 to $16 assumes the full year impact of Capula and Winton as well as the equity issuance under the Ford, our normal model convention of 2% quality market growth beginning in first quarter of 2017 of and each quarter thereafter and includes our normal model convention for share repurchases in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately $56 million for the full year 2017.
The lower end of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution for performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assume a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flow. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rate, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earning. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations. 
Now we will be happy to answer any questions."

So as we said sort of in our prepared remarks, we feel really good about the underlying trends and activity levels. And so focusing on the institutional channel, the ones I'd call out is sort of the levels of RFP activity and then certain levels of final activity, which were really strong and actually up again this quarter. So good balance activity in the third quarter. I think, as you say, it's hard to predict on sort of short-term look in 3 months, but I will say, I'm looking to the fourth quarter, that's often kind of a seasonally weak quarter for us. And I think a couple of those reasons for that. We've got kind of the year-end redemptions from both quarterly and annual lock vehicles. And we've obviously got the distribution of performance fees earned during the year. So those are a little bit of a headwind then. And then in retail, you often see people sort of reticent to buy ahead of kind of tax distribution and stuff. And then as I said in the prepared remarks, this year, there's actually more volatility in flows than normal. I think that's due to the macro environment. So wouldn't be surprised if you also saw some retail slow down due to just macro stuff like [indiscernible]. But that said, underlying and fundamentally, both with respect to the quarter and then sort of looking at our longer-term trend, as I said in the prepared remarks. Institutional pipelines were really strong, and RFP activity is good. Finance activity continues to pick up. And then, if you look at the medium term, obviously, we don't think the trends -- there are some headwinds, obviously, but the trends we're benefiting from remain intact. So -- and that's what's have to get returns in their portfolios. We do think people will continue to barb out between sort of passive on the one side and then return on the other. And our Affiliates are really well positioned to compete for and win those mandates and take share."

When we launched our distribution strategy 15 years ago, the core vision was to offer Affiliates the benefit of scale and institutional, especially global institutional and retail markets on a basis that was bespoke, that suited for them and complementary to each of their own distribution strategies and efforts. We established our U.S. retail platform in 2004 and opened our first non-U.S. institutional distribution office couple of years later in Australia. In fact, in a few weeks I'll be in Sydney celebrating the 10th anniversary of our office founding. Andrew has been a valued member of our team, for sure, since he joined 5 years ago. But our strategic vision, commitment to the business remain completely consistent. And remember, for clients, we're providing unique offering, where the clients, especially global institutional clients, but increasingly retail clients, get the benefit of the focused expertise of industry-leading specialist firms combined with or backed by the scale, resources and operational risk management of a global franchise. And they get, especially in these far-flung markets the benefit of in-market client service and a single point of access to this very broad array of many of the industry's best boutique firms. And if you want any demonstration of or validation of the effectiveness of this strategy, you have only to look at the success that we've had over the past 7 years. As you know, 24 out of the past 26 quarters strong, positive flows in our active equity and alternative product set. It's a record that we compare to any in the industry. Sorry, the one other question that you asked is, when you'll get an announcement. And I think in my prepared remarks, I said early 2017, and I think I'm going to stick with that. Thanks, Craig."

And as you've said, we did the guidance on change, primarily, because the impact from market beta was only modest. It will only have a modest impact on the fourth quarter as you would expect given that we are 3 quarters away through the year. But just on the components, when we last gave guidance, which was August 1st, our market blend at that time was 2% up from the prior transcript. As you can see from our AUM tables, we experienced approximately 3.1% in market changes, which included FX and put those 2 numbers together for the entire quarter. So 3.1% versus the 2% that we knew about, it had a positive impact of 1.1% relative to last time we gave guidance going through the end of the quarter. So that was through the end of the third quarter. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter though, we have seen markets, including FX, off about 1.5%. So it took that positive one down to a negative 0.5%. I think the other thing that you're probably aware of is, that when we remove our 2% market growth this option [ph] for the fourth quarter relative to our model, that has a negative impact. So really down 2.5% from the model. All that being said though, given it's the four quarter, it will only have a small impact on '16. So we left guidance unchanged because setting markets aside, our 2016 range is primarily a judgment on performance fees as you had mentioned. And when we look at various performance fees scenarios for the remainder of the year, both up and down scenarios, we have considered a few lumpy performance fees as well as the timing between 2016 and 2017 realization in certain products. So considering all of that, that's why we left the range unchanged. Just to remind you of a couple of other items for 2016, there is a quarter lag in the financial reporting for capital [indiscernible], so we felt no impact of capital in this quarter other than the funding of Capula, we will see an impact in the fourth quarter with Capula being included, but we will not see Winton till next year. Second, we'll assume no more -- for model purposes, no more share repurchases for 2016. None of these items will affect '17. So we'll have the full effect of Winton and Capula and we'll return to our normal model guidance. And then, lastly, just to touch on 2017. Even though we removed the 2% market and we were down a little bit quarter-to-date, and we feel comfortable that our 2017 guidance range still captures our forward opportunity set, especially since we have a full year of both Capula and Winton in the numbers for next year. We also have included the full year effect of the $400 million of equity. $150 million has already been issued, $250 million in the fourth quarter. And reminding you of our model convention again, all of these numbers are included in our 56 million share count -- average weighted share count for 2017. And then, finally, just on performance fee expectations for next year, with the addition of Winton and Capula as well as just the product diversity within our performance fee opportunity, we see kind of mid-teens at the midpoint of the guidance range for next year in terms of performance fee contribution."

Also, we had relatively lower redemption rate for alternatives. So that was sort of the alternatives category that did quite well. We also saw an uptick in growth sales in U.S. equities, and sort of same things that are moderating alpha in the U.S. equity. So I think it was a couple of things there. I've talked already about sort of fourth quarter and some other seasonality there, but I think, again the main thing to focus on is, as you look forward in the institution channel is, the trends that we think we've been benefiting from, the headwinds of 5%, those remain intact. And it's how do people get returns in the portfolios, it's how the people continue to barbell passive and active, and how well-positioned we are to continue for those active allocations, right? We have a large number of very good performing product in high demand areas, global and emerging markets, and also as we've talked about, and then we've got -- as Sean mentioned, we've got this unique sort of go-to-market distribution strategy, combining with Affiliates-focused team at their level with the endless scope and scale of a large institution with significant sort of expertise by geography or by channel to bring to bear [indiscernible] as they want it.

And in any given period, it's been half, sometimes more than half, and sometimes, of course, given the dynamics of a particular quarter, it's a less significant contribution. So I think the trend lines remain very much consistent and intact. As you heard Nate describe, we feel very good about our forward opportunity, especially -- I mean, ultimately it's fundamentally driven by the quality and performance of our Affiliates, but their distribution and our distribution, alongside theirs, is absolutely contributing to our continued organic growth.

There will be, of course, inevitable evolution, adaptation, growth in our distribution capabilities and strategy, but no fundamental change to the vision or strategy.

And we're trying to figure out how we can best partner with them as they evolve the way they bring their offering to market. I do think there's some other thing that I would add, which is, I think we're -- while we have a small share, we're relatively well positioned as you look at how those partners maybe evolving their businesses. So we don't really have brokerage. We're almost all in the advisory side. We have by and large the right kinds of share classes -- that will be attractive. And then importantly, and this picks up on a point made earlier, that we have -- this is a place where we can be enormously useful to our Affiliates, because having the scope and scale and breadth to be a good partner to -- while [indiscernible] as they go through their product rationalization may be very, very important.

And so those are the prices where you're seeing the pressure. But even in those areas, the strongest managers are both continuing to do well and continue to attract assets, and also will ultimately benefit from that evolution or shake out or what have you. And then again, as Sean said, the long-term thesis around attractiveness of these kinds of products in terms of the need for people to get them in their portfolio is, we think absolutely, intact."

So having AMG avail ourselves of a the global rate has lowered our both GAAP and cash rate.

We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase yea",803,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year. Our results reflect consistently strong execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of several new Affiliate investments during the quarter along with the continued excellent investment performance and strong positive net client cash flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe, we continue to see strong earnings growth ahead for AMG. 
We were pleased with our third quarter net client cash flows of $5.8 billion into our Affiliates actively-managed strategies during the quarter, particularly across an array of alternative products. As Nate will discuss, our net inflows were positive across each of our institutional, retail and high network channels and also across all client geographies. 
We believe that the quality of our independent boutique Affiliates and the unique breadth and diversity of our alpha product set have together driven the consistency of our organic growth results over the past 7 years. AMG has now generated net inflows in 24 of the last 26 quarters, including year-to-date net inflows of approximately $11.5 billion, notwithstanding continued muted industry-wide flows into actively managed products. 
The strength of our results reflect the success of our strategy of partnering with outstanding performance-driven boutiques and our focus on attractive alpha-oriented product areas, especially global and emerging market equities and a select set of alternative strategies. 
The best independent boutiques have meaningful competitive advantages in generating excess returns and value-added alpha-generating product areas, as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. Even in a period of growth in passive products on the back of cyclical and to some extent secular trends, select high-performing differentiated active equity and alternative managers will continue to generate organic growth and gain market share as evidenced by our long-term record of net inflows. In an environment of lower returns, clients around the world, from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors, recognize the importance of alpha generation in meeting their obligations and objectives. 
In seeking alpha, investors increasingly turn to differentiated high-conviction strategies. And given their focused and distinct investment approaches in the most attractive product areas, our Affiliates are positioned to benefit from this dynamic. We continue to see significant client demand for high-conviction active equity and alternative strategies across client geographies and channels. 
Through our long-term strategic focus on areas where boutiques excel and we see secular client demand trends, AMG has assembled one of the largest and most diverse books of alternative products in the industry focused on the product areas most attractive to clients. These strategies include both liquid and illiquid products and offer not only alpha, but also true diversification relative to traditional fixed income and equity markets, a feature increasingly valued by clients. 
We are already benefiting from growing client demand for these alternative strategies. And given our investments in some of the highest quality firms around the world which specialize in these areas, AMG is uniquely placed to continue to meet this enduring demand trend. AMG's array of alternative strategies is a strong complement to our outstanding equity offerings. And we believe that the advantages of our strategic position across our broad alternative product set will be increasingly evident. 
Turning to new investments. We continue to be well positioned to execute on our substantial forward opportunity set and further enhance the diversity and breadth of our performance-oriented product offering by partnering with leading independent firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG, and we're very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline, which includes both traditional and alternative firms. 
Looking ahead, AMG has a unique ability to make additional investments that are not only earnings accretive, but also add excellent new products with substantial capacity in defined areas where we see ongoing client demand. Given the outstanding opportunities we see to invest in excellent independent firms globally along with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we're well positioned for strong earnings growth going forward. 
Finally, I wanted to discuss the management change that we announced this morning. As you saw, Andrew Dyson is stepping down as Head of Global Distribution to take a CEO role at a subsidiary of Prudential Financial called QMA. Andrew has been a great friend and colleague over the past 5 years and has made a valuable contribution to AMG. We wish Andrew all the best in his new role.
As you would expect, we have a search underway and plan to move forward with a Head of Global Distribution early in 2017. With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates' results in more detail."

As Sean said, against the backdrop of muted industry demand for actively managed strategies, we generated strong net flows in the quarter across all 3 of our distribution channels. This continues our broadly positive flow results for the past 7 years, which ultimately stem from our Affiliates' excellent long-term investment performance and track record. 
In addition, as Sean said, we're also continuing to benefit from our strategic product positioning against some positive client demand trends; as well as our unique distribution of products, which includes each Affiliate's dedicated distribution capabilities complemented by AMG's global distribution efforts. While these flows have been remarkably consistent, positive in 24 of the last 26 quarters, for example, it is important to look at the long-term performance, long-term strategic positioning and our fundamental distribution strategy. As we regularly remind, flows, particularly in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy in any given quarter. So looking over a longer period provides a clearer picture. And on that basis, we continue to generate consistent positive net flow. 
Now picking up on a point Sean made, one of the most important drivers of our organic growth over the last several years has been our decision to increase our participation in alternative, and within alternative, the areas we've chosen to focus on. Through our active and consistent new investment activity and significant product development by our Affiliates, we're one of the largest managers of alternatives in the industry. While one key point is that our Affiliates manage a very diverse portfolio of alternative strategies across a wide range of investment categories, an equally important point is that we have substantial participation in the areas of alternatives that are in high demand from institutional and retail clients as they seek returns while also trying to diversify their allocations. 
Finally, we also see tremendous business diversification benefits from these high-quality alternative firms and products when they're coupled with our excellent traditional boutiques and products. 
Let me now turn to the performance in the alternatives category. Performance in the fixed income and equity relative value segment was strong, including positive performance from key products at AQR, BlueMountain, Capula and ValueAct. Results in our multi-strategy and multi-asset category was mixed. Risk-parity strategies generated strong returns in the quarter and year-to-date, while multi-asset-style premier at AQR was down slightly in the quarter. 
Within our systematic diversified category, this quarter was a challenging one for trend followers due to several sharp trend reversals. However, these strategies feature important diversification benefits at the overall client portfolio level, and we continue to see strong demand globally for the category. Because of their diversifying characteristics, we believe relative returns are a much more important determinant of client demand than absolute returns. And while it was down for the quarter, both AQR and Winton outperformed the trend-following indices while Systematica underperformed in the quarter. In addition, all 3 firms feature excellent performance over the long term. 
Our private equity and real assets, focused Affiliates and teams continue to put money to work and feature excellent long-term performance as well. And we see significant opportunities for firms like Pantheon, Baring Asia and EIG to continue to broaden and diversify their industry-leading investment platforms. 
As it relates to our public equity products, a  very strong risk on quarter across broad market indices saw outperformance from stocks that were typically higher risk and volatility as well as lower quality. Against that backdrop, the relative performance of our Affiliates, given this environment, was more mixed, as many of our Affiliates emphasize valuation and strong fundamentals in their investment processes.
Starting with the global developed markets category, we had good performance from flagship strategies at Harding Loevner and AQR, both of which delivered strong performance on an absolute and relative basis in the quarter, adding to their already strong long-term track record. Elsewhere, performance was more mixed at Artemis, while Tweedy, Browne's level of value underperformed, although it continues to have an industry-leading long-term track record. 
In the emerging markets category, all of our strategies were up on an absolute basis, but performance against the EM index was more mixed, with AQR and Trilogy emerging well with outperforming and Genesis and Harding Loevner trailing in the quarter. 
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, performance across our book of products was mixed in the quarter, although many of the larger strategies at firms such as Frontier and Systematic outperformed their indices in the quarter, as did the recently launched suite of U.S. equity products at our U.K. affiliate Artemis.
Now turning to flows for the quarter. Let me first reiterate the importance of looking at our flow trends over the longer term to understand our ability to drive organic growth. We've always said that in any given period our flows will be lumpy. And, if anything, the volatility has only increased in the current environment. Starting with the institutional channel, we had net inflows of $2.8 billion, with growth inflows again over $13 million. As I discussed earlier, we had especially strong growth in net flows in several parts of our alternatives books, including CTAs, multi-strategy and commodity. In our high net worth channel, we had net flows of $1 billion. Flows remained strong from separate accounts, both directly as well as through our wealth partners Affiliate. 
Speaking more broadly about our wealth partners business, last week we reached agreement to invest in a 6th wealth partner Affiliate, Forbes Family Trust. And when that investment closes, our wealth partners Affiliates will advise on a total of nearly $40 billion in assets. We're very excited about our investment in Forbes Family Trust, which is based in New York City and Philadelphia and provides outsourced CIO services as well as wealth advisory and planning to ultra-high net worth clients. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $2 billion. We saw mostly a continuation of the positive trends from the last few quarters in this channel. Asset class drivers were once again alternatives and emerging markets equities through firms such as AQR, GW&K and 
Harding Loevner, while we once again saw moderating outflows in our U.S. equities book. 
Looking ahead, our industry-leading array of high-quality equity and alternatives products features excellent long-term performance. While flows in any given period are volatile, we remain well positioned to generate positive organic growth through both our Affiliates own distribution as well as AMG's complementary global distribution platform. With that, let me turn it over to Jay to discuss our financials."
24445,407191352,1067503,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in the quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, inc",819,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in the quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, increasing the strength, diversity and earnings power of our business.
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.02 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.02. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. During the quarter, we updated our non-GAAP disclosures to rename EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA, but there was no change in the calculation of this performance measure. For the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $219.8 million, which did not include our recent new investments, given the one-quarter lag in reporting. The ratio of our adjusted EBITDA to end of period assets under management was 13.1 basis points, or 13 basis points excluding performance fees. In the fourth quarter we expect this ratio to increase to approximately 16 basis points, reflecting a higher performance fee contribution that we typically realize in the fourth quarter. 
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, reflecting a further decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate, and our cash tax rate was 19.7%. In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $19.5 million. We expect this number to increase to $21 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $84 million. Our share of reported amortization for the third quarter was $34.2 million, which includes $14 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the fourth quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to approximately $37 million as a result of recently closed new investment. And for the full year 2016, we expect our share of amortization to be approximately $143 million. 
Our share of interest expense for the third quarter was $22.4 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain approximately $22 million. And for the full year, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $88 million. Other economic items in the third quarter were $1.6 million. And for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the beginning of the third quarter, we closed our investment in Capula, which was partially funded with $150 million in forward equity proceeds. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we closed our investment in Winton, which we initially funded under the revolver. We expect to settle another $250 million in forward equity proceeds by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Given the scale and diversity of our business together with our flexible capital structure, we have successfully funded over $1.3 billion in new investments year-to-date. And looking ahead, the earnings power of our business has increased with the addition of Capula and Winton. Generating run rate EBITDA of over $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available at year-end, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we continue to execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance. We are leaving our 2016 and 2017 guidance unchanged. Our 2016 economic earnings per share range of $12.30 to $13.30 reflects market performance through last Friday, our current view of fourth quarter performance fees [indiscernible] and a weighted average share count of approximately $55 million for 2016. 
Our 2017 economic earnings per share range of $14 to $16 assumes the full year impact of Capula and Winton as well as the equity issuance under the Ford, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and each quarter thereafter and includes our normal model convention for share repurchases in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017.
The lower end of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution for performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flow. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earning. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations. 
Now we will be happy to answer any questions."

So as we said sort of in our prepared remarks, we feel really good about the underlying trends and activity levels. And so focusing on the institutional channel, the ones I'd call out is sort of the levels of RFP activity and then certainly levels of finals activity, which were really strong and actually up again this quarter. So good balanced activity in the third quarter. I think, as you say, it's hard to predict on sort of short-term, only 3 months, but I will say, looking to the fourth quarter, that's often kind of a seasonally weak quarter for us, and I think a couple of the reasons for that are we've got kind of the year-end redemptions from both quarterly and annual lock vehicles, and we've obviously got the distribution of performance fees that are earned during the year. So those put a little bit of a headwind in. And then in retail you'll often see people sort of reticent to buy ahead of kind of tax distributions and stuff. 
And then as I said in the prepared remarks, this year there's actually more volatility in flows than normal. I think that's due to the macro environment. So wouldn't be surprised if you also saw some retail slowdowns due to just macro stuff like the election. 
But that said, underlying and fundamentally, both with respect to the quarter and then sort of looking at that longer-term trend, as I said in the prepared remarks, institutional pipelines were really strong, and RFP activity is good. Finals activity continues to tick up. And then, if you look at the medium term, obviously we still think the trends -- there are some headwinds, obviously, but the trends we're benefiting from remain intact. So investors have to get returns into their portfolios. We do think people will continue to barbell between sort of passive on the one side and then return oriented on the other. And our Affiliates are really well positioned to compete for and win those mandates and take share."

When we launched our distribution strategy 15 years ago, the core vision was to offer Affiliates the benefit of scale and institutional, especially global institutional and retail markets on a basis that was bespoke, that suited for them and complementary to each of their own distribution strategies and efforts. 
We established our U.S. retail platform in 2004 and opened our first non-U.S. institutional distribution office a couple years later in Australia. In fact, in a few weeks I'll be in Sydney celebrating the 10th anniversary of our office founding. 
Andrew has been a valued member of our team for sure since he joined 5 years ago. But our strategic vision, commitment to the business remain completely consistent. And remember, for clients, we're providing a unique offering where the clients, especially global institutional clients but increasingly retail clients, get the benefit of the focused expertise of industry-leading specialist firms combined with or backed by the scale, resources and operational risk management of a global franchise. And they get, especially in these far-flung markets, the benefit of in-market client service and a single point of access to this very broad array of many of the industry's best boutique firms. 
And if you want any demonstration of or validation of the effectiveness of this strategy, you have only to look at the success that we've had over the past 7 years. As you know, 24 out of the past 26 quarters strong, positive flows in our active equity and alternative product set. It's a record that we'd compare to any in the industry.

And as you've said, we did leave guidance unchanged, primarily because the impact from market beta was only modest. It will only have a modest impact on the fourth quarter, as you would expect, given that we're 3/4 of the way through the year. 
But just on the components, when we last gave guidance, which was August 1st, our market blend at that time was 2% up from the prior transcript. As you can see from our AUM tables, we experienced approximately 3.1% in market changes, which included FX. I put those 2 numbers together for the entire quarter. So 3.1% versus the 2% that we knew about. It had a positive impact of 1.1% relative to the last time we gave guidance going through the end of the quarter. So that was through the end of the third quarter. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, though, we have seen markets, including FX, off about 1.5%. So it took that positive 1% one down to a negative 0.5%. 
I think the other thing that you're probably aware of is that when we remove our 2% market growth assumption for the fourth quarter, relative to our model that has a negative impact. So really down 2.5% from the model. 
All that being said, though, given it's the fourth quarter, it will only have a small impact on '16. So we left guidance unchanged because, setting markets aside, our 2016 range is primarily a judgment on performance fees, as you had mentioned. And when we look at various performance fee scenarios for the remainder of the year, both up and down scenarios, we have considered a few lumpy performance fees as well as the timing between 2016 and 2017 realizations in certain products. So considering all of that, that's why we left the range unchanged. 
Just to remind you of a couple of other items for 2016, there is a quarter lag in the financial reporting for capital in Winton, so we saw no impact of capital in this quarter other than the funding of Capula. We will see an impact in the fourth quarter with Capula being included, but we will not see Winton till next year. 
Second, we will assume no more -- for model purposes, no more share repurchases for 2016. None of these items will affect '17. So we'll have the full effect of Winton and Capula and we'll return to our normal model guidance. 
And then lastly, just to touch on 2017, even though we removed the 2% market and we were down a little bit quarter-to-date, we feel comfortable that our 2017 guidance range still captures our forward opportunity set, especially since we have a full year of both Capula and Winton in the numbers for next year. We also have included the full year effect of the $400 million of equity. $150 million has already been issued, $250 million in the fourth quarter. And reminding you of our model convention again, all of these numbers are included in our 56 million share count, average weighted share count for 2017. 
And then finally, just on performance fee expectations for next year, with the addition of Winton and Capula as well as just the broad diversity within our performance fee opportunity, we see kind of mid-teens at the midpoint of the guidance range for next year in terms of performance fee contribution."

I would say the theme is to sort of think about on the institutional flow side for the quarter, and then maybe I'll talk a little bit going -- looking forward. As we touched on in our prepared remarks, there were significantly higher gross sales in alternatives. AQR is a contributor there, but it was AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon. It was a number of firms that contributed significantly there. Also, we had relatively lower redemption rates in alternatives. So that was sort of -- the alternatives category did quite well. We also saw an uptick in gross sales in U.S. equities, and sort of same thing, sort of a moderating alpha in U.S. equities. So I think it was a couple things there. 
I've talked already about sort of fourth quarter and some of the seasonality there, but I think, again, the main thing to focus on is, as you look forward in the institution channel, is the trends that we think we've been benefiting from, put the headwinds aside for a second, those remain intact. And it's how do people get returns into portfolios, it's how do people continue to barbell passive and active and how well-positioned we are to compete for those active allocations, right? 
We have a large number of very good performing product in high demand areas, global and emerging markets and alternatives, as we've talked about.

So I'll try to address some, and then Nate, I'll ask you to fill in. 
The distribute -- the contribution to our flows from ""AMG distribution"" varies quarter-to-quarter, and we don't track it in a direct way because a lot of the influence is going to be in indirect ways. So I would say over time it is, in aggregate over the past 6, 7 years, about $50 billion in incremental contribution at least. And in any given period it's been half, sometimes more than half. And sometimes, of course, given the dynamics of a particular quarter, it's a less significant contribution. 
So I think the trend lines remain very much consistent and intact. As you heard Nate describe, we feel very good about our forward opportunity, especially, I mean ultimately, fundamentally driven by the quality and performance of our Affiliates. But their distribution and our distribution, alongside theirs, is absolutely contributing to our continued organic growth. 
Looking ahead, as I said, we see no change. There will be, of course, inevitable evolution, adaptation, growth in our distribution capabilities and strategy, but no fundamental change to the vision or strategy. We're looking for a -- and I'm very confident we'll find a very high quality, experienced, driven, motivated person who is a cultural fit with our team and of course with our Affiliates and our overall corporate philosophy. So quite confident that we'll complete a search in a very expeditious way with somebody who we're enthusiastic to have join the AMG team.

So first, I think as we've said before, we don't believe that the DoL fiduciary rules will have a significant direct impact on our business. And all of our Affiliates that are interactive with retirement investors are already fiduciaries. And frankly, and this is -- goes beyond the direct use, frankly, the retirement area is actually one, on our U.S. side, is a part of our business that is relatively modest and is actually an area, as we sort of look out over the medium to long term, an area we should be able to really grow. 
I do think -- look, the other thing I think we've also said before is, we're probably doing much the same thing as many other people similarly situated, which is we're trying to help our distribution partner as the people that we work through and we're trying to figure out how we can best partner with them as they evolve the way they bring their offering to market. 
I do think there's some other things I'd add, which is, I think we're -- while we have a small share, we're relatively well positioned as you look at how those partners may be evolving their businesses. So we don't really have brokerage. We're almost all in the advisory side. We have by and large the right kinds of share classes to -- that will be attractive. 
And then importantly, and this picks up on a point Sean made earlier, we have -- this is a place where we can be enormously useful to our Affiliates, because having the scope and scale and breadth to be a good partner, to [indiscernible] as they go through their product rationalization may be very, very important. So again, it's not a direct impact, and the retirement piece is a small, relatively small part of our business today. And while there will be a bunch of sort of noise and work as we go through this, I do think there are opportunities on the kind of medium to long term for us to partner well with our channel partners."

I think the point I'd make, and this is consistent with the point Sean was just making, which is, look, the pressure is coming when you have poor returns in a space that's relatively crowded, even if people want that space. And so those are the places where you're seeing the pressure. But even in those areas, the strongest managers are both continuing to do well and continue to attract assets and then also will ultimately benefit from that evolution or shake-out or what have you. And then again, as Sean said, the long-term thesis around the attractiveness of these kinds of products in terms of the need for people to get them in their portfolio is, we think, absolutely intact."

It is a structural change, and that structural change is because of new investments offshore. We spent some money offshore, and the effect of non-U.S. corporate taxes are lower than U.S. corporate taxes. So having AMG avail ourselves of a global rate has lowered our both GAAP and cash rate.

We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase yea",803,"Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year. Our results reflect consistently strong execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of several new Affiliate investments during the quarter along with the continued excellent investment performance and strong positive net client cash flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe, we continue to see strong earnings growth ahead for AMG. 
We were pleased with our third quarter net client cash flows of $5.8 billion into our Affiliates actively-managed strategies during the quarter, particularly across an array of alternative products. As Nate will discuss, our net inflows were positive across each of our institutional, retail and high network channels and also across all client geographies. 
We believe that the quality of our independent boutique Affiliates and the unique breadth and diversity of our alpha product set have together driven the consistency of our organic growth results over the past 7 years. AMG has now generated net inflows in 24 of the last 26 quarters, including year-to-date net inflows of approximately $11.5 billion, notwithstanding continued muted industry-wide flows into actively managed products. 
The strength of our results reflect the success of our strategy of partnering with outstanding performance-driven boutiques and our focus on attractive alpha-oriented product areas, especially global and emerging market equities and a select set of alternative strategies. 
The best independent boutiques have meaningful competitive advantages in generating excess returns and value-added alpha-generating product areas, as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. Even in a period of growth in passive products on the back of cyclical and to some extent secular trends, select high-performing differentiated active equity and alternative managers will continue to generate organic growth and gain market share as evidenced by our long-term record of net inflows. In an environment of lower returns, clients around the world, from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors, recognize the importance of alpha generation in meeting their obligations and objectives. 
In seeking alpha, investors increasingly turn to differentiated high-conviction strategies. And given their focused and distinct investment approaches in the most attractive product areas, our Affiliates are positioned to benefit from this dynamic. We continue to see significant client demand for high-conviction active equity and alternative strategies across client geographies and channels. 
Through our long-term strategic focus on areas where boutiques excel and we see secular client demand trends, AMG has assembled one of the largest and most diverse books of alternative products in the industry focused on the product areas most attractive to clients. These strategies include both liquid and illiquid products and offer not only alpha, but also true diversification relative to traditional fixed income and equity markets, a feature increasingly valued by clients. 
We are already benefiting from growing client demand for these alternative strategies. And given our investments in some of the highest quality firms around the world which specialize in these areas, AMG is uniquely placed to continue to meet this enduring demand trend. AMG's array of alternative strategies is a strong complement to our outstanding equity offerings. And we believe that the advantages of our strategic position across our broad alternative product set will be increasingly evident. 
Turning to new investments. We continue to be well positioned to execute on our substantial forward opportunity set and further enhance the diversity and breadth of our performance-oriented product offering by partnering with leading independent firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG, and we're very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline, which includes both traditional and alternative firms. 
Looking ahead, AMG has a unique ability to make additional investments that are not only earnings accretive, but also add excellent new products with substantial capacity in defined areas where we see ongoing client demand. Given the outstanding opportunities we see to invest in excellent independent firms globally along with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we're well positioned for strong earnings growth going forward. 
Finally, I wanted to discuss the management change that we announced this morning. As you saw, Andrew Dyson is stepping down as Head of Global Distribution to take a CEO role at a subsidiary of Prudential Financial called QMA. Andrew has been a great friend and colleague over the past 5 years and has made a valuable contribution to AMG. We wish Andrew all the best in his new role.
As you would expect, we have a search underway and plan to move forward with a Head of Global Distribution early in 2017. With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates' results in more detail."
24445,407191352,1067598,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone.

As Sean said, against the backdrop of muted industry demand for actively managed strategies, we generated strong net flows in the quarter across all 3 of our distribution channels. This continues our broadly positive flow results for the past 7 years, which ultimately stem from our Affiliates' excellent long-term investment performance and track record. 
In addition, as Sean said, we're also continuing to benefit from our strategic product positioning against some positive client demand trends; as well as our unique distribution of products, which includes each Affiliate's dedicated distribution capabilities complemented by AMG's global distribution efforts. While these flows have been remarkably consistent, positive in 24 of the last 26 quarters, for example, it is important to look at the long-term performance, long-term strategic positioning and our fundamental distribution strategy. As we regularly remind, flows, particularly in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy in any given quarter. So looking over a longer period provides a clearer picture. And on that basis, we continue to generate consistent positive net flow. 
Now picking up on a point Sean made, one of the most important drivers of our organic growth over the last several years has been our decision to increase our participation in alternative, and within alternative, the areas we've chosen to focus on. Through our active and consistent new investment activity and significant product development by our Affiliates, we're one of the largest managers of alternatives in the industry. While one key point is that our Affiliates manage a very diverse portfolio of alternative strategies across a wide range of investment categories, an equally important point is that we have substantial participation in the areas of alternatives that are in high demand from institutional and retail clients as they seek returns while also trying to diversify their allocations. 
Finally, we also see tremendous business diversification benefits from these high-quality alternative firms and products when they're coupled with our excellent traditional boutiques and products. 
Let me now turn to the performance in the alternatives category. Performance in the fixed income and equity relative value segment was strong, including positive performance from key products at AQR, BlueMountain, Capula and ValueAct. Results in our multi-strategy and multi-asset category was mixed. Risk-parity strategies generated strong returns in the quarter and year-to-date, while multi-asset-style premier at AQR was down slightly in the quarter. 
Within our systematic diversified category, this quarter was a challenging one for trend followers due to several sharp trend reversals. However, these strategies feature important diversification benefits at the overall client portfolio level, and we continue to see strong demand globally for the category. Because of their diversifying characteristics, we believe relative returns are a much more important determinant of client demand than absolute returns. And while it was down for the quarter, both AQR and Winton outperformed the trend-following indices while Systematica underperformed in the quarter. In addition, all 3 firms feature excellent performance over the long term. 
Our private equity and real assets, focused Affiliates and teams continue to put money to work and feature excellent long-term performance as well. And we see significant opportunities for firms like Pantheon, Baring Asia and EIG to continue to broaden and diversify their industry-leading investment platforms. 
As it relates to our public equity products, a  very strong risk on quarter across broad market indices saw outperformance from stocks that were typically higher risk and volatility as well as lower quality. Against that backdrop, the relative performance of our Affiliates, given this environment, was more mixed, as many of our Affiliates emphasize valuation and strong fundamentals in their investment processes.
Starting with the global developed markets category, we had good performance from flagship strategies at Harding Loevner and AQR, both of which delivered strong performance on an absolute and relative basis in the quarter, adding to their already strong long-term track record. Elsewhere, performance was more mixed at Artemis, while Tweedy, Browne's level of value underperformed, although it continues to have an industry-leading long-term track record. 
In the emerging markets category, all of our strategies were up on an absolute basis, but performance against the EM index was more mixed, with AQR and Trilogy emerging well with outperforming and Genesis and Harding Loevner trailing in the quarter. 
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, performance across our book of products was mixed in the quarter, although many of the larger strategies at firms such as Frontier and Systematic outperformed their indices in the quarter, as did the recently launched suite of U.S. equity products at our U.K. affiliate Artemis.
Now turning to flows for the quarter. Let me first reiterate the importance of looking at our flow trends over the longer term to understand our ability to drive organic growth. We've always said that in any given period our flows will be lumpy. And, if anything, the volatility has only increased in the current environment. Starting with the institutional channel, we had net inflows of $2.8 billion, with growth inflows again over $13 million. As I discussed earlier, we had especially strong growth in net flows in several parts of our alternatives books, including CTAs, multi-strategy and commodity. In our high net worth channel, we had net flows of $1 billion. Flows remained strong from separate accounts, both directly as well as through our wealth partners Affiliate. 
Speaking more broadly about our wealth partners business, last week we reached agreement to invest in a 6th wealth partner Affiliate, Forbes Family Trust. And when that investment closes, our wealth partners Affiliates will advise on a total of nearly $40 billion in assets. We're very excited about our investment in Forbes Family Trust, which is based in New York City and Philadelphia and provides outsourced CIO services as well as wealth advisory and planning to ultra-high net worth clients. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $2 billion. We saw mostly a continuation of the positive trends from the last few quarters in this channel. Asset class drivers were once again alternatives and emerging markets equities through firms such as AQR, GW&K and 
Harding Loevner, while we once again saw moderating outflows in our U.S. equities book. 
Looking ahead, our industry-leading array of high-quality equity and alternatives products features excellent long-term performance. While flows in any given period are volatile, we remain well positioned to generate positive organic growth through both our Affiliates own distribution as well as AMG's complementary global distribution platform. With that, let me turn it over to Jay to discuss our financials."

As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in the quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, increasing the strength, diversity and earnings power of our business.
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.02 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.02. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. During the quarter, we updated our non-GAAP disclosures to rename EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA, but there was no change in the calculation of this performance measure. For the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $219.8 million, which did not include our recent new investments, given the one-quarter lag in reporting. The ratio of our adjusted EBITDA to end of period assets under management was 13.1 basis points, or 13 basis points excluding performance fees. In the fourth quarter we expect this ratio to increase to approximately 16 basis points, reflecting a higher performance fee contribution that we typically realize in the fourth quarter. 
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, reflecting a further decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate, and our cash tax rate was 19.7%. In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $19.5 million. We expect this number to increase to $21 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $84 million. Our share of reported amortization for the third quarter was $34.2 million, which includes $14 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the fourth quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to approximately $37 million as a result of recently closed new investment. And for the full year 2016, we expect our share of amortization to be approximately $143 million. 
Our share of interest expense for the third quarter was $22.4 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain approximately $22 million. And for the full year, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $88 million. Other economic items in the third quarter were $1.6 million. And for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the beginning of the third quarter, we closed our investment in Capula, which was partially funded with $150 million in forward equity proceeds. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we closed our investment in Winton, which we initially funded under the revolver. We expect to settle another $250 million in forward equity proceeds by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Given the scale and diversity of our business together with our flexible capital structure, we have successfully funded over $1.3 billion in new investments year-to-date. And looking ahead, the earnings power of our business has increased with the addition of Capula and Winton. Generating run rate EBITDA of over $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available at year-end, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we continue to execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance. We are leaving our 2016 and 2017 guidance unchanged. Our 2016 economic earnings per share range of $12.30 to $13.30 reflects market performance through last Friday, our current view of fourth quarter performance fees [indiscernible] and a weighted average share count of approximately $55 million for 2016. 
Our 2017 economic earnings per share range of $14 to $16 assumes the full year impact of Capula and Winton as well as the equity issuance under the Ford, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and each quarter thereafter and includes our normal model convention for share repurchases in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017.
The lower end of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution for performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flow. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earning. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations. 
Now we will be happy to answer any questions."

So as we said sort of in our prepared remarks, we feel really good about the underlying trends and activity levels. And so focusing on the institutional channel, the ones I'd call out is sort of the levels of RFP activity and then certainly levels of finals activity, which were really strong and actually up again this quarter. So good balanced activity in the third quarter. I think, as you say, it's hard to predict on sort of short-term, only 3 months, but I will say, looking to the fourth quarter, that's often kind of a seasonally weak quarter for us, and I think a couple of the reasons for that are we've got kind of the year-end redemptions from both quarterly and annual lock vehicles, and we've obviously got the distribution of performance fees that are earned during the year. So those put a little bit of a headwind in. And then in retail you'll often see people sort of reticent to buy ahead of kind of tax distributions and stuff. 
And then as I said in the prepared remarks, this year there's actually more volatility in flows than normal. I think that's due to the macro environment. So wouldn't be surprised if you also saw some retail slowdowns due to just macro stuff like the election. 
But that said, underlying and fundamentally, both with respect to the quarter and then sort of looking at that longer-term trend, as I said in the prepared remarks, institutional pipelines were really strong, and RFP activity is good. Finals activity continues to tick up. And then, if you look at the medium term, obviously we still think the trends -- there are some headwinds, obviously, but the trends we're benefiting from remain intact. So investors have to get returns into their portfolios. We do think people will continue to barbell between sort of passive on the one side and then return oriented on the other. And our Affiliates are really well positioned to compete for and win those mandates and take share."

When we launched our distribution strategy 15 years ago, the core vision was to offer Affiliates the benefit of scale and institutional, especially global institutional and retail markets on a basis that was bespoke, that suited for them and complementary to each of their own distribution strategies and efforts. 
We established our U.S. retail platform in 2004 and opened our first non-U.S. institutional distribution office a couple years later in Australia. In fact, in a few weeks I'll be in Sydney celebrating the 10th anniversary of our office founding. 
Andrew has been a valued member of our team for sure since he joined 5 years ago. But our strategic vision, commitment to the business remain completely consistent. And remember, for clients, we're providing a unique offering where the clients, especially global institutional clients but increasingly retail clients, get the benefit of the focused expertise of industry-leading specialist firms combined with or backed by the scale, resources and operational risk management of a global franchise. And they get, especially in these far-flung markets, the benefit of in-market client service and a single point of access to this very broad array of many of the industry's best boutique firms. 
And if you want any demonstration of or validation of the effectiveness of this strategy, you have only to look at the success that we've had over the past 7 years. As you know, 24 out of the past 26 quarters strong, positive flows in our active equity and alternative product set. It's a record that we'd compare to any in the industry. 
Sorry, the one other question that you asked is when you'll get an announcement, and I think in my prepared remarks I said early 2017. And I think I'm going to stick with that. Thanks, Craig."

And as you've said, we did leave guidance unchanged, primarily because the impact from market beta was only modest. It will only have a modest impact on the fourth quarter, as you would expect, given that we're 3/4 of the way through the year. 
But just on the components, when we last gave guidance, which was August 1st, our market blend at that time was 2% up from the prior transcript. As you can see from our AUM tables, we experienced approximately 3.1% in market changes, which included FX. I put those 2 numbers together for the entire quarter. So 3.1% versus the 2% that we knew about. It had a positive impact of 1.1% relative to the last time we gave guidance going through the end of the quarter. So that was through the end of the third quarter. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, though, we have seen markets, including FX, off about 1.5%. So it took that positive 1% down to a negative 0.5%. 
I think the other thing that you're probably aware of is that when we remove our 2% market growth assumption for the fourth quarter, relative to our model that has a negative impact. So really down 2.5% from the model. 
All that being said, though, given it's the fourth quarter, it will only have a small impact on '16. So we left guidance unchanged because, setting markets aside, our 2016 range is primarily a judgment on performance fees, as you had mentioned. And when we look at various performance fee scenarios for the remainder of the year, both up and down scenarios, we have considered a few lumpy performance fees as well as the timing between 2016 and 2017 realizations in certain products. So considering all of that, that's why we left the range unchanged. 
Just to remind you of a couple of other items for 2016, there is a quarter lag in the financial reporting for capital in Winton, so we saw no impact of capital in this quarter other than the funding of Capula. We will see an impact in the fourth quarter with Capula being included, but we will not see Winton till next year. 
Second, we will assume no more -- for model purposes, no more share repurchases for 2016. None of these items will affect '17. So we'll have the full effect of Winton and Capula and we'll return to our normal model guidance. 
And then lastly, just to touch on 2017, even though we removed the 2% market and we were down a little bit quarter-to-date, we feel comfortable that our 2017 guidance range still captures our forward opportunity set, especially since we have a full year of both Capula and Winton in the numbers for next year. We also have included the full year effect of the $400 million of equity. $150 million has already been issued, $250 million in the fourth quarter. And reminding you of our model convention again, all of these numbers are included in our 56 million share count, average weighted share count for 2017. 
And then finally, just on performance fee expectations for next year, with the addition of Winton and Capula as well as just the broad diversity within our performance fee opportunity, we see kind of mid-teens at the midpoint of the guidance range for next year in terms of performance fee contribution."

It was a number of firms that contributed significantly there. Also, we had relatively lower redemption rates in alternatives. So that was sort of -- the alternatives category did quite well. We also saw an uptick in gross sales in U.S. equities, and sort of same thing, sort of a moderating alpha in U.S. equities. So I think it was a couple things there. 
I've talked already about sort of fourth quarter and some of the seasonality there, but I think, again, the main thing to focus on is, as you look forward in the institution channel, is the trends that we think we've been benefiting from, put the headwinds aside for a second, those remain intact. And it's how do people get returns into portfolios, it's how do people continue to barbell passive and active and how well-positioned we are to compete for those active allocations, right?

The distribute -- the contribution to our flows from ""AMG distribution"" varies quarter-to-quarter, and we don't track it in a direct way because a lot of the influence is going to be in indirect ways. So I would say over time it is, in aggregate over the past 6, 7 years, about $50 billion in incremental contribution at least. And in any given period it's been half, sometimes more than half. And sometimes, of course, given the dynamics of a particular quarter, it's a less significant contribution. 
So I think the trend lines remain very much consistent and intact. As you heard Nate describe, we feel very good about our forward opportunity, especially, I mean ultimately, fundamentally driven by the quality and performance of our Affiliates. But their distribution and our distribution, alongside theirs, is absolutely contributing to our continued organic growth.

And all of our Affiliates that are interactive with retirement investors are already fiduciaries. And frankly, and this is -- goes beyond the direct use, frankly, the retirement area is actually one, on our U.S. side, is a part of our business that is relatively modest and is actually an area, as we sort of look out over the medium to long term, an area we should be able to really grow. 
I do think -- look, the other thing I think we've also said before is, we're probably doing much the same thing as many other people similarly situated, which is we're trying to help our distribution partner as the people that we work through and we're trying to figure out how we can best partner with them as they evolve the way they bring their offering to market. 
I do think there's some other things I'd add, which is, I think we're -- while we have a small share, we're relatively well positioned as you look at how those partners may be evolving their businesses. So we don't really have brokerage. We're almost all in the advisory side. We have by and large the right kinds of share classes to -- that will be attractive. 
And then importantly, and this picks up on a point Sean made earlier, we have -- this is a place where we can be enormously useful to our Affiliates, because having the scope and scale and breadth to be a good partner, to [indiscernible] as they go through their product rationalization may be very, very important. So again, it's not a direct impact, and the retirement piece is a small, relatively small part of our business today.

I think the point I'd make, and this is consistent with the point Sean was just making, which is, look, the pressure is coming when you have poor returns in a space that's relatively crowded, even if people want that space. And so those are the places where you're seeing the pressure. But even in those areas, the strongest managers are both continuing to do well and continue to attract assets and then also will ultimately benefit from that evolution or shake-out or what have you. And then again, as Sean said, the long-term thesis around the attractiveness of these kinds of products in terms of the need for people to get them in their portfolio is, we think, absolutely intact."

It is a structural change, and that structural change is because of new investments offshore. We spent some money offshore, and the effect of non-U.S. corporate taxes are lower than U.S. corporate taxes. So having AMG avail ourselves of a global rate has lowered our both GAAP and cash rate. For the moment, I think that level of 33% GAAP and 20% cash going forward is the right rate to consider. But that is certainly down year-over-year and over the last 3 years."

We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year. Our results reflect consistently strong execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of several new Affiliate investments during the quarter along with the continued excellent investment performance and strong positive net client cash flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe, we continue to see strong earnings growth ahead for AMG. 
We were pleased with our third quarter net client cash flows of $5.8 billion into our Affiliates actively-managed strategies during the quarter, particularly across an array of alternative products. As Nate will discuss, our net inflows were positive across each of our institutional, retail and high network channels and also across all client geographies. 
We believe that the quality of our independent boutique Affiliates and the unique breadth and diversity of our alpha product set have together driven the consistency of our organic growth results over the past 7 years. AMG has now generated net inflows in 24 of the last 26 quarters, including year-to-date net inflows of approximately $11.5 billion, notwithstanding continued muted industry-wide flows into actively managed products. 
The strength of our results reflect the success of our strategy of partnering with outstanding performance-driven boutiques and our focus on attractive alpha-oriented product areas, especially global and emerging market equities and a select set of alternative strategies. 
The best independent boutiques have meaningful competitive advantages in generating excess returns and value-added alpha-generating product areas, as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates. Even in a period of growth in passive products on the back of cyclical and to some extent secular trends, select high-performing differentiated active equity and alternative managers will continue to generate organic growth and gain market share as evidenced by our long-term record of net inflows. In an environment of lower returns, clients around the world, from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors, recognize the importance of alpha generation in meeting their obligations and objectives. 
In seeking alpha, investors increasingly turn to differentiated high-conviction strategies. And given their focused and distinct investment approaches in the most attractive product areas, our Affiliates are positioned to benefit from this dynamic. We continue to see significant client demand for high-conviction active equity and alternative strategies across client geographies and channels. 
Through our long-term strategic focus on areas where boutiques excel and we see secular client demand trends, AMG has assembled one of the largest and most diverse books of alternative products in the industry focused on the product areas most attractive to clients. These strategies include both liquid and illiquid products and offer not only alpha, but also true diversification relative to traditional fixed income and equity markets, a feature increasingly valued by clients. 
We are already benefiting from growing client demand for these alternative strategies. And given our investments in some of the highest quality firms around the world which specialize in these areas, AMG is uniquely placed to continue to meet this enduring demand trend. AMG's array of alternative strategies is a strong complement to our outstanding equity offerings. And we believe that the advantages of our strategic position across our broad alternative product set will be increasingly evident. 
Turning to new investments. We continue to be well positioned to execute on our substantial forward opportunity set and further enhance the diversity and breadth of our performance-oriented product offering by partnering with leading independent firms around the world. The transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG, and we're very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline, which includes both traditional and alternative firms. 
Looking ahead, AMG has a unique ability to make additional investments that are not only earnings accretive, but also add excellent new products with substantial capacity in defined areas where we see ongoing client demand. Given the outstanding opportunities we see to invest in excellent independent firms globally along with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we're well positioned for strong earnings growth going forward. 
Finally, I wanted to discuss the management change that we announced this morning. As you saw, Andrew Dyson is stepping down as Head of Global Distribution to take a CEO role at a subsidiary of Prudential Financial called QMA. Andrew has been a great friend and colleague over the past 5 years and has made a valuable contribution to AMG. We wish Andrew all the best in his new role.
As you would expect, we have a search underway and plan to move forward with a Head of Global Distribution early in 2017. With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates' results in more detail."
24445,407191352,1067739,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone.

As Sean said, against the backdrop of muted industry demand for actively managed strategies, we generated strong net flows in the quarter across all 3 of our distribution channels. This continues our broadly positive flow results for the past 7 years, which ultimately stem from our Affiliates' excellent long-term investment performance and track record. 
In addition, as Sean said, we're also continuing to benefit from our strategic product positioning against some positive client demand trends; as well as our unique distribution of products, which includes each Affiliate's dedicated distribution capabilities complemented by AMG's global distribution efforts. While these flows have been remarkably consistent, positive in 24 of the last 26 quarters, for example, it is important to look at the long-term performance, long-term strategic positioning and our fundamental distribution strategy. As we regularly remind, flows, particularly in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy in any given quarter. So looking over a longer period provides a clearer picture. And on that basis, we continue to generate consistent positive net flow. 
Now picking up on a point Sean made, one of the most important drivers of our organic growth over the last several years has been our decision to increase our participation in alternative, and within alternative, the areas we've chosen to focus on. Through our active and consistent new investment activity and significant product development by our Affiliates, we're one of the largest managers of alternatives in the industry. While one key point is that our Affiliates manage a very diverse portfolio of alternative strategies across a wide range of investment categories, an equally important point is that we have substantial participation in the areas of alternatives that are in high demand from institutional and retail clients as they seek returns while also trying to diversify their allocations. 
Finally, we also see tremendous business diversification benefits from these high-quality alternative firms and products when they're coupled with our excellent traditional boutiques and products. 
Let me now turn to the performance in the alternatives category. Performance in the fixed income and equity relative value segment was strong, including positive performance from key products at AQR, BlueMountain, Capula and ValueAct. Results in our multi-strategy and multi-asset category was mixed. Risk-parity strategies generated strong returns in the quarter and year-to-date, while multi-asset-style premier at AQR was down slightly in the quarter. 
Within our systematic diversified category, this quarter was a challenging one for trend followers due to several sharp trend reversals. However, these strategies feature important diversification benefits at the overall client portfolio level, and we continue to see strong demand globally for the category. Because of their diversifying characteristics, we believe relative returns are a much more important determinant of client demand than absolute returns. And while it was down for the quarter, both AQR and Winton outperformed the trend-following indices while Systematica underperformed in the quarter. In addition, all 3 firms feature excellent performance over the long term. 
Our private equity and real assets, focused Affiliates and teams continue to put money to work and feature excellent long-term performance as well. And we see significant opportunities for firms like Pantheon, Baring Asia and EIG to continue to broaden and diversify their industry-leading investment platforms. 
As it relates to our public equity products, a  very strong risk on quarter across broad market indices saw outperformance from stocks that were typically higher risk and volatility as well as lower quality. Against that backdrop, the relative performance of our Affiliates, given this environment, was more mixed, as many of our Affiliates emphasize valuation and strong fundamentals in their investment processes.
Starting with the global developed markets category, we had good performance from flagship strategies at Harding Loevner and AQR, both of which delivered strong performance on an absolute and relative basis in the quarter, adding to their already strong long-term track record. Elsewhere, performance was more mixed at Artemis, while Tweedy, Browne's level of value underperformed, although it continues to have an industry-leading long-term track record. 
In the emerging markets category, all of our strategies were up on an absolute basis, but performance against the EM index was more mixed, with AQR and Trilogy emerging well with outperforming and Genesis and Harding Loevner trailing in the quarter. 
Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, performance across our book of products was mixed in the quarter, although many of the larger strategies at firms such as Frontier and Systematic outperformed their indices in the quarter, as did the recently launched suite of U.S. equity products at our U.K. affiliate Artemis.
Now turning to flows for the quarter. Let me first reiterate the importance of looking at our flow trends over the longer term to understand our ability to drive organic growth. We've always said that in any given period our flows will be lumpy. And, if anything, the volatility has only increased in the current environment. Starting with the institutional channel, we had net inflows of $2.8 billion, with growth inflows again over $13 million. As I discussed earlier, we had especially strong growth in net flows in several parts of our alternatives books, including CTAs, multi-strategy and commodity. In our high net worth channel, we had net flows of $1 billion. Flows remained strong from separate accounts, both directly as well as through our wealth partners Affiliate. 
Speaking more broadly about our wealth partners business, last week we reached agreement to invest in a 6th wealth partner Affiliate, Forbes Family Trust. And when that investment closes, our wealth partners Affiliates will advise on a total of nearly $40 billion in assets. We're very excited about our investment in Forbes Family Trust, which is based in New York City and Philadelphia and provides outsourced CIO services as well as wealth advisory and planning to ultra-high net worth clients. 
In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $2 billion. We saw mostly a continuation of the positive trends from the last few quarters in this channel. Asset class drivers were once again alternatives and emerging markets equities through firms such as AQR, GW&K and 
Harding Loevner, while we once again saw moderating outflows in our U.S. equities book. 
Looking ahead, our industry-leading array of high-quality equity and alternatives products features excellent long-term performance. While flows in any given period are volatile, we remain well positioned to generate positive organic growth through both our Affiliates own distribution as well as AMG's complementary global distribution platform. With that, let me turn it over to Jay to discuss our financials."
24445,407191352,1067739,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in the quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, inc",819,"Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in the quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, increasing the strength, diversity and earnings power of our business.
As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.02 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.02. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2. 
Turning to more specific modeling items. During the quarter, we updated our non-GAAP disclosures to rename EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA, but there was no change in the calculation of this performance measure. For the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $219.8 million, which did not include our recent new investments, given the one-quarter lag in reporting. The ratio of our adjusted EBITDA to end of period assets under management was 13.1 basis points, or 13 basis points excluding performance fees. In the fourth quarter we expect this ratio to increase to approximately 16 basis points, reflecting a higher performance fee contribution that we typically realize in the fourth quarter. 
With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, reflecting a further decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate, and our cash tax rate was 19.7%. In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%.
Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $19.5 million. We expect this number to increase to $21 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $84 million. Our share of reported amortization for the third quarter was $34.2 million, which includes $14 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the fourth quarter, we expect our share of amortization to increase to approximately $37 million as a result of recently closed new investment. And for the full year 2016, we expect our share of amortization to be approximately $143 million. 
Our share of interest expense for the third quarter was $22.4 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain approximately $22 million. And for the full year, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $88 million. Other economic items in the third quarter were $1.6 million. And for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. At the beginning of the third quarter, we closed our investment in Capula, which was partially funded with $150 million in forward equity proceeds. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we closed our investment in Winton, which we initially funded under the revolver. We expect to settle another $250 million in forward equity proceeds by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Given the scale and diversity of our business together with our flexible capital structure, we have successfully funded over $1.3 billion in new investments year-to-date. And looking ahead, the earnings power of our business has increased with the addition of Capula and Winton. Generating run rate EBITDA of over $1 billion, along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available at year-end, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we continue to execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.
Now turning to guidance. We are leaving our 2016 and 2017 guidance unchanged. Our 2016 economic earnings per share range of $12.30 to $13.30 reflects market performance through last Friday, our current view of fourth quarter performance fees [indiscernible] and a weighted average share count of approximately $55 million for 2016. 
Our 2017 economic earnings per share range of $14 to $16 assumes the full year impact of Capula and Winton as well as the equity issuance under the Ford, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and each quarter thereafter and includes our normal model convention for share repurchases in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017.
The lower end of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution for performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flow. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earning. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations. 
Now we will be happy to answer any questions."

And so focusing on the institutional channel, the ones I'd call out is sort of the levels of RFP activity and then certainly levels of finals activity, which were really strong and actually up again this quarter. So good balanced activity in the third quarter. I think, as you say, it's hard to predict on sort of short-term, only 3 months, but I will say, looking to the fourth quarter, that's often kind of a seasonally weak quarter for us, and I think a couple of the reasons for that are we've got kind of the year-end redemptions from both quarterly and annual lock vehicles, and we've obviously got the distribution of performance fees that are earned during the year. So those put a little bit of a headwind in. And then in retail you'll often see people sort of reticent to buy ahead of kind of tax distributions and stuff. 
And then as I said in the prepared remarks, this year there's actually more volatility in flows than normal. I think that's due to the macro environment. So wouldn't be surprised if you also saw some retail slowdowns due to just macro stuff like the election. 
But that said, underlying and fundamentally, both with respect to the quarter and then sort of looking at that longer-term trend, as I said in the prepared remarks, institutional pipelines were really strong, and RFP activity is good. Finals activity continues to tick up. And then, if you look at the medium term, obviously we still think the trends -- there are some headwinds, obviously, but the trends we're benefiting from remain intact. So investors have to get returns into their portfolios. We do think people will continue to barbell between sort of passive on the one side and then return oriented on the other. And our Affiliates are really well positioned to compete for and win those mandates and take share."

And they get, especially in these far-flung markets, the benefit of in-market client service and a single point of access to this very broad array of many of the industry's best boutique firms. 
And if you want any demonstration of or validation of the effectiveness of this strategy, you have only to look at the success that we've had over the past 7 years. As you know, 24 out of the past 26 quarters strong, positive flows in our active equity and alternative product set. It's a record that we'd compare to any in the industry. 
Sorry, the one other question that you asked is when you'll get an announcement, and I think in my prepared remarks I said early 2017. And I think I'm going to stick with that. Thanks, Craig."

But then the thing that's also different is we've begun to build in more consistent over the last couple quarters positive net flow contribution from our wealth partners Affiliates. And we continue to develop good traction there. And as you heard, we're continuing to grow out that platform. So I think that's also building some nice stability and diversity into that channel."

And as you've said, we did leave guidance unchanged, primarily because the impact from market beta was only modest. It will only have a modest impact on the fourth quarter, as you would expect, given that we're 3/4 of the way through the year. 
But just on the components, when we last gave guidance, which was August 1st, our market blend at that time was 2% up from the prior transcript. As you can see from our AUM tables, we experienced approximately 3.1% in market changes, which included FX. I put those 2 numbers together for the entire quarter. So 3.1% versus the 2% that we knew about. It had a positive impact of 1.1% relative to the last time we gave guidance going through the end of the quarter. So that was through the end of the third quarter. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, though, we have seen markets, including FX, off about 1.5%. So it took that positive 1% down to a negative 0.5%. 
I think the other thing that you're probably aware of is that when we remove our 2% market growth assumption for the fourth quarter, relative to our model that has a negative impact. So really down 2.5% from the model. 
All that being said, though, given it's the fourth quarter, it will only have a small impact on '16. So we left guidance unchanged because, setting markets aside, our 2016 range is primarily a judgment on performance fees, as you had mentioned. And when we look at various performance fee scenarios for the remainder of the year, both up and down scenarios, we have considered a few lumpy performance fees as well as the timing between 2016 and 2017 realizations in certain products. So considering all of that, that's why we left the range unchanged. 
Just to remind you of a couple of other items for 2016, there is a quarter lag in the financial reporting for capital in Winton, so we saw no impact of capital in this quarter other than the funding of Capula. We will see an impact in the fourth quarter with Capula being included, but we will not see Winton till next year. 
Second, we will assume no more -- for model purposes, no more share repurchases for 2016. None of these items will affect '17. So we'll have the full effect of Winton and Capula and we'll return to our normal model guidance. 
And then lastly, just to touch on 2017, even though we removed the 2% market and we were down a little bit quarter-to-date, we feel comfortable that our 2017 guidance range still captures our forward opportunity set, especially since we have a full year of both Capula and Winton in the numbers for next year. We also have included the full year effect of the $400 million of equity. $150 million has already been issued, $250 million in the fourth quarter. And reminding you of our model convention again, all of these numbers are included in our 56 million share count, average weighted share count for 2017. 
And then finally, just on performance fee expectations for next year, with the addition of Winton and Capula as well as just the broad diversity within our performance fee opportunity, we see kind of mid-teens at the midpoint of the guidance range for next year in terms of performance fee contribution."

I would say the theme is to sort of think about on the institutional flow side for the quarter, and then maybe I'll talk a little bit going -- looking forward. As we touched on in our prepared remarks, there were significantly higher gross sales in alternatives. AQR is a contributor there, but it was AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon. It was a number of firms that contributed significantly there. Also, we had relatively lower redemption rates in alternatives. So that was sort of -- the alternatives category did quite well. We also saw an uptick in gross sales in U.S. equities, and sort of same thing, sort of a moderating alpha in U.S. equities. So I think it was a couple things there. 
I've talked already about sort of fourth quarter and some of the seasonality there, but I think, again, the main thing to focus on is, as you look forward in the institution channel, is the trends that we think we've been benefiting from, put the headwinds aside for a second, those remain intact. And it's how do people get returns into portfolios, it's how do people continue to barbell passive and active and how well-positioned we are to compete for those active allocations, right? 
We have a large number of very good performing product in high demand areas, global and emerging markets and alternatives, as we've talked about. And then we've got, as Sean mentioned, we've got this unique sort of go-to-market distribution strategy, combining the Affiliates-focused teams at their level with the endless scope and scale of a large institution with significant sort of expertise by geography or by channel to bring to bear for the Affiliates as they want it.

So I'll try to address some, and then Nate, I'll ask you to fill in. 
The distribute -- the contribution to our flows from ""AMG distribution"" varies quarter-to-quarter, and we don't track it in a direct way because a lot of the influence is going to be in indirect ways. So I would say over time it is, in aggregate over the past 6, 7 years, about $50 billion in incremental contribution at least. And in any given period it's been half, sometimes more than half. And sometimes, of course, given the dynamics of a particular quarter, it's a less significant contribution. 
So I think the trend lines remain very much consistent and intact. As you heard Nate describe, we feel very good about our forward opportunity, especially, I mean ultimately, fundamentally driven by the quality and performance of our Affiliates. But their distribution and our distribution, alongside theirs, is absolutely contributing to our continued organic growth. 
Looking ahead, as I said, we see no change. There will be, of course, inevitable evolution, adaptation, growth in our distribution capabilities and strategy, but no fundamental change to the vision or strategy. We're looking for a -- and I'm very confident we'll find a very high quality, experienced, driven, motivated person who is a cultural fit with our team and of course with our Affiliates and our overall corporate philosophy.

So first, I think as we've said before, we don't believe that the DoL fiduciary rules will have a significant direct impact on our business. And all of our Affiliates that are interactive with retirement investors are already fiduciaries. And frankly, and this is -- goes beyond the direct use, frankly, the retirement area is actually one, on our U.S. side, is a part of our business that is relatively modest and is actually an area, as we sort of look out over the medium to long term, an area we should be able to really grow. 
I do think -- look, the other thing I think we've also said before is, we're probably doing much the same thing as many other people similarly situated, which is we're trying to help our distribution partner as the people that we work through and we're trying to figure out how we can best partner with them as they evolve the way they bring their offering to market. 
I do think there's some other things I'd add, which is, I think we're -- while we have a small share, we're relatively well positioned as you look at how those partners may be evolving their businesses. So we don't really have brokerage. We're almost all in the advisory side. We have by and large the right kinds of share classes to -- that will be attractive. 
And then importantly, and this picks up on a point Sean made earlier, we have -- this is a place where we can be enormously useful to our Affiliates, because having the scope and scale and breadth to be a good partner, to [indiscernible] as they go through their product rationalization may be very, very important. So again, it's not a direct impact, and the retirement piece is a small, relatively small part of our business today. And while there will be a bunch of sort of noise and work as we go through this, I do think there are opportunities on the kind of medium to long term for us to partner well with our channel partners."

I think the point I'd make, and this is consistent with the point Sean was just making, which is, look, the pressure is coming when you have poor returns in a space that's relatively crowded, even if people want that space. And so those are the places where you're seeing the pressure. But even in those areas, the strongest managers are both continuing to do well and continue to attract assets and then also will ultimately benefit from that evolution or shake-out or what have you.
