Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call as an independent public company. This is certainly an exciting time for Fortive. We're pleased with our results as we delivered outstanding free cash flow performance and margin expansion, despite core revenues being down slightly reflecting challenging economic conditions. 
On July 2, we successfully completed our separation from Danaher well ahead of schedule and with remarkable efficiency. We were able to achieve this outcome by leveraging the Fortive Business System tools and our deeply rooted institutional knowledge and results orientation. Given our decentralized operating model, the separation didn't change the day to day for the majority of our employees. What is clearly evident, however, is a reinvigoration of our culture ethos across the organization. The separation provides Fortive with the capacity for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market-leading positions. The Fortive Business System will continue to be the cornerstone of our competitive advantage by providing a playbook for accelerated innovation and superior customer satisfaction that will, in turn, drive improved core sales growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversion.  We are committed to embracing our strong culture of continuous improvement and driving shareholder value for the long term. 
And now, turning in the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results.  Please note that the following results are presented in a stand-alone basis from Danaher's historical results. 
Adjusted net earnings of $219.8 million were up 40 basis points over the prior year. Both reported and core revenue declined 50 basis points. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up low single digits and developed markets were down low single digits. High-growth market results were driven by high single-digit growth in China and strong double-digit growth in India, offset by continued weakness in Latin America. In developed markets, we continue to see soft industrial activity and weak distributor demand in our North American Professional Instrumentation businesses. 
While we continue to execute well, the economic environment remains challenging in some markets and geographies. We are encouraged as we enter the second half of the year with EMV starting to ramp up, key innovations launching across the portfolio and continued strength in high-growth markets. We also have a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System is demonstrated by adjusted gross margin expansion of 53 basis points to 49.6%. The improvement was driven by pricing, procurement savings and successful Lean initiatives across the portfolio that more than offset volume headwinds. 
Adjusted operating margins of 20.8% were essentially flat to the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 9 basis points as gross margin improvement was mostly offset by onetime G&A costs. We were very pleased that despite core revenue being slightly down, 4 of our 6 platforms had core operating margin expansion in the quarter.
We generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow, up 6%, and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 116%. Free cash flow is one of the most important measures at Fortive as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. As we have indicated, our capital allocation bias is to deploy our strong free cash flow towards acquisitions. Our M&A funnel has expanded nicely, in part due to the separation and the general choppiness in the markets over the first half of the year. Our experienced deal team is focused on the execution of our M&A strategy, and we are confident in the strength and diversity of our M&A funnel.
Turning to our segments. Reported and core Professional Instrumentation revenue was down 5% relative to prior year. Acquisitions contributed 50 basis points of growth, which was completely offset by unfavorable currency. Core adjusted operating margins were down 177 basis points for the quarter, reflecting reduced end market demand, technology growth investments and the timing of high contribution margin projects in our Pacific scientific EMC business.  
Advanced instrumentation and solutions core revenue declined mid-single digits, primarily reflecting reduced demand in semiconductor, consumer electronics and some industrial end markets. Field Solutions revenue declined a low single digits, reflecting a mid-single digit decline in Fluke, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in Qualitrol.  
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digit up in Western Europe primarily due to double-digit biomedical and network sales growth, but offset by high single digits declines in the U.S. reflecting weaker distributor demand.  Our continued investment in customer-led innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated products, including our recently launched Fluke Connect condition monitoring offering. This is the industry's first system of portable sensors and network gateway and software that customers can access anywhere anytime and use advanced analytics to make preventive maintenance decisions. We are very excited about this unique product offering in an important step forward with our connected devices strategy.  As a result of our innovation, growth and productivity initiatives at Fluke, year-on-year operating margins were up 50 basis points. 
Qualitrol's mid-single digit growth was driven by strong OEM sales outside the U.S. with end customer demand based primarily in the Middle East. We continue to see meaningful wins at Qualitrol and believe this business will continue to be a key growth contributor for Field Solutions. 
In Product Realization, a mid-single digit core revenue decline, primarily reflecting reduced demand for Tektronix product, was partially offset by core revenue growth in [indiscernible]. Despite double-digit growth in China and share gains from our optical solutions, Tektronix saw high single-digit core decline, broadly reflecting weak semiconductor and consumer electronics activity outside of China. 
One final note on Tektronix, we were selected by NBC as the audio and video tech equipment provider for its production of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio starting this Friday.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw high single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter as continued industrial softness was partially offset by a growth in the medical food and beverage and aerospace and defense markets. The teams proactively managed cost to maintain core operating margins despite the volume shortfall. 
to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized both reported and core revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Core adjusted operating margins improved 166 basis points, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and increased volume. 
Our transportation and technologies platforms saw high single-digit growth in the quarter. Gilbarco Veeder-Root deliver the fourth consecutive quarter with high single-digit core revenue growth. EMV-related demand in the U.S. spurted double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. Many customers are still in the process of upgrading payment systems from last October's liability shift, and we are well positioned to benefit from the outdoor liability shift slated for October of 2017.
In May, Gilbarco launched FlexPay 4 as next generation industry-leading line of EMV-certified dispensers, reflecting continued innovation as our first major hardware product launch stemming from our partnership with Verifone. Also in May, Gilbarco Veeder-Root released the industry's first multinetwork credit and debit EMV-certified petroleum retail point-of-sale solution. 
Support of multiple common payment types reduces consumer confusion around inserting versus wiping their card at the payment terminal. Multi-EMV cards format support ensures that all EMV-capable cards are processed as a chip payment, reducing consumer ambiguity and increasing consumer satisfaction while maximizing the retailers' protection against fraud and liability. 
Telematics had a strong quarter with high single-digit growth, led by strong double-digit core revenue gains in high-growth markets. As you may recall, we integrated Navman and Teletrac last year, bringing these 2 companies together to create one strong business for us from both a global market and technology perspective.  This quarter, we drove solid install base growth in our largest SaaS business in Fortive. We believe we are well positioned to increase revenue into our subscription base and create stickiness, given our offerings to help customers with safety and compliance.
Automation & Specialty components posted low single-digit core growth decline for the quarter as growth in Kollmorgen was more than offset by declines in the rest of the businesses. Jacobs Vehicle Systems continue to be impacted by the weakness in the North American truck market, partially offset by strong double-digit growth in Europe. 
Our Franchise Distribution platform posted low single-digit growth. Matco, we grow revenue at mid-single digits as we continue to gain share [indiscernible] increased same-store sales and franchisee adds. Using FPS tools like funnel management and digital marketing, Matco posted mid-single digit growth or better for 24 of the last 26 quarters. 
To sum up, we are encouraged by continued strength in our Industrial Technologies segment and stabilization in our Professional Instrumentation segment. Through the successful deployment of FBS, we are able to launch new products, take market share and realize operating efficiencies across a number of businesses. Focused execution combined with the strength and diversity of our portfolio allowed us to deliver margin expansion and generate outstanding free cash flow despite challenging macro conditions. 
We are initiating adjusted and diluted net EPS guidance for the third quarter of $0.56 to $0.60. For the second half of 2016, we are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.21 to $1.29 and continuing to assume low single-digit core revenue growth.
In closing, our value-creation strategy is focused on core revenue growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow deployment biased towards acquisitions. We will follow a strategic and financially disciplined approach to M&A with the goal of building market leadership positions and increasing returns on capital. We are committed to the principles of the Fortive Business System to deliver customer-driven innovation and shareholder value over the long term. We are very excited about the future in establishing our own independent record of strong performance for many years and decades to come."

As I said, we don't have a lot of oil and gas exposure in the portfolio. Fluke North America might be a little bit, but most of it's really more second derivative as I mentioned, a little bit in the sensors process. But we don't think where oil is today means any precipitous drop, even where we are at right now is much more of an impact at this point."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call as an independent public company. 
This is certainly an exciting time for Fortive. We're pleased with our results as we delivered outstanding free cash flow performance and margin expansion despite core revenues being down slightly reflecting challenging economic conditions. 
On July 2, we successfully completed our separation from Danaher well ahead of schedule and with remarkable efficiency. We were able to achieve this outcome by leveraging the Fortive Business System tools and our deeply-rooted institutional knowledge and results orientation. Given our decentralized operating model, the separation didn't change the day to day for the majority of our employees. What is clearly evident, however, is that a reinvigoration of our culture is installed across the organization. The separation provides Fortive with the capacity for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market-leading positions. The Fortive Business System will continue to be the cornerstone of our competitive advantage by providing a playbook for accelerated innovation and superior customer satisfaction that will, in turn, drive improved core sales growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversions.  We are committed to embracing our strong culture of continuous improvement and driving shareholder value for the long term. 
And now, turning to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results.  Please note that the following results are presented on a stand-alone basis from Danaher's historical results. 
Adjusted net earnings of $219.8 million were up 40 basis points over the prior year. Both reported and core revenue declined 50 basis points. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up low single digits and developed markets were down low single digits. High-growth market results were driven by high single-digit growth in China and strong double-digit growth in India, offset by continued weakness in Latin America. In developed markets, we continue to see soft industrial activity and weak distributor demand in our North American Professional Instrumentation businesses. 
While we continue to execute well, the economic environment remains challenging in some markets and geographies. We are encouraged as we enter the second half of the year with EMV starting to ramp up, key innovations launching across the portfolio and continued strength in high-growth markets. We also have a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was demonstrated by adjusted gross margin expansion of 53 basis points to 49.6%. The improvement was driven by pricing, procurement savings and successful Lean initiatives across the portfolio that more than offset volume headwinds. 
Adjusted operating margins of 20.8% were essentially flat to the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 9 basis points as gross margin improvement was mostly offset by onetime G&A costs. We were very pleased that despite core revenue being slightly down, 4 out of our 6 platforms had core operating margin expansion in the quarter.
We generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow, up 6%, and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 116%. Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Fortive as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. 
As we have indicated, our capital allocation bias is to deploy our strong free cash flow towards acquisitions. Our M&A funnel has expanded nicely, in part, due to the separation and the general choppiness of the markets over the first half of the year. Our experienced deal team is focused on the execution of our M&A strategy, and we are confident in the strength and diversity of our M&A funnel.
Turning to our segments. Reported and core Professional Instrumentation revenue was down 5% relative to prior year. Acquisitions contributed 50 basis points of growth, which was completely offset by unfavorable currency. Core adjusted operating margins were down 177 basis points for the quarter, reflecting reduced end market demand, technology growth investments and the timing of high contribution margin projects in our Pacific Scientific EMC business.  
Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue declined mid-single digits, primarily reflecting reduced demand in semiconductor, consumer electronic and some industrial end markets. Field Solutions revenue declined to low single digits, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in Fluke, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in Qualitrol.  
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits in Western Europe, primarily due to double-digit biomedical and network sales growth, but offset by high single-digit declines in the U.S. reflecting weaker distributor demand.  
Our continued investments in customer-led innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated products, including our recently launched Fluke Connect condition monitoring offering. This is the industry's first system of portable sensors and network gateway and software that customers can access anywhere, anytime and use advanced analytics to make preventive maintenance decisions. We are very excited about this unique product offering in an important step forward with our connected devices strategy.  As a result of our innovation, growth and productivity initiatives at Fluke, year-on-year operating margins were up 50 basis points. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was driven by strong OEM sales outside of the U.S., with end customer demand based primarily in the Middle East. We continue to see meaningful wins at Qualitrol, and believe this business will continue to be a key growth contributor for Field Solutions. 
In Product Realization, a mid-single-digit core revenue decline, primarily reflecting reduced demand for Tektronix products, was partially offset by core revenue growth in Invetech. Despite double-digit growth in China and share gains from our optical solutions, Tektronix saw high single-digit core decline broadly reflecting weak semiconductor and consumer electronics activity outside of China. 
One final timely note on Tektronix, we were selected by NBC as the audio and video test equipment provider for its production of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio starting this Friday.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw high single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter as continued industrial softness was partially offset via growth in the medical food and beverage and aerospace and defense markets. The teams proactively managed cost to maintain core operating margins despite the volume shortfall. 
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized both reported and core revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Core adjusted operating margins improved 166 basis points, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and increased volume. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered the fourth consecutive quarter with high single-digit core revenue growth. EMV-related demand in the U.S. spurred double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. Many customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems from last October's liability shift, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the outdoor liability shift slated for October of 2017.
In May, Gilbarco launched FlexPay IV as the next generation industry-leading line of EMV-certified dispensers, reflecting continued innovation as our first major hardware product launch stemming from our partnership with Verifone. Also in May, Gilbarco released the industry's first multi-network credit and debit, EMV-certified petroleum retail point-of-sale solution.  
Support of multiple common payment types reduces consumer confusion around inserting versus swiping their card at the payment terminal. Multi-EMV cards format support ensures that all EMV-capable cards are processed as a chip payment, reducing consumer ambiguity and increasing consumer satisfaction while maximizing the retailers' protection against fraud and liability. 
Telematics had a strong quarter with high single-digit growth led by strong double-digit core revenue gains in high-growth markets. As you may recall, we integrated Navman and Teletrac last year, bringing these 2 companies together to create one strong business for us from both a global market and technology perspective.  This quarter, we drove solid installed base growth in our largest SaaS business in Fortive. We believe we are well-positioned to increase revenue into our subscription base and create stickiness given our offerings to help customers with safety and compliance.
Automation & Specialty components posted low single-digit core growth decline for the quarter as growth in Kollmorgen was more than offset by declines in the rest of the businesses. Jacobs Vehicle Systems continue to be impacted by the weakness in the North American truck market, partially offset by strong double-digit growth in Europe. 
Our Franchise Distribution platform posted low single-digit growth. At Matco, we grew revenue at mid-single digits as we continue to gain via both increased same-store sales and franchisee adds. Using FBS tools such as funnel management and digital marketing, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 24 of the last 26 quarters. 
To summarize, we are encouraged by continued strength in our Industrial Technologies segment and stabilization in our Professional Instrumentation segment. Through the successful deployment of FBS, we were able to launch new products, take market share and realize operating efficiencies across a number of businesses. Focused execution, combined with the strength and diversity of our portfolio, allowed us to deliver margin expansion and generate outstanding free cash flow despite challenging macro conditions. 
We are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance for the third quarter of $0.56 to $0.60. For the second half of 2016, we are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.21 to $1.29 and continuing to assume low single-digit core revenue growth.
In closing, our value-creation strategy is focused on core revenue growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow deployment biased towards acquisitions. We will follow a strategic and financially disciplined approach to M&A with the goal of building market leadership positions and increasing returns on capital. We are committed to the principles of the Fortive Business System to deliver customer-driven innovation and shareholder value over the long term. We are very excited about the future in establishing our own independent record of strong performance for many years and decades to come."

Certainly, Transportation Technologies continues to be in a strong position. We've seen some good improvement in Qualitrol, Matco, as we described in the prepared remarks. And then Kollmorgen having growth in the second quarter, I think, is a nice place to be. So I think on balance, that's what gives us confidence in the guide here to be low single-digit growth in the second half.

And we see that geographically in the U.S. where we're growing pretty well with distributor sales out on the coast, but in the middle of the U.S., we're slightly slower. So that'll continue for a little bit. We were happy with a high-growth market growth there, particularly in India and China. So I think -- and also, continuing to get margin expansion in the second quarter despite the decline of Fluke, I think, really means we're continuing to get good price, it really shows the strength of the business. With the Fluke Connect condition monitoring launch and a number of other innovations in the second half, I think we'll start to see some acceleration. Beyond the comps in the fourth quarter, we'll start to see some acceleration as we get into 2017."

So little bit tougher comp there. But we think we can continue to sustain what we've got with a good, active funnel and a number of things that we've got going. The FlexPay launch that we talked about in the prepared remarks is just a good example of bringing more innovation in helping us take share in the market. Relative to our assumptions, we don't think we'll ever get to 100% penetration in 2 to 3 years, so we sort of assume that kind of an 80% penetration might be achievable in the next 3 to 4 years. But to be honest with you, when you look at the outdoor penetration  we just started, we revise those models every month based on what we've seen both in terms of actual sales and orders, but also on what we're hearing from customers. And I think those models will really get more refined as we turn the table on '16 and into '17 as we see a more active customer base. And so while we could make some predictions around what that looks like, I think we're really -- were probably 5 to 6 months away from really knowing what that might look like to hard code that into whether that's 2 or 3 years or 3 to 4 years at this point."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call as an independent public company. 
This is certainly an exciting time for Fortive. We're pleased with our results as we delivered outstanding free cash flow performance and margin expansion despite core revenues being down slightly reflecting challenging economic conditions. 
On July 2, we successfully completed our separation from Danaher well ahead of schedule and with remarkable efficiency. We were able to achieve this outcome by leveraging the Fortive Business System tools and our deeply-rooted institutional knowledge and results orientation. Given our decentralized operating model, the separation didn't change the day to day for the majority of our employees. What is clearly evident, however, is that a reinvigoration of our culture is installed across the organization. The separation provides Fortive with the capacity for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market-leading positions. The Fortive Business System will continue to be the cornerstone of our competitive advantage by providing a playbook for accelerated innovation and superior customer satisfaction that will, in turn, drive improved core sales growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversions.  We are committed to embracing our strong culture of continuous improvement and driving shareholder value for the long term. 
And now, turning to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results.  Please note that the following results are presented on a stand-alone basis from Danaher's historical results. 
Adjusted net earnings of $219.8 million were up 40 basis points over the prior year. Both reported and core revenue declined 50 basis points. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up low single digits and developed markets were down low single digits. High-growth market results were driven by high single-digit growth in China and strong double-digit growth in India, offset by continued weakness in Latin America. In developed markets, we continue to see soft industrial activity and weak distributor demand in our North American Professional Instrumentation businesses. 
While we continue to execute well, the economic environment remains challenging in some markets and geographies. We are encouraged as we enter the second half of the year with EMV starting to ramp up, key innovations launching across the portfolio and continued strength in high-growth markets. We also have a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was demonstrated by adjusted gross margin expansion of 53 basis points to 49.6%. The improvement was driven by pricing, procurement savings and successful Lean initiatives across the portfolio that more than offset volume headwinds. 
Adjusted operating margins of 20.8% were essentially flat to the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 9 basis points as gross margin improvement was mostly offset by onetime G&A costs. We were very pleased that despite core revenue being slightly down, 4 out of our 6 platforms had core operating margin expansion in the quarter.
We generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow, up 6%, and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 116%. Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Fortive as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. 
As we have indicated, our capital allocation bias is to deploy our strong free cash flow towards acquisitions. Our M&A funnel has expanded nicely, in part, due to the separation and the general choppiness of the markets over the first half of the year. Our experienced deal team is focused on the execution of our M&A strategy, and we are confident in the strength and diversity of our M&A funnel.
Turning to our segments. Reported and core Professional Instrumentation revenue was down 5% relative to prior year. Acquisitions contributed 50 basis points of growth, which was completely offset by unfavorable currency. Core adjusted operating margins were down 177 basis points for the quarter, reflecting reduced end market demand, technology growth investments and the timing of high contribution margin projects in our Pacific Scientific EMC business.  
Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue declined mid-single digits, primarily reflecting reduced demand in semiconductor, consumer electronic and some industrial end markets. Field Solutions revenue declined to low single digits, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in Fluke, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in Qualitrol.  
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits in Western Europe, primarily due to double-digit biomedical and network sales growth, but offset by high single-digit declines in the U.S. reflecting weaker distributor demand.  
Our continued investments in customer-led innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated products, including our recently launched Fluke Connect condition monitoring offering. This is the industry's first system of portable sensors and network gateway and software that customers can access anywhere, anytime and use advanced analytics to make preventive maintenance decisions. We are very excited about this unique product offering in an important step forward with our connected devices strategy.  As a result of our innovation, growth and productivity initiatives at Fluke, year-on-year operating margins were up 50 basis points. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was driven by strong OEM sales outside of the U.S., with end customer demand based primarily in the Middle East. We continue to see meaningful wins at Qualitrol, and believe this business will continue to be a key growth contributor for Field Solutions. 
In Product Realization, a mid-single-digit core revenue decline, primarily reflecting reduced demand for Tektronix products, was partially offset by core revenue growth in Invetech. Despite double-digit growth in China and share gains from our optical solutions, Tektronix saw high single-digit core decline broadly reflecting weak semiconductor and consumer electronics activity outside of China. 
One final timely note on Tektronix, we were selected by NBC as the audio and video test equipment provider for its production of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio starting this Friday.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw high single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter as continued industrial softness was partially offset via growth in the medical food and beverage and aerospace and defense markets. The teams proactively managed cost to maintain core operating margins despite the volume shortfall. 
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized both reported and core revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Core adjusted operating margins improved 166 basis points, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and increased volume. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered the fourth consecutive quarter with high single-digit core revenue growth. EMV-related demand in the U.S. spurred double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. Many customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems from last October's liability shift, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the outdoor liability shift slated for October of 2017.
In May, Gilbarco launched FlexPay IV as the next generation industry-leading line of EMV-certified dispensers, reflecting continued innovation as our first major hardware product launch stemming from our partnership with Verifone. Also in May, Gilbarco released the industry's first multi-network credit and debit, EMV-certified petroleum retail point-of-sale solution.  
Support of multiple common payment types reduces consumer confusion around inserting versus swiping their card at the payment terminal. Multi-EMV cards format support ensures that all EMV-capable cards are processed as a chip payment, reducing consumer ambiguity and increasing consumer satisfaction while maximizing the retailers' protection against fraud and liability. 
Telematics had a strong quarter with high single-digit growth led by strong double-digit core revenue gains in high-growth markets. As you may recall, we integrated Navman and Teletrac last year, bringing these 2 companies together to create one strong business for us from both a global market and technology perspective.  This quarter, we drove solid installed base growth in our largest SaaS business in Fortive. We believe we are well-positioned to increase revenue into our subscription base and create stickiness given our offerings to help customers with safety and compliance.
Automation & Specialty components posted low single-digit core growth decline for the quarter as growth in Kollmorgen was more than offset by declines in the rest of the businesses. Jacobs Vehicle Systems continue to be impacted by the weakness in the North American truck market, partially offset by strong double-digit growth in Europe. 
Our Franchise Distribution platform posted low single-digit growth. At Matco, we grew revenue at mid-single digits as we continue to gain share via both increased same-store sales and franchisee adds. Using FBS tools such as funnel management and digital marketing, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 24 of the last 26 quarters. 
To summarize, we are encouraged by continued strength in our Industrial Technologies segment and stabilization in our Professional Instrumentation segment. Through the successful deployment of FBS, we were able to launch new products, take market share and realize operating efficiencies across a number of businesses. Focused execution, combined with the strength and diversity of our portfolio, allowed us to deliver margin expansion and generate outstanding free cash flow despite challenging macro conditions. 
We are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance for the third quarter of $0.56 to $0.60. For the second half of 2016, we are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.21 to $1.29 and continuing to assume low single-digit core revenue growth.
In closing, our value-creation strategy is focused on core revenue growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow deployment biased towards acquisitions. We will follow a strategic and financially disciplined approach to M&A with the goal of building market leadership positions and increasing returns on capital. We are committed to the principles of the Fortive Business System to deliver customer-driven innovation and shareholder value over the long term. We are very excited about the future in establishing our own independent record of strong performance for many years and decades to come."

Certainly, Transportation Technologies continues to be in a strong position. We've seen some good improvement in Qualitrol, Matco, as we described in the prepared remarks. And then Kollmorgen having growth in the second quarter, I think, is a nice place to be. So I think on balance, that's what gives us confidence in the guide here to be low single-digit growth in the second half.

On the outdoor side, we're very early stages. If I were to do a baseball analogy, I'd feel like we're in the first or second inning here. So not sure what that is on a percentage basis. We will see some acceleration though in the second half due to EMV, both on the indoor and a little bit on the outdoor side. So you'll see that. As we mentioned before, we still believe it's a $500 million incremental opportunity over the next several years. And we're still not calling the timeframe in that other than the next 2 to 3 years just given how early we are in the outdoor penetration cycle, Nigel."

Gilbarco's had some good additions in the China market as well. So a number -- we mentioned Kollmorgen as well doing well in China as well.

The FlexPay launch that we talked about in the prepared remarks is just a good example of bringing more innovation in helping us take share in the market. Relative to our assumptions, we don't think we'll ever get to 100% penetration in 2 to 3 years, so we sort of assume that kind of an 80% penetration might be achievable in the next 3 to 4 years. But to be honest with you, when you look at the outdoor penetration  we just started, we revise those models every month based on what we've seen both in terms of actual sales and orders, but also on what we're hearing from customers. And I think those models will really get more refined as we turn the table on '16 and into '17 as we see a more active customer base.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call as an independent public company. 
This is certainly an exciting time for Fortive. We're pleased with our results as we delivered outstanding free cash flow performance and margin expansion despite core revenues being down slightly reflecting challenging economic conditions. 
On July 2, we successfully completed our separation from Danaher well ahead of schedule and with remarkable efficiency. We were able to achieve this outcome by leveraging the Fortive Business System tools and our deeply-rooted institutional knowledge and results orientation. Given our decentralized operating model, the separation didn't change the day to day for the majority of our employees. What is clearly evident, however, is that a reinvigoration of our culture is installed across the organization. The separation provides Fortive with the capacity for disciplined acquisitions and growth investments to strengthen our businesses and market-leading positions. The Fortive Business System will continue to be the cornerstone of our competitive advantage by providing a playbook for accelerated innovation and superior customer satisfaction that will, in turn, drive improved core sales growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversions.  We are committed to embracing our strong culture of continuous improvement and driving shareholder value for the long term. 
And now, turning to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results.  Please note that the following results are presented on a stand-alone basis from Danaher's historical results. 
Adjusted net earnings of $219.8 million were up 40 basis points over the prior year. Both reported and core revenue declined 50 basis points. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up low single digits and developed markets were down low single digits. High-growth market results were driven by high single-digit growth in China and strong double-digit growth in India, offset by continued weakness in Latin America. In developed markets, we continue to see soft industrial activity and weak distributor demand in our North American Professional Instrumentation businesses. 
While we continue to execute well, the economic environment remains challenging in some markets and geographies. We are encouraged as we enter the second half of the year with EMV starting to ramp up, key innovations launching across the portfolio and continued strength in high-growth markets. We also have a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was demonstrated by adjusted gross margin expansion of 53 basis points to 49.6%. The improvement was driven by pricing, procurement savings and successful Lean initiatives across the portfolio that more than offset volume headwinds. 
Adjusted operating margins of 20.8% were essentially flat to the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 9 basis points as gross margin improvement was mostly offset by onetime G&A costs. We were very pleased that despite core revenue being slightly down, 4 out of our 6 platforms had core operating margin expansion in the quarter.
We generated approximately $278 million of free cash flow, up 6%, and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 116%. Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Fortive as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. 
As we have indicated, our capital allocation bias is to deploy our strong free cash flow towards acquisitions. Our M&A funnel has expanded nicely, in part, due to the separation and the general choppiness of the markets over the first half of the year. Our experienced deal team is focused on the execution of our M&A strategy, and we are confident in the strength and diversity of our M&A funnel.
Turning to our segments. Reported and core Professional Instrumentation revenue was down 5% relative to prior year. Acquisitions contributed 50 basis points of growth, which was completely offset by unfavorable currency. Core adjusted operating margins were down 177 basis points for the quarter, reflecting reduced end market demand, technology growth investments and the timing of high contribution margin projects in our Pacific Scientific EMC business.  
Advanced Instrumentation & Solutions core revenue declined mid-single digits, primarily reflecting reduced demand in semiconductor, consumer electronic and some industrial end markets. Field Solutions revenue declined to low single digits, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in Fluke, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in Qualitrol.  
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits in Western Europe, primarily due to double-digit biomedical and network sales growth, but offset by high single-digit declines in the U.S. reflecting weaker distributor demand.  
Our continued investments in customer-led innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated products, including our recently launched Fluke Connect condition monitoring offering. This is the industry's first system of portable sensors and network gateway and software that customers can access anywhere, anytime and use advanced analytics to make preventive maintenance decisions. We are very excited about this unique product offering in an important step forward with our connected devices strategy.  As a result of our innovation, growth and productivity initiatives at Fluke, year-on-year operating margins were up 50 basis points. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was driven by strong OEM sales outside of the U.S., with end customer demand based primarily in the Middle East. We continue to see meaningful wins at Qualitrol, and believe this business will continue to be a key growth contributor for Field Solutions. 
In Product Realization, a mid-single-digit core revenue decline, primarily reflecting reduced demand for Tektronix products, was partially offset by core revenue growth in Invetech. Despite double-digit growth in China and share gains from our optical solutions, Tektronix saw high single-digit core decline broadly reflecting weak semiconductor and consumer electronics activity outside of China. 
One final timely note on Tektronix, we were selected by NBC as the audio and video test equipment provider for its production of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio starting this Friday.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw high single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter as continued industrial softness was partially offset via growth in the medical food and beverage and aerospace and defense markets. The teams proactively managed cost to maintain core operating margins despite the volume shortfall. 
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized both reported and core revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Core adjusted operating margins improved 166 basis points, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and increased volume. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered the fourth consecutive quarter with high single-digit core revenue growth. EMV-related demand in the U.S. spurred double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. Many customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems from last October's liability shift, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the outdoor liability shift slated for October of 2017.
In May, Gilbarco launched FlexPay IV as the next generation industry-leading line of EMV-certified dispensers, reflecting continued innovation as our first major hardware product launch stemming from our partnership with Verifone. Also in May, Gilbarco released the industry's first multi-network credit and debit, EMV-certified petroleum retail point-of-sale solution.  
Support of multiple common payment types reduces consumer confusion around inserting versus swiping their card at the payment terminal. Multi-EMV cards format support ensures that all EMV-capable cards are processed as a chip payment, reducing consumer ambiguity and increasing consumer satisfaction while maximizing the retailers' protection against fraud and liability. 
Telematics had a strong quarter with high single-digit growth led by strong double-digit core revenue gains in high-growth markets. As you may recall, we integrated Navman and Teletrac last year, bringing these 2 companies together to create one strong business for us from both a global market and technology perspective.  This quarter, we drove solid installed base growth in our largest SaaS business in Fortive. We believe we are well-positioned to increase revenue into our subscription base and create stickiness given our offerings to help customers with safety and compliance.
Automation & Specialty components posted low single-digit core growth decline for the quarter as growth in Kollmorgen was more than offset by declines in the rest of the businesses. Jacobs Vehicle Systems continue to be impacted by the weakness in the North American truck market, partially offset by strong double-digit growth in Europe. 
Our Franchise Distribution platform posted low single-digit growth. At Matco, we grew revenue at mid-single digits as we continue to gain share via both increased same-store sales and franchisee adds. Using FBS tools such as funnel management and digital marketing, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 24 of the last 26 quarters. 
To summarize, we are encouraged by continued strength in our Industrial Technologies segment and stabilization in our Professional Instrumentation segment. Through the successful deployment of FBS, we were able to launch new products, take market share and realize operating efficiencies across a number of businesses. Focused execution, combined with the strength and diversity of our portfolio, allowed us to deliver margin expansion and generate outstanding free cash flow despite challenging macro conditions. 
We are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance for the third quarter of $0.56 to $0.60. For the second half of 2016, we are initiating adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.21 to $1.29 and continuing to assume low single-digit core revenue growth.
In closing, our value-creation strategy is focused on core revenue growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow deployment biased towards acquisitions. We will follow a strategic and financially disciplined approach to M&A with the goal of building market leadership positions and increasing returns on capital. We are committed to the principles of the Fortive Business System to deliver customer-driven innovation and shareholder value over the long term. We are very excited about the future in establishing our own independent record of strong performance for many years and decades to come."

And then Kollmorgen having growth in the second quarter, I think, is a nice place to be. So I think on balance, that's what gives us confidence in the guide here to be low single-digit growth in the second half.

You saw that at -- you saw good improvement at Qualitrol. We had good improvement at sensors, where we offset their volume decline. We did have some challenges in Product Realization. As we mentioned, the volume decline in tech hurt as a little bit, and some high contribution margin opportunities at the Pacific Scientific EMC which moved out into the second half. So those, I think, on balance, when you look across the portfolio, the fact that 5 of our 6 platforms had gross margin flat to up, really speaks to the power of FBS. And I think that really speaks to what we'll do -- what we can do here. So while Professional Instrumentation was down a little bit, when you peak below the numbers, we had some good performance in several platforms."

Gilbarco's had some good additions in the China market as well. So a number -- we mentioned Kollmorgen as well doing well in China as well. So I think some of our businesses are off a lower base, and so the power of what they've done from an innovation perspective and from an FBS perspective is helping them.

So little bit tougher comp there. But we think we can continue to sustain what we've got with a good, active funnel and a number of things that we've got going. The FlexPay launch that we talked about in the prepared remarks is just a good example of bringing more innovation in helping us take share in the market. Relative to our assumptions, we don't think we'll ever get to 100% penetration in 2 to 3 years, so we sort of assume that kind of an 80% penetration might be achievable in the next 3 to 4 years. But to be honest with you, when you look at the outdoor penetration  we just started, we revise those models every month based on what we've seen both in terms of actual sales and orders, but also on what we're hearing from customers. And I think those models will really get more refined as we turn the table on '16 and into '17 as we see a more active customer base.

We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion, free cash flow well in excess of net income and earnings outperformance. The Fortive Business System is the driving force behind our performance and is the cornerstone of both Fortive's culture and operating model. 
We recently held the first-ever Fortive CEO kaizen focused on our key shareholder and customer-facing metrics of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Kaizen means continuous improvement and our kaizen events are one of the many ways we commit to this Fortive value as our way of life. What makes the CEO kaizen unique is that more than 50 of our top leaders across the company go shoulder to shoulder with our front-line operators this year at 4 selected sites to attack our highest priority initiatives. 
The CEO kaizen was an exciting milestone for me personally, and I'm energized by the breakthroughs and amazing results achieved during this event. With the launch of Fortive, we have a good opportunity to deepen our dedication to the Fortive Business System and show the power of 24,000 people devoted to our purpose of providing essential technology for the people who create, implement and accelerate progress.
With that, I would like to turn to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results. The following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the updated supplemental financial data that Lisa described at the top of the call. 
Adjusted net earnings of $233.1 million were up 22.2% over the prior year. Sales grew 2.8% to $1.6 billion, with core revenue increase of 2.7%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 60 basis points of growth over the prior year, which was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Geographically, solid performance in high-growth markets drove revenues up mid-single digits, and developed markets improved to low single-digit growth. The high-growth market results were primarily driven by India and double-digit growth in China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America where we realized a double-digit decline, given continued challenging market conditions. 
In developed markets, we saw low single-digit growth in North America, primarily driven by the strength of EMV-related demand for our Gilbarco offerings and strong growth at Matco and Qualitrol and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. We expect the Western Europe growth to moderate in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was clearly demonstrated with outstanding margin expansion. We were very pleased that 4 out of our 6 platforms had both growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 30 basis points to 49.3%. Operating margins of 20.6% were up 140 basis points versus the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 150 basis points. The strong margin expansion represents above-average incremental fallthrough of approximately 75%, reflecting favorable mix and sales growth weighted towards the end of the quarter.
During the third quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, up 50% over the prior year and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 134%. Cash generation was unusually strong this quarter in part due to the timing of interest and tax payments. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be above 100%. 
Our M&A funnel continues to expand, and I remain confident regarding the growth opportunities presented, given the size and diversity of our pipeline. During the quarter, we closed 2 important bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $200 million that accelerates several of our key strategic initiatives, which I will talk a little bit more about later. We expect to remain active on the deal front, with a continued disciplined focus on accelerating growth and returns to our M&A strategy. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter improved to 27.6% versus our previous outlook of 30%. We expect our adjusted rate going forward to be approximately 28%.
Turning to our segments. We were pleased to see improved performance in Professional Instrumentation, with revenue up slightly, reflecting 70 basis points of core growth, partially offset by 40 basis points of currency and 10 basis points from the impact of acquisitions in the separation. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 22.3%, and core operating margins were up 110 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting a favorable business mix to prior year as well as successful price and productivity initiatives. During the quarter, Professional Instrumentation realized approximately 40 basis points of favorable price.
Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single digits, led by demand for test applications and connected equipment monitoring solutions. In field solutions, core revenues were up low single digits, led by mid-single-digit growth at Qualitrol and low single-digit growth at Fluke, reflecting good demand for handheld industrial products as well as our thermography and network offerings. 
Fluke delivered mid-single-digit growth in both Western Europe and China. This strong growth was partially offset by continued weakness in certain North American end markets. Fluke continued to demonstrate the strength of innovation through numerous awards, including 2 Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine Product of the Year awards for Fluke Connected assets in the software maintenance management category and for Fluke TIX 560 [ph] in the cameras and imaging equipment category. 
During our last earnings call, I highlighted our Fluke Connect Condition Monitoring System as an example of customer-led innovation. I'm excited to report that the reception to this new product offering has been outstanding. This product is an important step in our connected device strategy, which was recently accelerated via the acquisition of eMaint Enterprises, a global leader in SaaS-based computer -- computerized maintenance management software. 
The combination of Fluke Connect toolbox with eMaint's SaaS offering will allow for increased asset uptime via the seamless integration of maintenance devices data and systems. Fluke and eMaint have joined forces to usher in a new era of connectivity and are set to deliver groundbreaking asset reliability platforms for multi-industrial customers around the world. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was primarily driven by the high-growth markets, where we saw solid asset protection growth and market share gains, driven by the refinement of our go-to-market strategy. This quarter marked Qualitrol's 10th consecutive quarter of positive core growth, and we're excited about our position in this important condition-based monitoring sector. 
In Product Realization, core revenues were slightly up, led by double-digit growth in our PacSci EMC business. The stronger-than-normal EMC growth reflected the timing of several projects that you will recall moved out of last quarter. Year-to-date, EMC delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth.
As expected, Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits and improved sequentially, reflecting sales improvements in nearly all regions and a return to positive growth in our high-growth markets. Tektronix is now our largest business in China, and it continued to outperform in the region by recognizing double-digit growth, given strong demand for our solutions geared for new way for technology in the semiconductor industry and data center applications. 
By leveraging our FBS growth and innovation tools, we've been able to upgrade our 70-gigahertz real-time oscilloscope with advanced software to target data centers where high-quality -- very high-quality signal measurements are critical to ensure data center uptime and performance.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw a low single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter, as declines in our control product lines were partially offset by solid growth in our sensing businesses, which was driven by exposure to the medical and food and beverage verticals. We were pleased to be awarded a multiyear contract with to supply electrical products to the U.S. Navy, with the potential to realize approximately $300 million -- $3 million in revenue over the next 12 months.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized reported growth of 5.1%, with core revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 90 basis points of growth over prior year, which was offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 21.4%, and core operating margins were up 230 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, productivity as well as material cost and supply chain improvements. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter, with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by our best-in-class retail fueling portfolio. At Gilbarco, we're starting to see a deceleration in EMV-related demand for indoor point-of-sale solutions as the liability transfer occurred in October 2015. However, demand associated with the pending outdoor liability shift in the U.S. has increased for both dispenser and EMV payment kits. 
While we are in the early innings, growth is weighted towards kits this quarter. On the innovation front, Gilbarco recently released contactless and 2D barcode scanner options on FlexPay IV, our market-leading EMV payment platform. 
We are winning not just in the U.S. but in other international markets as well. Our new PCI 4 [ph] payment platform continues to gain traction in the market since its launch in Q2, securing our market-leading position, which helped us to close a multimillion dollar 5-year contract with a leading major oil retailer in Italy.
Telematics realized core growth of low single digits in the quarter, reflecting strong international growth. The recent launch of our new SaaS platform called Director has been well received, and the installed base transition will take approximately 18 to 24 months to complete.
In keeping with our Transportation Technologies platform evolution from retail fueling to smart transportation, we closed the acquisition of Global Traffic Technologies or GTT and entered an attractive market adjacency with mid-single-digit or better growth characteristics. GTT has the market-leading position in traffic management systems and delivers advanced transportation solutions to help emergency, transit and traffic personnel increase safety and minimize traffic congestion while maximizing resource efficiency and performance.
Moving to Automation & Specialty components. The platform was slightly down for the quarter as double-digit growth in high-growth markets was mostly offset by weakness at Jacobs Vehicle Systems. JVS saw strong growth in China, offset by continued weakness in the North American truck market. 
The Automation businesses of Kollmorgen and Thompson grew low single digits. This was the second consecutive quarter for positive growth at Kollmorgen, reflecting performance in high-growth markets and collaborative robotics and return to growth for Thompson, which was primarily driven by strength in their distribution channel and medical equipment sales growth.
Continued investment and innovation, including robotics, is driving key market share gains as we continue to outperform the market globally. Our transportation -- our Franchise Distribution platform posted mid-single-digit growth. Once again, Matco grew revenue at high single-digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same-store sales and franchisee adds. 
Hard-line and power tool sales growth was driven by demand generated at our second-largest sales meeting of the year. Matco's mid-single-digit or better core revenue growth record is now at 25 out of the last 27 quarters. We are very proud that Matco's rank is #27 of the fastest-growing franchisees by an entrepreneur magazine.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the quarter. We allocated capital, launched new products, gained market share and realized operating efficiencies across our businesses to deliver great results. We're initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.63 to $0.67, which includes assumptions for low single-digit core revenue growth and incremental growth investments and restructuring. For the second half of 2016, we are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $1.30 to $1.34.
The third quarter of 2016 was a great example of the strength of our portfolio through the cycle. How FBS drives both growth and cost efficiencies and how accelerated revenue growth of high-margin businesses translates to strong operating margin expansion that delivers free cash flow for organic and inorganic investments and superior shareholder returns."

I think if you look at Fluke, just we were very happy about the performance. The Fluke industrial business had a good quarter. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that Western Europe and China was very good. But I think on balance, what we saw in the quarter was stability and a little bit of improvement through some of the product innovations that are going on at Fluke. We talked about Fluke Connect and some of that is helpful, some other product that they've launched here this year. So I think on balance, we've said stabilization. We saw a little bit of a pickup at Fluke as we said in -- and we think that, that should continue. It's really not around easier comps, so we do think is really a little bit of improvement here."

They're great additions to our strategy around positioning our businesses around secular trends, in the case of eMaint really around SaaS-based businesses, 100% SaaS business. In the case of GTT, we're really reframing Transportation Technologies around some of the new trends in urbanization and safety because of traffic congestion. So I think you'd see our deals continue to be those kinds of deals. But we do have a diverse pipeline right now. You can never time when deals will occur. But both the diversity across platforms and size, we're seeing both of those right now. So it's hard to predict when things would occur. We would certainly like to do more sizable transactions. So it's not that we won't -- we'll just be doing small bolt-on deals. You're right in your comment. These are probably -- the return on these are in the lower -- in a fewer years than maybe a larger scale more platform-like deal, but we think balance of that is good for us both short term and long term."

We think that with some of the overage in the quarter that we had, we were obviously, I think, demonstrates the strong earnings potential we have when we get a little bit of core growth. And we just -- we made the decision, I think, you manage the business both for the long and short term, a little bit of incremental growth investment, to double down on the number of things that we think are really important. You heard about a couple of those on the call like consolidation monitoring at Fluke and Gilbarco CMB portfolios so we""re doing a little bit of that. Certainly, as Chuck mentioned, some of our markets are a little noisy, and so there are some product lines and businesses where things are not maybe as good as they need to be, and so we'll take the opportunity to do some things to make sure that those businesses continue to invest next year through taking some costs out. So a good balance of things because it's incremental to our prior guidance important to highlight it. But I think on balance, we're exceptionally excited about the quarter. And I think the degree of freedom that we have in order to invest in the business is really the takeaway for everyone."

The 2 in the quarter were eMaint Enterprises for Fluke, and GTT, which was within our Transportation Technologies platform. Both great businesses, both directed towards secular trends with a good growth profile but small. Those -- the multiples on revenue would probably be higher-than-normal, given the smaller nature of the deal. They're probably closer in the 3x to 4x range in the revenue multiple. But I think the most important thing is around return. And given the nature of how these businesses are consistent with what we're trying to do within those platforms, the return profile is very good. It's certainly within the 10% in 3 years. So I think you'll, from time to time, probably see it pay a little bit more -- pay off a little bit for growth here kinds of things to the platform but probably more than likely in many cases be smaller.

So I think that's a really good trend for us, and we think that probably continues. China continues to lead the way there. That's really a few years of spadework that we've done both on the product side and the go-to-market side to be prepared to take advantage of opportunities there. So I think the team is executing very well there. The North American and Western European markets are still pretty noisy and many of those -- many of the vertical markets we play in are just outright slow. I don't expect that to improve anytime soon. We've also got -- while we don't have a lot of business in the semiconductor industry in North America, you do see a lot of consolidation there. So I think on balance, we think the next couple of quarters continue to be rough.

So I think you see the acquisitions that we have this quarter as well trying to tighten things that even in the tougher industrial environment are going to resonate with customers who are trying for better productivity and safety in their operations. So we think that's still achievable. And as I think we mentioned over time is to get the M&A cycle moving a little bit to accelerate core growth within the platforms, GDP+ is probably achievable as well."

What I was trying to say is that the point-of-sale part of EMV will start to decelerate and the outdoor side of EMV is accelerating. So that's kind of the plus and minus. Just to characterize that, that -- the outdoor opportunities much bigger than the inter-because as you can imagine, there's only 1 or 2 payment devices in inside the store but there might be as many 10 dispensers on the outdoor so the opportunity is much bigger. And so -- and we're just turning to see that. So we'll see good performance in the fourth quarter at Gilbarco against a good -- against of the tough comp so we feel very strongly. To your question about where the growth there is coming from, certainly the U.S. is driving a good chunk of their growth but they're still growing. And so Gilbarco -- I mentioned the share gains they've been having in your, particularly with the major or retail or in into the. But a number of share gains across a number of the customers in Europe and around in many of the high-growth markets. So not every high-growth market is going for them Latin America has been a challenge. A couple other markets have been challenges. They've had good growth in the Middle East.

They're doing a wonderful job of really growing the business, very global business. They did some changes to their go-to-market strategy this year that are -- have some good results as well.

We've been consistent around that. And we think in 2020-ish kind of time frame, it will continue to play out. So that's how we see it. As I mentioned -- relative to growth for next year, we're still looking at funnels. We're still -- still closing business. So we really have a better sense of how much growth that will add to the portfolio. But 100 bps to Fortive is our base case of what we've been talking about. There's nothing to suggest to us at least at this point that, that wouldn't be true. And then finally, on the kits versus dispensers. Certainly more kits in the quarter. Our $500 million market sizing over the next several years sort of takes into account a kit versus dispenser model. And nothing in the quarter would necessarily put us off anything material off that model."

Chuck and I just finished all the strategic plants with our businesses. And clearly, software is finding its way into the strategy and the value proposition of our customers across the portfolio. In terms of highlight, we certainly talked about it with Fluke Connect and the launch of their conditioning monitoring solution, which gives them a SaaS-based solution that they're selling today. We combine that with eMaint. We now have some revenue of SaaS-based. We start now up with the SaaS-based revenue base at Fluke and we'll move from there. It probably won't be material for a couple of years, but the growth rate will be exceptional. Insite360, which is our offering at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, is doing exceptionally well. We've talked about our telematics business. A little bit less revenue growth in telematics this quarter but a very good subscriptions and with almost 0.5 million users of telematics solutions around the world, with all -- with a SaaS-based revenue solution, I think we're in very good position to grow the business. But as I mentioned over time, that really means that it will have a material impact in several years. We'll continue to invest like we did with eMaint. When we find opportunities to accelerate our positions. I think that's what the wonderful part of our ability to deploy capital is Fluke had a computerized maintenance management software in addition to their software portfolio. And we accelerated that strategy by 4 years with the addition of eMaint. So I just exactly what we're going to do around the portfolio and a real opportunity to add a SaaS-based revenue to the portfolio over time."

We're very pleased with our performance this quarter.

We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion, free cash flow, well in excess of net income; and earnings outperformance. The Fortive Business System is the driving force behind our performance and is the cornerstone of both Fortive's culture and operating model.
We recently held the first-ever Fortive CEO kaizen, focused on our key shareholder and customer-facing metrics of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Kaizen means continuous improvement and our kaizen events are one of the many ways we commit to this Fortive value as our way of life. What makes the CEO kaizen unique is that more than 50 of our top leaders across the company go shoulder to shoulder with our front-line operators this year at 4 selected sites to attack our highest priority initiatives. 
The CEO kaizen was an exciting milestone for me personally, and I'm energized by the breakthroughs and amazing results achieved during this event. With the launch of Fortive, we have a great opportunity to deepen our dedication to the Fortive Business System and show the power of 24,000 people devoted to our purpose of providing essential technology for the people who create, implement and accelerate progress.
With that, I would like to turn to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results. The following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the updated supplemental financial data that Lisa described at the top of the call. 
Adjusted net earnings of $233.1 million were up 22.2% over the prior year. Sales grew 2.8% to $1.6 billion, with core revenue increase of 2.7%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 60 basis points of growth over the prior year, which was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Geographically, solid performance in high-growth markets drove revenues up mid-single digits, and developed markets improved to low single-digit growth. The high-growth market results were primarily driven by India and double-digit growth in China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America where we realized a double-digit decline, given continued challenging market conditions.
In developed markets, we saw low single-digit growth in North America, primarily driven by the strength of EMV-related demand for our Gilbarco offerings and strong growth at Matco and Qualitrol, and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. We expect the Western Europe growth to moderate in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was clearly demonstrated with outstanding margin expansion. We were very pleased that 4 out of our 6 platforms had both growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 30 basis points to 49.3%. Operating margins of 20.6% were up 140 basis points versus the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 150 basis points. The strong margin expansion represents above-average incremental fall-through of approximately 75%, reflecting favorable mix and sales growth weighted towards the end of the quarter.
During the third quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, up 50% over the prior year and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 134%. Cash generation was unusually strong this quarter in part due to the timing of interest and tax payments. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be above 100%. 
Our M&A funnel continues to expand, and I remain confident regarding the growth opportunities presented, given the size and diversity of our pipeline. During the quarter, we closed 2 important bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $200 million that accelerates several of our key strategic initiatives, which I will talk a little bit more about later. We expect to remain active on the deal front, with a continued disciplined focus on accelerating growth and returns through our M&A strategy. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter improved to 27.6% versus our previous outlook of 30%. We expect our adjusted rate going forward to be approximately 28%.
Turning to our segments. We were pleased to see improved performance in Professional Instrumentation, with revenue up slightly, reflecting 70 basis points of core growth, partially offset by 40 basis points of currency and 10 basis points from the impact of acquisitions in the separation. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 22.3%, and core operating margins were up 110 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting a favorable business mix to prior year as well as successful price and productivity initiatives. During the quarter, Professional Instrumentation realized approximately 40 basis points of favorable price.
Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single digits, led by demand for test applications and connected equipment monitoring solutions. In field solutions, core revenues were up low single digits, led by mid-single-digit growth at Qualitrol and low single-digit growth at Fluke, reflecting good demand for handheld industrial products as well as our thermography and network offerings. 
Fluke delivered mid-single-digit growth in both Western Europe and China. This strong growth was partially offset by continued weakness in certain North American end markets. Fluke continued to demonstrate the strength of innovation through numerous awards, including 2 Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine Product of the Year awards for Fluke Connected assets in the software maintenance management category and for Fluke TiX560 in the cameras and imaging equipment category. 
During our last earnings call, I highlighted our Fluke Connect, Condition Monitoring System as an example of customer-led innovation. I'm excited to report that the reception to this new product offering has been outstanding. This product is an important step in our connected device strategy, which was recently accelerated via the acquisition of eMaint Enterprises, a global leader in SaaS-based computer -- computerized maintenance management software. 
The combination of Fluke Connect toolbox with eMaint's SaaS offering will allow for increased asset uptime via the seamless integration of maintenance devices data and systems. Fluke and eMaint have joined forces to usher in a new era of connectivity and are set to deliver groundbreaking asset reliability platforms for multi-industrial customers around the world. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was primarily driven by the high-growth markets, where we saw solid asset protection growth and market share gains, driven by the refinement of our go-to-market strategy. This quarter marked Qualitrol's 10th consecutive quarter of positive core growth, and we're excited about our position in this important condition-based monitoring sector. 
In Product Realization, core revenues were slightly up, led by double-digit growth in our PacSci EMC business. The stronger-than-normal EMC growth reflected the timing of several projects that you will recall moved out of last quarter. Year-to-date, EMC delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth.
As expected, Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits and improved sequentially, reflecting sales improvements in nearly all regions and a return to positive growth in our high-growth markets. Tektronix is now our largest business in China, and it continued to outperform in the region by recognizing double-digit growth, given strong demand for our solutions, geared for new way for technology in the semiconductor industry and data center applications.
By leveraging our FBS growth and innovation tools, we've been able to upgrade our 70-gigahertz real-time oscilloscope with advanced software to target data centers where high-quality -- very high-quality signal measurements are critical to ensure data center uptime and performance.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw a low single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter, as declines in our control product lines were partially offset by solid growth in our sensing businesses, which was driven by exposure to the medical and food and beverage verticals. We were pleased to be awarded a multi-year contract with [indiscernible] to supply electrical products to the U.S. Navy, with the potential to realize approximately $300 million -- $3 million in revenue over the next 12 months.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized reported growth of 5.1%, with core revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 90 basis points of growth over prior year, which was offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 21.4%, and core operating margins were up 230 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, productivity as well as material cost and supply chain improvements. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter, with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by our best-in-class retail fueling portfolio. At Gilbarco, we're starting to see a deceleration in EMV-related demand for indoor point-of-sale solutions as the liability transfer occurred in October 2015. However, demand associated with the pending outdoor liability shift in the U.S. has increased for both dispenser and EMV payment kits. While we are in the early innings, growth is weighted towards kits this quarter. 
On the innovation front, Gilbarco recently released contactless and 2D barcode scanner options on FlexPay IV, our market-leading EMV payment platform. 
We are winning not just in the U.S. but in other international markets as well. Our new PCI 4 payment platform continues to gain traction in the market since its launch in Q2, securing our market-leading position, which helped us to close a multimillion dollar 5-year contract with a leading major oil retailer in Italy.
Telematics realized core growth of low single digits in the quarter, reflecting strong international growth. The recent launch of our new SaaS platform called Director has been well received, and the installed base transition will take approximately 18 to 24 months to complete.
In keeping with our Transportation Technologies platform evolution from retail fueling to smart transportation, we closed the acquisition of Global Traffic Technologies or GTT and entered an attractive market adjacency with mid-single-digit or better growth characteristics. GTT has a market-leading position in traffic management systems and delivers advanced transportation solutions to help emergency, transit and traffic personnel increase safety and minimize traffic congestion, while maximizing resource efficiency and performance.
Moving to Automation & Specialty components. The platform was slightly down for the quarter as double-digit growth in high-growth markets was mostly offset by weakness at Jacobs Vehicle Systems. JVS saw strong growth in China, offset by continued weakness in the North American truck market. 
The automation businesses of Kollmorgen and Thomson grew low single digits. This was the second consecutive quarter for positive growth at Kollmorgen, reflecting performance in high-growth markets and collaborative robotics and return to growth for Thomson, which was primarily driven by strength in their distribution channel and medical equipment sales growth.
Continued investment and innovation, including robotics, is driving key market share gains as we continue to outperform the market globally. Our Franchise Distribution platform posted mid-single-digit growth. Once again, Matco grew revenue at high single-digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same-store sales and franchisee adds.
Hard-line and power tool sales growth was driven by demand generated at our second-largest sales meeting of the year. Matco's mid-single-digit or better core revenue growth record is now at 25 out of the last 27 quarters. We are very proud that Matco is ranked as #27 of the fastest-growing franchisees by an entrepreneur magazine.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the quarter. We allocated capital, launched new products, gained market share and realized operating efficiencies across our businesses to deliver great results. We're initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.63 to $0.67, which includes assumptions for low single-digit core revenue growth and incremental growth investments and restructuring. For the second half of 2016, we are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $1.30 to $1.34.
The third quarter of 2016 was a great example of the strength of our portfolio through the cycle. How FBS drives growth -- both growth and cost efficiencies and how accelerated revenue growth of high-margin businesses translates to strong operating margin expansion that delivers free cash flow for organic and inorganic investments and superior shareholder returns."

I think if you looked at Fluke just -- we were very happy about the performance. The Fluke industrial business had a good quarter. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that Western Europe and China was very good. But I think on balance, what we saw in the quarter was stability and a little bit of improvement through some of the product innovations that are going on at Fluke. We talked about Fluke Connect and some of that is helpful, some other products that they've launched here this year. So I think on balance, we've said stabilization. We saw a little bit of a pickup at Fluke as we said, and we think that, that should continue. It's really not around easier comps, so this is -- we do think is really a little bit of improvement here."

They're great additions to our strategy around positioning our businesses around secular trends. In the case of eMaint, really around SaaS-based business, it's a 100% SaaS business. In the case of GTT, we're really reframing Transportation Technologies around some of the new trends in urbanization and safety because of traffic congestion. So I think you'd see our deals continue to be those kinds of deals. But we do have a diverse pipeline right now. You can never time when deals will occur. But both diversity across platforms and size, we're seeing both of those right now. So it's hard to predict when things would occur. We would certainly like to do more sizable transactions. So it's not that we won't -- we'll just be doing small bolt-on deals. You're right in your comment.

We think that with some of the overage in the quarter that we had, we were -- obviously, I think demonstrates the strong earnings potential we have when we get a little bit of core growth. And we made the decision, I think, to manage the business both for the long and short term, a little bit of incremental growth investment, to double down on a number of things that we think are really important. You heard about a couple of those on the call like Condition Monitoring at Fluke and then Gilbarco's EMV portfolio. So we are doing a little bit of that. Certainly, as Chuck mentioned, some of our markets are a little noisy, and so there are some product lines and businesses where things are not maybe as good as they need to be, and so we'll take the opportunity to do some things to make sure that those businesses continue to invest next year through taking some costs out. So a good balance of things. Because it's incremental to our prior guidance, we thought it was important to highlight it. But I think on balance, we're exceptionally excited about the quarter. And I think the degrees of freedom that we have in order to invest in the business is really the takeaway for everyone."

The 2 in the quarter were eMaint Enterprises for Fluke and GTT, which is within our Transportation Technologies platform. Both great businesses. Both directed towards secular trends with a good growth profile, but small. Those -- the multiples on revenue would probably be higher-than-normal given the smaller nature of the deal. They're probably closer in the 3x to 4x range on a revenue multiple. But I think the most important thing is around return. And given the nature of how these businesses are consistent with what we're trying to do within those platforms, the return profile is very good. It's certainly within the 10% in 3 years. So I think you'll, from time to time, probably see us pay a little bit more, pay off a little bit for growth here, kinds of things to the platform, but probably more than likely in many cases be smaller.

So I think that's a really good trend for us, and we think that probably continues. China continues to lead the way there. That's really a few years of spadework that we've done both on the product side and the go-to-market side to be prepared to take advantage opportunities there. So I think the team is executing very well there. The North American and Western European markets are still pretty noisy and many of those -- many of the vertical markets we play in are just outright slow. So I don't expect that to improve anytime soon. We've also got -- while we don't have a lot of business in the semiconductor industry in North America, you do see a lot of consolidation there.

We continue to believe that this is a $500 million incremental market opportunity for the players in the market.

In the case of GTT, they really are helping municipalities. If you think about it quickly, they helped -- they started with the business that helped firetrucks, and other first responders changed the signal in order to go through streets. But they moved into urbanization through a number of things with municipal buses and things like that.

What I was trying to say is that the point-of-sale part of EMV will start to decelerate, and the outdoor side of EMV is accelerating. So that's kind of the plus and the minus. Just to characterize that, that -- the outdoor opportunity is much bigger than the indoor because, as you can imagine, there's only 1 or 2 payment devices inside the store. But there might be as many -- 10 dispensers on the outdoor. So the opportunity is much bigger. And so -- and we're just starting to see that. So we'll see good performance in the fourth quarter at Gilbarco against a good -- against a tough comp. So we feel very strongly. To your question about where the growth there is coming from, certainly, the U.S. is driving a good chunk of their growth, but they're still growing. And so Gilbarco -- I mentioned the share gains they've been having in Europe, particularly with a major oil retailer in Italy. But a number of share gains across a number of big customers in Europe and around in many of the high-growth markets. So not every high-growth market is growing for them. Latin America has been a challenge. A couple other markets have been challenges. They've had good growth in the Middle East. So I think that's where they stand.

So this is a good start but not -- certainly maybe, we've evolved the platform with telematics a few years ago, we've evolved it again with GTT and we'll continue to evolve it over time."

When we think about the whole construction industry in that respect, residential is a very small part of our business. Facilities maintenance, a big part of our business.

So I think when we look at those -- the segments, when we really think about Fluke, it's mostly facilities maintenance, so in many cases, it's the buildings that are already built, if you will."

They're doing a wonderful job of really growing the business, very global business. They did some changes to their go-to-market strategy this year that are -- have some good results as well. So it's not just market, but also, they're making a lot of their own -- walk through some implementation of some good FBS tools."

We've been consistent around that. And we think in 2020-ish kind of time frame, it will continue to play out. So that's how we see it. As I mentioned -- relative to growth for next year, we're still looking at funnels. We're still -- we're obviously still closing business. So we'll really have a better sense of how much growth that will add to the portfolio. But 100 bps to Fortive was -- is our base case of what we've been talking about. There's nothing to suggest to us, at least at this point, that, that wouldn't be true. And then finally, on the kits versus dispensers, certainly more kits in the quarter. Our $500 million market sizing over the next several years sort of takes into account a kit versus dispenser model. And nothing in the quarter would necessarily put us off anything material off that model."

Chuck and I just finished all the strategic plans with our businesses. And clearly, software is finding its way into the strategy and the value proposition of our customers across the portfolio. In terms of highlight, we certainly talked about it with Fluke Connect and the launch of their condition monitoring solution, which gives them a SaaS-based solution that they're selling today. We combine that with eMaint. We now have some revenue of SaaS-based. We start now with a SaaS-based revenue base at Fluke, and we'll move from there. It probably won't be material for a couple of years, but the growth rate will be exceptional. Insite360, which is our offering at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, is doing exceptionally well. We've talked about our telematics business. A little bit less revenue growth in telematics this quarter but a very good subscriptions. And with almost 0.5 million users of telematics solutions around the world, with all -- with a SaaS-based revenue solution, I think we're in very good position to grow the business. But as I mentioned over time, that really means that it will have a material impact in several years. We'll continue to invest like we did with eMaint when we find opportunities to accelerate our positions. I think that's what the wonderful part of our ability to deploy capital is, is Fluke had a computerized maintenance management software addition to their software portfolio, and we accelerated that strategy by 4 years with the addition of eMaint. So I just think that's exactly what we're going to do around the portfolio and a real opportunity to add a SaaS-based revenue to the portfolio over time. Thanks, Patrick. Great to talk to you.

We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid core revenue growth, outstanding margin",1980,"Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid core revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion, free cash flow, well in excess of net income; and earnings outperformance. The Fortive Business System is the driving force behind our performance and is the cornerstone of both Fortive's culture and operating model.
We recently held the first-ever Fortive CEO kaizen, focused on our key shareholder and customer-facing metrics of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Kaizen means continuous improvement and our kaizen events are one of the many ways we commit to this Fortive value as our way of life. What makes the CEO kaizen unique is that more than 50 of our top leaders across the company go shoulder to shoulder with our front-line operators this year at 4 selected sites to attack our highest priority initiatives. 
The CEO kaizen was an exciting milestone for me personally, and I'm energized by the breakthroughs and amazing results achieved during this event. With the launch of Fortive, we have a great opportunity to deepen our dedication to the Fortive Business System and show the power of 24,000 people devoted to our purpose of providing essential technology for the people who create, implement and accelerate progress.
With that, I would like to turn to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results. The following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the updated supplemental financial data that Lisa described at the top of the call. 
Adjusted net earnings of $233.1 million were up 22.2% over the prior year. Sales grew 2.8% to $1.6 billion, with core revenue increase of 2.7%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 60 basis points of growth over the prior year, which was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Geographically, solid performance in high-growth markets drove revenues up mid-single digits, and developed markets improved to low single-digit growth. The high-growth market results were primarily driven by India and double-digit growth in China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America where we realized a double-digit decline, given continued challenging market conditions.
In developed markets, we saw low single-digit growth in North America, primarily driven by the strength of EMV-related demand for our Gilbarco offerings and strong growth at Matco and Qualitrol, and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. We expect the Western Europe growth to moderate in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was clearly demonstrated with outstanding margin expansion. We were very pleased that 4 out of our 6 platforms had both growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 30 basis points to 49.3%. Operating margins of 20.6% were up 140 basis points versus the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 150 basis points. The strong margin expansion represents above-average incremental fall-through of approximately 75%, reflecting favorable mix and sales growth weighted towards the end of the quarter.
During the third quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, up 50% over the prior year and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 134%. Cash generation was unusually strong this quarter in part due to the timing of interest in tax payments. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be above 100%. 
Our M&A funnel continues to expand, and I remain confident regarding the growth opportunities presented, given the size and diversity of our pipeline. During the quarter, we closed 2 important bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $200 million that accelerates several of our key strategic initiatives, which I will talk a little bit more about later. We expect to remain active on the deal front, with a continued disciplined focus on accelerating growth and returns through our M&A strategy. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter improved to 27.6% versus our previous outlook of 30%. We expect our adjusted rate going forward to be approximately 28%.
Turning to our segments. We were pleased to see improved performance in Professional Instrumentation, with revenue up slightly, reflecting 70 basis points of core growth, partially offset by 40 basis points of currency and 10 basis points from the impact of acquisitions in the separation. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 22.3%, and core operating margins were up 110 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting a favorable business mix to prior year as well as successful price and productivity initiatives. During the quarter, Professional Instrumentation realized approximately 40 basis points of favorable price.
Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single digits, led by demand for test applications and connected equipment monitoring solutions. In field solutions, core revenues were up low single digits, led by mid-single-digit growth at Qualitrol and low single-digit growth at Fluke, reflecting good demand for handheld industrial products as well as our thermography and network offerings. 
Fluke delivered mid-single-digit growth in both Western Europe and China. This strong growth was partially offset by continued weakness in certain North American end markets. Fluke continued to demonstrate the strength of innovation through numerous awards, including 2 Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine Product of the Year awards for Fluke Connected assets in the software maintenance management category and for Fluke TiX560 in the cameras and imaging equipment category. 
During our last earnings call, I highlighted our Fluke Connect, Condition Monitoring System as an example of customer-led innovation. I'm excited to report that the reception to this new product offering has been outstanding. This product is an important step in our connected device strategy, which was recently accelerated via the acquisition of eMaint Enterprises, a global leader in SaaS-based computer -- computerized maintenance management software. 
The combination of Fluke Connect toolbox with eMaint's SaaS offering will allow for increased asset uptime via the seamless integration of maintenance devices data and systems. Fluke and eMaint have joined forces to usher in a new era of connectivity and are set to deliver groundbreaking asset reliability platforms for multi-industrial customers around the world. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was primarily driven by the high-growth markets, where we saw solid asset protection growth and market share gains, driven by the refinement of our go-to-market strategy. This quarter marked Qualitrol's 10th consecutive quarter of positive core growth, and we're excited about our position in this important condition-based monitoring sector. 
In Product Realization, core revenues were slightly up, led by double-digit growth in our PacSci EMC business. The stronger-than-normal EMC growth reflected the timing of several projects that you will recall moved out of last quarter. Year-to-date, EMC delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth.
As expected, Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits and improved sequentially, reflecting sales improvements in nearly all regions and a return to positive growth in our high-growth markets. Tektronix is now our largest business in China, and it continued to outperform in the region by recognizing double-digit growth, given strong demand for our solutions, geared for new wafer technology in the semiconductor industry and data center applications.
By leveraging our FBS growth and innovation tools, we've been able to upgrade our 70-gigahertz real-time oscilloscope with advanced software to target data centers where high-quality -- very high-quality signal measurements are critical to ensure data center uptime and performance.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw a low single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter, as declines in our control product lines were partially offset by solid growth in our sensing businesses, which was driven by exposure to the medical and food and beverage verticals. We were pleased to be awarded a multi-year contract with NAVSEA to supply electrical products to the U.S. Navy, with the potential to realize approximately $300 million -- $3 million in revenue over the next 12 months.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized reported growth of 5.1%, with core revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 90 basis points of growth over prior year, which was offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 21.4%, and core operating margins were up 230 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, productivity as well as material cost and supply chain improvements. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter, with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by our best-in-class retail fueling portfolio. At Gilbarco, we're starting to see a deceleration in EMV-related demand for indoor point-of-sale solutions as the liability transfer occurred in October 2015. However, demand associated with the pending outdoor liability shift in the U.S. has increased for both dispenser and EMV payment kits. While we are in the early innings, growth is weighted towards kits this quarter. 
On the innovation front, Gilbarco recently released contactless and 2D barcode scanner options on FlexPay IV, our market-leading EMV payment platform. 
We are winning not just in the U.S. but in other international markets as well. Our new PCI 4 payment platform continues to gain traction in the market since its launch in Q2, securing our market-leading position, which helped us to close a multimillion dollar 5-year contract with a leading major oil retailer in Italy.
Telematics realized core growth of low single digits in the quarter, reflecting strong international growth. The recent launch of our new SaaS platform called Director has been well received, and the installed base transition will take approximately 18 to 24 months to complete.
In keeping with our Transportation Technologies platform evolution from retail fueling to smart transportation, we closed the acquisition of Global Traffic Technologies or GTT and entered an attractive market adjacency with mid-single-digit or better growth characteristics. GTT has a market-leading position in traffic management systems and delivers advanced transportation solutions to help emergency, transit and traffic personnel increase safety and minimize traffic congestion, while maximizing resource efficiency and performance.
Moving to Automation & Specialty components. The platform was slightly down for the quarter as double-digit growth in high-growth markets was mostly offset by weakness at Jacobs Vehicle Systems. JVS saw strong growth in China, offset by continued weakness in the North American truck market. 
The automation businesses of Kollmorgen and Thomson grew low single digits. This was the second consecutive quarter for positive growth at Kollmorgen, reflecting performance in high-growth markets and collaborative robotics and return to growth for Thomson, which was primarily driven by strength in their distribution channel and medical equipment sales growth.
Continued investment and innovation, including robotics, is driving key market share gains as we continue to outperform the market globally. Our Franchise Distribution platform posted mid-single-digit growth. Once again, Matco grew revenue at high single-digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same-store sales and franchisee adds.
Hard-line and power tool sales growth was driven by demand generated at our second-largest sales meeting of the year. Matco's mid-single-digit or better core revenue growth record is now at 25 out of the last 27 quarters. We are very proud that Matco is ranked as #27 of the fastest-growing franchisees by an entrepreneur magazine.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the quarter. We allocated capital, launched new products, gained market share and realized operating efficiencies across our businesses to deliver great results. We're initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.63 to $0.67, which includes assumptions for low single-digit core revenue growth and incremental growth investments and restructuring. For the second half of 2016, we are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $1.30 to $1.34.
The third quarter of 2016 was a great example of the strength of our portfolio through the cycle. How FBS drives growth -- both growth and cost efficiencies and how accelerated revenue growth of high-margin businesses translates to strong operating margin expansion that delivers free cash flow for organic and inorganic investments and superior shareholder returns."

But I think on balance, what we saw in the quarter was stability and a little bit of improvement through some of the product innovations that are going on at Fluke. We talked about Fluke Connect and some of that is helpful, some other products that they've launched here this year. So I think on balance, we've said stabilization. We saw a little bit of a pickup at Fluke as we said, and we think that, that should continue. It's really not around easier comps, so this is -- we do think is really a little bit of improvement here."

They're great additions to our strategy around positioning our businesses around secular trends. In the case of eMaint, really around SaaS-based business, it's a 100% SaaS business. In the case of GTT, we're really reframing Transportation Technologies around some of the new trends in urbanization and safety because of traffic congestion. So I think you'd see our deals continue to be those kinds of deals. But we do have a diverse pipeline right now. You can never time when deals will occur. But both diversity across platforms and size, we're seeing both of those right now. So it's hard to predict when things would occur. We would certainly like to do more sizable transactions. So it's not that we won't -- we'll just be doing small bolt-on deals. You're right in your comment. These are probably -- the return on these are in the lower -- in a fewer years than maybe a larger scale more platform-like deal, but we think balance of that is good for us both short term and long term."

We think that with some of the overage in the quarter that we had, we were -- obviously, I think demonstrates the strong earnings potential we have when we get a little bit of core growth. And we made the decision, I think, to manage the business both for the long and short term, a little bit of incremental growth investment, to double down on a number of things that we think are really important. You heard about a couple of those on the call like Condition Monitoring at Fluke and then Gilbarco's EMV portfolio. So we are doing a little bit of that. Certainly, as Chuck mentioned, some of our markets are a little noisy, and so there are some product lines and businesses where things are not maybe as good as they need to be, and so we'll take the opportunity to do some things to make sure that those businesses continue to invest next year through taking some costs out. So a good balance of things. Because it's incremental to our prior guidance, we thought it was important to highlight it. But I think on balance, we're exceptionally excited about the quarter. And I think the degrees of freedom that we have in order to invest in the business is really the takeaway for everyone."

The 2 in the quarter were eMaint Enterprises for Fluke and GTT, which is within our Transportation Technologies platform. Both great businesses. Both directed towards secular trends with a good growth profile, but small. Those -- the multiples on revenue would probably be higher-than-normal given the smaller nature of the deal. They're probably closer in the 3x to 4x range on a revenue multiple. But I think the most important thing is around return. And given the nature of how these businesses are consistent with what we're trying to do within those platforms, the return profile is very good. It's certainly within the 10% in 3 years. So I think you'll, from time to time, probably see us pay a little bit more, pay up a little bit for growth here, kinds of things to the platform, but probably more than likely in many cases be smaller.

That's really a few years of spadework that we've done both on the product side and the go-to-market side to be prepared to take advantage opportunities there. So I think the team is executing very well there. The North American and Western European markets are still pretty noisy and many of those -- many of the vertical markets we play in are just outright slow. So I don't expect that to improve anytime soon. We've also got -- while we don't have a lot of business in the semiconductor industry in North America, you do see a lot of consolidation there.

In the case of GTT, they really are helping municipalities. If you think about it quickly, they helped -- they started with the business that helped firetrucks, and other first responders changed the signal in order to go through streets. But they moved into urbanization through a number of things with municipal buses and things like that. So they're really very much in the forefront of helping traffic move through cities, and as you can imagine, a pretty big problem, not just in Seattle where we live, but everywhere around the world.

What I was trying to say is that the point-of-sale part of EMV will start to decelerate, and the outdoor side of EMV is accelerating. So that's kind of the plus and the minus. Just to characterize that, that -- the outdoor opportunity is much bigger than the indoor because, as you can imagine, there's only 1 or 2 payment devices inside the store. But there might be as many -- 10 dispensers on the outdoor. So the opportunity is much bigger. And so -- and we're just starting to see that. So we'll see good performance in the fourth quarter at Gilbarco against a good -- against a tough comp. So we feel very strongly. To your question about where the growth there is coming from, certainly, the U.S. is driving a good chunk of their growth, but they're still growing. And so Gilbarco -- I mentioned the share gains they've been having in Europe, particularly with a major oil retailer in Italy. But a number of share gains across a number of big customers in Europe and around in many of the high-growth markets. So not every high-growth market is growing for them. Latin America has been a challenge. A couple other markets have been challenges. They've had good growth in the Middle East. So I think that's where they stand.

They're doing a wonderful job of really growing the business, very global business. They did some changes to their go-to-market strategy this year that are -- have some good results as well.

We've been consistent around that. And we think in 2020-ish kind of time frame, it will continue to play out. So that's how we see it. As I mentioned -- relative to growth for next year, we're still looking at funnels. We're still -- we're obviously still closing business. So we'll really have a better sense of how much growth that will add to the portfolio. But 100 bps to Fortive was -- is our base case of what we've been talking about. There's nothing to suggest to us, at least at this point, that, that wouldn't be true. And then finally, on the kits versus dispensers, certainly more kits in the quarter. Our $500 million market sizing over the next several years sort of takes into account a kit versus dispenser model. And nothing in the quarter would necessarily put us off anything material off that model."

Chuck and I just finished all the strategic plans with our businesses. And clearly, software is finding its way into the strategy and the value proposition of our customers across the portfolio. In terms of highlight, we certainly talked about it with Fluke Connect and the launch of their condition monitoring solution, which gives them a SaaS-based solution that they're selling today. We combine that with eMaint. We now have some revenue of SaaS-based. We start now with a SaaS-based revenue base at Fluke, and we'll move from there. It probably won't be material for a couple of years, but the growth rate will be exceptional. Insite360, which is our offering at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, is doing exceptionally well. We've talked about our telematics business. A little bit less revenue growth in telematics this quarter but a very good subscriptions. And with almost 0.5 million users of telematics solutions around the world, with all -- with a SaaS-based revenue solution, I think we're in very good position to grow the business. But as I mentioned over time, that really means that it will have a material impact in several years. We'll continue to invest like we did with eMaint when we find opportunities to accelerate our positions. I think that's what the wonderful part of our ability to deploy capital is, is Fluke had a computerized maintenance management software addition to their software portfolio, and we accelerated that strategy by 4 years with the addition of eMaint. So I just think that's exactly what we're going to do around the portfolio and a real opportunity to add a SaaS-based revenue to the portfolio over time. Thanks, Patrick. Great to talk to you.

We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid core revenue growth, outstanding margin",1980,"Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid core revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion, free cash flow, well in excess of net income; and earnings outperformance. The Fortive Business System is the driving force behind our performance and is the cornerstone of both Fortive's culture and operating model.
We recently held the first-ever Fortive CEO kaizen, focused on our key shareholder and customer-facing metrics of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Kaizen means continuous improvement and our kaizen events are one of the many ways we commit to this Fortive value as our way of life. What makes the CEO kaizen unique is that more than 50 of our top leaders across the company go shoulder to shoulder with our front-line operators this year at 4 selected sites to attack our highest priority initiatives. 
The CEO kaizen was an exciting milestone for me personally, and I'm energized by the breakthroughs and amazing results achieved during this event. With the launch of Fortive, we have a great opportunity to deepen our dedication to the Fortive Business System and show the power of 24,000 people devoted to our purpose of providing essential technology for the people who create, implement and accelerate progress.
With that, I would like to turn to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results. The following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the updated supplemental financial data that Lisa described at the top of the call. 
Adjusted net earnings of $233.1 million were up 22.2% over the prior year. Sales grew 2.8% to $1.6 billion, with core revenue increase of 2.7%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 60 basis points of growth over the prior year, which was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Geographically, solid performance in high-growth markets drove revenues up mid-single digits, and developed markets improved to low single-digit growth. The high-growth market results were primarily driven by India and double-digit growth in China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America where we realized a double-digit decline, given continued challenging market conditions.
In developed markets, we saw low single-digit growth in North America, primarily driven by the strength of EMV-related demand for our Gilbarco offerings and strong growth at Matco and Qualitrol, and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. We expect the Western Europe growth to moderate in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was clearly demonstrated with outstanding margin expansion. We were very pleased that 4 out of our 6 platforms had both growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 30 basis points to 49.3%. Operating margins of 20.6% were up 140 basis points versus the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 150 basis points. The strong margin expansion represents above-average incremental fall-through of approximately 75%, reflecting favorable mix and sales growth weighted towards the end of the quarter.
During the third quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, up 50% over the prior year and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 134%. Cash generation was unusually strong this quarter in part due to the timing of interest in tax payments. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be above 100%. 
Our M&A funnel continues to expand, and I remain confident regarding the growth opportunities presented, given the size and diversity of our pipeline. During the quarter, we closed 2 important bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $200 million that accelerates several of our key strategic initiatives, which I will talk a little bit more about later. We expect to remain active on the deal front, with a continued disciplined focus on accelerating growth and returns through our M&A strategy. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter improved to 27.6% versus our previous outlook of 30%. We expect our adjusted rate going forward to be approximately 28%.
Turning to our segments. We were pleased to see improved performance in Professional Instrumentation, with revenue up slightly, reflecting 70 basis points of core growth, partially offset by 40 basis points of currency and 10 basis points from the impact of acquisitions in the separation. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 22.3%, and core operating margins were up 110 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting a favorable business mix to prior year as well as successful price and productivity initiatives. During the quarter, Professional Instrumentation realized approximately 40 basis points of favorable price.
Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single digits, led by demand for test applications and connected equipment monitoring solutions. In field solutions, core revenues were up low single digits, led by mid-single-digit growth at Qualitrol and low single-digit growth at Fluke, reflecting good demand for handheld industrial products as well as our thermography and network offerings. 
Fluke delivered mid-single-digit growth in both Western Europe and China. This strong growth was partially offset by continued weakness in certain North American end markets. Fluke continued to demonstrate the strength of innovation through numerous awards, including 2 Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine Product of the Year awards for Fluke Connected assets in the software maintenance management category and for Fluke TiX560 in the cameras and imaging equipment category. 
During our last earnings call, I highlighted our Fluke Connect, Condition Monitoring System as an example of customer-led innovation. I'm excited to report that the reception to this new product offering has been outstanding. This product is an important step in our connected device strategy, which was recently accelerated via the acquisition of eMaint Enterprises, a global leader in SaaS-based computer -- computerized maintenance management software. 
The combination of Fluke Connect toolbox with eMaint's SaaS offering will allow for increased asset uptime via the seamless integration of maintenance devices data and systems. Fluke and eMaint have joined forces to usher in a new era of connectivity and are set to deliver groundbreaking asset reliability platforms for multi-industrial customers around the world. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was primarily driven by the high-growth markets, where we saw solid asset protection growth and market share gains, driven by the refinement of our go-to-market strategy. This quarter marked Qualitrol's 10th consecutive quarter of positive core growth, and we're excited about our position in this important condition-based monitoring sector. 
In Product Realization, core revenues were slightly up, led by double-digit growth in our PacSci EMC business. The stronger-than-normal EMC growth reflected the timing of several projects that you will recall moved out of last quarter. Year-to-date, EMC delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth.
As expected, Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits and improved sequentially, reflecting sales improvements in nearly all regions and a return to positive growth in our high-growth markets. Tektronix is now our largest business in China, and it continued to outperform in the region by recognizing double-digit growth, given strong demand for our solutions, geared for new wafer technology in the semiconductor industry and data center applications.
By leveraging our FBS growth and innovation tools, we've been able to upgrade our 70-gigahertz real-time oscilloscope with advanced software to target data centers where high-quality -- very high-quality signal measurements are critical to ensure data center uptime and performance.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw a low single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter, as declines in our control product lines were partially offset by solid growth in our sensing businesses, which was driven by exposure to the medical and food and beverage verticals. We were pleased to be awarded a multi-year contract with NAVSEA to supply electrical products to the U.S. Navy, with the potential to realize approximately $300 million -- $3 million in revenue over the next 12 months.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized reported growth of 5.1%, with core revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 90 basis points of growth over prior year, which was offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 21.4%, and core operating margins were up 230 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, productivity as well as material cost and supply chain improvements. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter, with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by our best-in-class retail fueling portfolio. At Gilbarco, we're starting to see a deceleration in EMV-related demand for indoor point-of-sale solutions as the liability transfer occurred in October 2015. However, demand associated with the pending outdoor liability shift in the U.S. has increased for both dispenser and EMV payment kits. While we are in the early innings, growth is weighted towards kits this quarter. 
On the innovation front, Gilbarco recently released contactless and 2D barcode scanner options on FlexPay IV, our market-leading EMV payment platform. 
We are winning not just in the U.S. but in other international markets as well. Our new PCI 4 payment platform continues to gain traction in the market since its launch in Q2, securing our market-leading position, which helped us to close a multimillion dollar 5-year contract with a leading major oil retailer in Italy.
Telematics realized core growth of low single digits in the quarter, reflecting strong international growth. The recent launch of our new SaaS platform called Director has been well received, and the installed base transition will take approximately 18 to 24 months to complete.
In keeping with our Transportation Technologies platform evolution from retail fueling to smart transportation, we closed the acquisition of Global Traffic Technologies or GTT and entered an attractive market adjacency with mid-single-digit or better growth characteristics. GTT has a market-leading position in traffic management systems and delivers advanced transportation solutions to help emergency, transit and traffic personnel increase safety and minimize traffic congestion, while maximizing resource efficiency and performance.
Moving to Automation & Specialty components. The platform was slightly down for the quarter as double-digit growth in high-growth markets was mostly offset by weakness at Jacobs Vehicle Systems. JVS saw strong growth in China, offset by continued weakness in the North American truck market. 
The automation businesses of Kollmorgen and Thomson grew low single digits. This was the second consecutive quarter for positive growth at Kollmorgen, reflecting performance in high-growth markets and collaborative robotics and return to growth for Thomson, which was primarily driven by strength in their distribution channel and medical equipment sales growth.
Continued investment and innovation, including robotics, is driving key market share gains as we continue to outperform the market globally. Our Franchise Distribution platform posted mid-single-digit growth. Once again, Matco grew revenue at high single-digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same-store sales and franchisee adds.
Hard-line and power tool sales growth was driven by demand generated at our second-largest sales meeting of the year. Matco's mid-single-digit or better core revenue growth record is now at 25 out of the last 27 quarters. We are very proud that Matco is ranked as #27 of the fastest-growing franchisees by an entrepreneur magazine.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the quarter. We allocated capital, launched new products, gained market share and realized operating efficiencies across our businesses to deliver great results. We're initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.63 to $0.67, which includes assumptions for low single-digit core revenue growth and incremental growth investments and restructuring. For the second half of 2016, we are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $1.30 to $1.34.
The third quarter of 2016 was a great example of the strength of our portfolio through the cycle. How FBS drives growth -- both growth and cost efficiencies and how accelerated revenue growth of high-margin businesses translates to strong operating margin expansion that delivers free cash flow for organic and inorganic investments and superior shareholder returns."

We talked about Fluke Connect and some of that is helpful, some other products that they've launched here this year. So I think on balance, we've said stabilization. We saw a little bit of a pickup at Fluke as we said, and we think that, that should continue. It's really not around easier comps, so this is -- we do think is really a little bit of improvement here."

They're great additions to our strategy around positioning our businesses around secular trends. In the case of eMaint, really around SaaS-based business, it's a 100% SaaS business. In the case of GTT, we're really reframing Transportation Technologies around some of the new trends in urbanization and safety because of traffic congestion. So I think you'd see our deals continue to be those kinds of deals. But we do have a diverse pipeline right now. You can never time when deals will occur. But both diversity across platforms and size, we're seeing both of those right now. So it's hard to predict when things would occur. We would certainly like to do more sizable transactions. So it's not that we won't -- we'll just be doing small bolt-on deals. You're right in your comment. These are probably -- the return on these are in the lower -- in a fewer years than maybe a larger scale more platform-like deal, but we think balance of that is good for us both short term and long term."

We think that with some of the overage in the quarter that we had, we were -- obviously, I think demonstrates the strong earnings potential we have when we get a little bit of core growth. And we made the decision, I think, to manage the business both for the long and short term, a little bit of incremental growth investment, to double down on a number of things that we think are really important. You heard about a couple of those on the call like Condition Monitoring at Fluke and then Gilbarco's EMV portfolio. So we are doing a little bit of that. Certainly, as Chuck mentioned, some of our markets are a little noisy, and so there are some product lines and businesses where things are not maybe as good as they need to be, and so we'll take the opportunity to do some things to make sure that those businesses continue to invest next year through taking some costs out. So a good balance of things. Because it's incremental to our prior guidance, we thought it was important to highlight it. But I think on balance, we're exceptionally excited about the quarter. And I think the degrees of freedom that we have in order to invest in the business is really the takeaway for everyone."

The 2 in the quarter were eMaint Enterprises for Fluke and GTT, which is within our Transportation Technologies platform. Both great businesses. Both directed towards secular trends with a good growth profile, but small. Those -- the multiples on revenue would probably be higher-than-normal given the smaller nature of the deal. They're probably closer in the 3x to 4x range on a revenue multiple. But I think the most important thing is around return. And given the nature of how these businesses are consistent with what we're trying to do within those platforms, the return profile is very good. It's certainly within the 10% in 3 years. So I think you'll, from time to time, probably see us pay a little bit more, pay up a little bit for growth here, kinds of things to the platform, but probably more than likely in many cases be smaller.

So I think that's a really good trend for us, and we think that probably continues. China continues to lead the way there. That's really a few years of spadework that we've done both on the product side and the go-to-market side to be prepared to take advantage opportunities there. So I think the team is executing very well there. The North American and Western European markets are still pretty noisy and many of those -- many of the vertical markets we play in are just outright slow. So I don't expect that to improve anytime soon. We've also got -- while we don't have a lot of business in the semiconductor industry in North America, you do see a lot of consolidation there.

We continue to believe that this is a $500 million incremental market opportunity for the players in the market.

So I think that it starts with that. And as we mentioned, these businesses are under $50 million in revenue. So we think they're great businesses. We can scale them. In the case of GTT, they really are helping municipalities. If you think about it quickly, they helped -- they started with the business that helped firetrucks, and other first responders changed the signal in order to go through streets. But they moved into urbanization through a number of things with municipal buses and things like that. So they're really very much in the forefront of helping traffic move through cities, and as you can imagine, a pretty big problem, not just in Seattle where we live, but everywhere around the world.

What I was trying to say is that the point-of-sale part of EMV will start to decelerate, and the outdoor side of EMV is accelerating. So that's kind of the plus and the minus. Just to characterize that, that -- the outdoor opportunity is much bigger than the indoor because, as you can imagine, there's only 1 or 2 payment devices inside the store. But there might be as many -- 10 dispensers on the outdoor. So the opportunity is much bigger. And so -- and we're just starting to see that. So we'll see good performance in the fourth quarter at Gilbarco against a good -- against a tough comp. So we feel very strongly. To your question about where the growth there is coming from, certainly, the U.S. is driving a good chunk of their growth, but they're still growing. And so Gilbarco -- I mentioned the share gains they've been having in Europe, particularly with a major oil retailer in Italy. But a number of share gains across a number of big customers in Europe and around in many of the high-growth markets. So not every high-growth market is growing for them. Latin America has been a challenge. A couple other markets have been challenges. They've had good growth in the Middle East. So I think that's where they stand.

They're doing a wonderful job of really growing the business, very global business. They did some changes to their go-to-market strategy this year that are -- have some good results as well.

We've been consistent around that. And we think in 2020-ish kind of time frame, it will continue to play out. So that's how we see it. As I mentioned -- relative to growth for next year, we're still looking at funnels. We're still -- we're obviously still closing business. So we'll really have a better sense of how much growth that will add to the portfolio. But 100 bps to Fortive was -- is our base case of what we've been talking about. There's nothing to suggest to us, at least at this point, that, that wouldn't be true. And then finally, on the kits versus dispensers, certainly more kits in the quarter. Our $500 million market sizing over the next several years sort of takes into account a kit versus dispenser model. And nothing in the quarter would necessarily put us off anything material off that model."

Chuck and I just finished all the strategic plans with our businesses. And clearly, software is finding its way into the strategy and the value proposition of our customers across the portfolio. In terms of highlight, we certainly talked about it with Fluke Connect and the launch of their condition monitoring solution, which gives them a SaaS-based solution that they're selling today. We combine that with eMaint. We now have some revenue of SaaS-based. We start now with a SaaS-based revenue base at Fluke, and we'll move from there. It probably won't be material for a couple of years, but the growth rate will be exceptional. Insite360, which is our offering at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, is doing exceptionally well. We've talked about our telematics business. A little bit less revenue growth in telematics this quarter but a very good subscriptions. And with almost 0.5 million users of telematics solutions around the world, with all -- with a SaaS-based revenue solution, I think we're in very good position to grow the business. But as I mentioned over time, that really means that it will have a material impact in several years. We'll continue to invest like we did with eMaint when we find opportunities to accelerate our positions. I think that's what the wonderful part of our ability to deploy capital is, is Fluke had a computerized maintenance management software addition to their software portfolio, and we accelerated that strategy by 4 years with the addition of eMaint. So I just think that's exactly what we're going to do around the portfolio and a real opportunity to add a SaaS-based revenue to the portfolio over time. Thanks, Patrick. Great to talk to you.

We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid core revenue growth, outstanding margin",1980,"Thanks, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter. Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our team's impressive execution to deliver solid core revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion, free cash flow, well in excess of net income; and earnings outperformance. The Fortive Business System is the driving force behind our performance and is the cornerstone of both Fortive's culture and operating model.
We recently held the first-ever Fortive CEO kaizen, focused on our key shareholder and customer-facing metrics of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Kaizen means continuous improvement and our kaizen events are one of the many ways we commit to this Fortive value as our way of life. What makes the CEO kaizen unique is that more than 50 of our top leaders across the company go shoulder to shoulder with our front-line operators this year at 4 selected sites to attack our highest priority initiatives. 
The CEO kaizen was an exciting milestone for me personally, and I'm energized by the breakthroughs and amazing results achieved during this event. With the launch of Fortive, we have a great opportunity to deepen our dedication to the Fortive Business System and show the power of 24,000 people devoted to our purpose of providing essential technology for the people who create, implement and accelerate progress.
With that, I would like to turn to the quarter for a more detailed discussion of our results. The following information reflects year-over-year increases or decreases relative to the updated supplemental financial data that Lisa described at the top of the call. 
Adjusted net earnings of $233.1 million were up 22.2% over the prior year. Sales grew 2.8% to $1.6 billion, with core revenue increase of 2.7%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 60 basis points of growth over the prior year, which was partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Geographically, solid performance in high-growth markets drove revenues up mid-single digits, and developed markets improved to low single-digit growth. The high-growth market results were primarily driven by India and double-digit growth in China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America where we realized a double-digit decline, given continued challenging market conditions.
In developed markets, we saw low single-digit growth in North America, primarily driven by the strength of EMV-related demand for our Gilbarco offerings and strong growth at Matco and Qualitrol, and mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe. We expect the Western Europe growth to moderate in the fourth quarter.
The power of the Fortive Business System was clearly demonstrated with outstanding margin expansion. We were very pleased that 4 out of our 6 platforms had both growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Gross margins expanded 30 basis points to 49.3%. Operating margins of 20.6% were up 140 basis points versus the prior year, with core adjusted operating margin expansion of 150 basis points. The strong margin expansion represents above-average incremental fall-through of approximately 75%, reflecting favorable mix and sales growth weighted towards the end of the quarter.
During the third quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, up 50% over the prior year and delivered an outstanding conversion ratio of 134%. Cash generation was unusually strong this quarter in part due to the timing of interest in tax payments. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be above 100%. 
Our M&A funnel continues to expand, and I remain confident regarding the growth opportunities presented, given the size and diversity of our pipeline. During the quarter, we closed 2 important bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $200 million that accelerates several of our key strategic initiatives, which I will talk a little bit more about later. We expect to remain active on the deal front, with a continued disciplined focus on accelerating growth and returns through our M&A strategy. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter improved to 27.6% versus our previous outlook of 30%. We expect our adjusted rate going forward to be approximately 28%.
Turning to our segments. We were pleased to see improved performance in Professional Instrumentation, with revenue up slightly, reflecting 70 basis points of core growth, partially offset by 40 basis points of currency and 10 basis points from the impact of acquisitions in the separation. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 22.3%, and core operating margins were up 110 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting a favorable business mix to prior year as well as successful price and productivity initiatives. During the quarter, Professional Instrumentation realized approximately 40 basis points of favorable price.
Advanced Instrumentation and Solutions core revenue increased low single digits, led by demand for test applications and connected equipment monitoring solutions. In field solutions, core revenues were up low single digits, led by mid-single-digit growth at Qualitrol and low single-digit growth at Fluke, reflecting good demand for handheld industrial products as well as our thermography and network offerings. 
Fluke delivered mid-single-digit growth in both Western Europe and China. This strong growth was partially offset by continued weakness in certain North American end markets. Fluke continued to demonstrate the strength of innovation through numerous awards, including 2 Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine Product of the Year awards for Fluke Connected assets in the software maintenance management category and for Fluke TiX560 in the cameras and imaging equipment category. 
During our last earnings call, I highlighted our Fluke Connect, Condition Monitoring System as an example of customer-led innovation. I'm excited to report that the reception to this new product offering has been outstanding. This product is an important step in our connected device strategy, which was recently accelerated via the acquisition of eMaint Enterprises, a global leader in SaaS-based computer -- computerized maintenance management software. 
The combination of Fluke Connect toolbox with eMaint's SaaS offering will allow for increased asset uptime via the seamless integration of maintenance devices data and systems. Fluke and eMaint have joined forces to usher in a new era of connectivity and are set to deliver groundbreaking asset reliability platforms for multi-industrial customers around the world. 
Qualitrol's mid-single-digit growth was primarily driven by the high-growth markets, where we saw solid asset protection growth and market share gains, driven by the refinement of our go-to-market strategy. This quarter marked Qualitrol's 10th consecutive quarter of positive core growth, and we're excited about our position in this important condition-based monitoring sector. 
In Product Realization, core revenues were slightly up, led by double-digit growth in our PacSci EMC business. The stronger-than-normal EMC growth reflected the timing of several projects that you will recall moved out of last quarter. Year-to-date, EMC delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth.
As expected, Tektronix core revenues declined low single digits and improved sequentially, reflecting sales improvements in nearly all regions and a return to positive growth in our high-growth markets. Tektronix is now our largest business in China, and it continued to outperform in the region by recognizing double-digit growth, given strong demand for our solutions, geared for new wafer technology in the semiconductor industry and data center applications.
By leveraging our FBS growth and innovation tools, we've been able to upgrade our 70-gigahertz real-time oscilloscope with advanced software to target data centers where high-quality -- very high-quality signal measurements are critical to ensure data center uptime and performance.
Our Sensing Technologies platform saw a low single-digit core revenue decline in the quarter, as declines in our control product lines were partially offset by solid growth in our sensing businesses, which was driven by exposure to the medical and food and beverage verticals. We were pleased to be awarded a multi-year contract with NAVSEA to supply electrical products to the U.S. Navy, with the potential to realize approximately $300 million -- $3 million in revenue over the next 12 months.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. We realized reported growth of 5.1%, with core revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 90 basis points of growth over prior year, which was offset by approximately 50 basis points of currency. 
Reported operating profit margin increased to 21.4%, and core operating margins were up 230 basis points for the quarter, primarily reflecting strong volume growth, productivity as well as material cost and supply chain improvements. 
Our Transportation Technologies platform saw high single-digit growth in the quarter, with Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by our best-in-class retail fueling portfolio. At Gilbarco, we're starting to see a deceleration in EMV-related demand for indoor point-of-sale solutions as the liability transfer occurred in October 2015. However, demand associated with the pending outdoor liability shift in the U.S. has increased for both dispenser and EMV payment kits. While we are in the early innings, growth is weighted towards kits this quarter. 
On the innovation front, Gilbarco recently released contactless and 2D barcode scanner options on FlexPay IV, our market-leading EMV payment platform. 
We are winning not just in the U.S. but in other international markets as well. Our new PCI 4 payment platform continues to gain traction in the market since its launch in Q2, securing our market-leading position, which helped us to close a multimillion dollar 5-year contract with a leading major oil retailer in Italy.
Telematics realized core growth of low single digits in the quarter, reflecting strong international growth. The recent launch of our new SaaS platform called Director has been well received, and the installed base transition will take approximately 18 to 24 months to complete.
In keeping with our Transportation Technologies platform evolution from retail fueling to smart transportation, we closed the acquisition of Global Traffic Technologies or GTT and entered an attractive market adjacency with mid-single-digit or better growth characteristics. GTT has a market-leading position in traffic management systems and delivers advanced transportation solutions to help emergency, transit and traffic personnel increase safety and minimize traffic congestion, while maximizing resource efficiency and performance.
Moving to Automation & Specialty components. The platform was slightly down for the quarter as double-digit growth in high-growth markets was mostly offset by weakness at Jacobs Vehicle Systems. JVS saw strong growth in China, offset by continued weakness in the North American truck market. 
The automation businesses of Kollmorgen and Thomson grew low single digits. This was the second consecutive quarter for positive growth at Kollmorgen, reflecting performance in high-growth markets and collaborative robotics and return to growth for Thomson, which was primarily driven by strength in their distribution channel and medical equipment sales growth.
Continued investment and innovation, including robotics, is driving key market share gains as we continue to outperform the market globally. Our Franchise Distribution platform posted mid-single-digit growth. Once again, Matco grew revenue at high single-digit rate as we continue to gain share via both same-store sales and franchisee adds.
Hard-line and power tool sales growth was driven by demand generated at our second-largest sales meeting of the year. Matco's mid-single-digit or better core revenue growth record is now at 25 out of the last 27 quarters. We are very proud that Matco is ranked as #27 of the fastest-growing franchisees by an entrepreneur magazine.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the quarter. We allocated capital, launched new products, gained market share and realized operating efficiencies across our businesses to deliver great results. We're initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.63 to $0.67, which includes assumptions for low single-digit core revenue growth and incremental growth investments and restructuring. For the second half of 2016, we are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $1.30 to $1.34.
The third quarter of 2016 was a great example of the strength of our portfolio through the cycle. How FBS drives growth -- both growth and cost efficiencies and how accelerated revenue growth of high-margin businesses translates to strong operating margin expansion that delivers free cash flow for organic and inorganic investments and superior shareholder returns."

We talked about Fluke Connect and some of that is helpful, some other products that they've launched here this year. So I think on balance, we've said stabilization. We saw a little bit of a pickup at Fluke as we said, and we think that, that should continue. It's really not around easier comps, so this is -- we do think is really a little bit of improvement here."

They're great additions to our strategy around positioning our businesses around secular trends. In the case of eMaint, really around SaaS-based business, it's a 100% SaaS business. In the case of GTT, we're really reframing Transportation Technologies around some of the new trends in urbanization and safety because of traffic congestion. So I think you'd see our deals continue to be those kinds of deals. But we do have a diverse pipeline right now. You can never time when deals will occur. But both diversity across platforms and size, we're seeing both of those right now. So it's hard to predict when things would occur. We would certainly like to do more sizable transactions. So it's not that we won't -- we'll just be doing small bolt-on deals. You're right in your comment.

We think that with some of the overage in the quarter that we had, we were -- obviously, I think demonstrates the strong earnings potential we have when we get a little bit of core growth. And we made the decision, I think, to manage the business both for the long and short term, a little bit of incremental growth investment, to double down on a number of things that we think are really important. You heard about a couple of those on the call like Condition Monitoring at Fluke and then Gilbarco's EMV portfolio. So we are doing a little bit of that. Certainly, as Chuck mentioned, some of our markets are a little noisy, and so there are some product lines and businesses where things are not maybe as good as they need to be, and so we'll take the opportunity to do some things to make sure that those businesses continue to invest next year through taking some costs out. So a good balance of things. Because it's incremental to our prior guidance, we thought it was important to highlight it. But I think on balance, we're exceptionally excited about the quarter. And I think the degrees of freedom that we have in order to invest in the business is really the takeaway for everyone."

The 2 in the quarter were eMaint Enterprises for Fluke and GTT, which is within our Transportation Technologies platform. Both great businesses. Both directed towards secular trends with a good growth profile, but small. Those -- the multiples on revenue would probably be higher-than-normal given the smaller nature of the deal. They're probably closer in the 3x to 4x range on a revenue multiple. But I think the most important thing is around return. And given the nature of how these businesses are consistent with what we're trying to do within those platforms, the return profile is very good. It's certainly within the 10% in 3 years. So I think you'll, from time to time, probably see us pay a little bit more, pay up a little bit for growth here, kinds of things to the platform, but probably more than likely in many cases be smaller.

That's really a few years of spadework that we've done both on the product side and the go-to-market side to be prepared to take advantage opportunities there. So I think the team is executing very well there. The North American and Western European markets are still pretty noisy and many of those -- many of the vertical markets we play in are just outright slow. So I don't expect that to improve anytime soon. We've also got -- while we don't have a lot of business in the semiconductor industry in North America, you do see a lot of consolidation there.

We continue to believe that this is a $500 million incremental market opportunity for the players in the market. But it's still very early days, and while we like the progress we've made, I certainly think that trying to determine what that mix between kits and dispensers will be is probably a few more quarters here before we really see that.

In the case of GTT, they really are helping municipalities. If you think about it quickly, they helped -- they started with the business that helped firetrucks, and other first responders changed the signal in order to go through streets. But they moved into urbanization through a number of things with municipal buses and things like that. So they're really very much in the forefront of helping traffic move through cities, and as you can imagine, a pretty big problem, not just in Seattle where we live, but everywhere around the world.

What I was trying to say is that the point-of-sale part of EMV will start to decelerate, and the outdoor side of EMV is accelerating. So that's kind of the plus and the minus. Just to characterize that, that -- the outdoor opportunity is much bigger than the indoor because, as you can imagine, there's only 1 or 2 payment devices inside the store. But there might be as many -- 10 dispensers on the outdoor. So the opportunity is much bigger. And so -- and we're just starting to see that. So we'll see good performance in the fourth quarter at Gilbarco against a good -- against a tough comp. So we feel very strongly. To your question about where the growth there is coming from, certainly, the U.S. is driving a good chunk of their growth, but they're still growing. And so Gilbarco -- I mentioned the share gains they've been having in Europe, particularly with a major oil retailer in Italy. But a number of share gains across a number of big customers in Europe and around in many of the high-growth markets. So not every high-growth market is growing for them. Latin America has been a challenge. A couple other markets have been challenges. They've had good growth in the Middle East. So I think that's where they stand.

When we think about the whole construction industry in that respect, residential is a very small part of our business. Facilities maintenance, a big part of our business. Commercial construction, kind of not a real big piece either. So I think when we look at those -- the segments, when we really think about Fluke, it's mostly facilities maintenance, so in many cases, it's the buildings that are already built, if you will."

And in -- obviously, in high-growth markets, you've got the opportunity of expanded infrastructure. So those are really the drivers. They're doing a wonderful job of really growing the business, very global business. They did some changes to their go-to-market strategy this year that are -- have some good results as well. So it's not just market, but also, they're making a lot of their own -- luck through some implementation of some good FBS tools."

Again, while you continue to see maybe some of the big power plants, they're not really tied to the power plant construction as much as they are tied to the infrastructure in terms of getting power to cities.

Relative to the time frame, we still stand by sort of a 5-year time frame, with probably 4 years left. Maybe we'll probably put this year into that 5 years. I think that's what we said. We've been consistent around that. And we think in 2020-ish kind of time frame, it will continue to play out. So that's how we see it. As I mentioned -- relative to growth for next year, we're still looking at funnels. We're still -- we're obviously still closing business. So we'll really have a better sense of how much growth that will add to the portfolio. But 100 bps to Fortive was -- is our base case of what we've been talking about. There's nothing to suggest to us, at least at this point, that, that wouldn't be true. And then finally, on the kits versus dispensers, certainly more kits in the quarter. Our $500 million market sizing over the next several years sort of takes into account a kit versus dispenser model. And nothing in the quarter would necessarily put us off anything material off that model."

It's still a small part of our revenue, but it's an important part of our revenue. I think it's an important part of our story strategically. Chuck and I just finished all the strategic plans with our businesses. And clearly, software is finding its way into the strategy and the value proposition of our customers across the portfolio. In terms of highlight, we certainly talked about it with Fluke Connect and the launch of their condition monitoring solution, which gives them a SaaS-based solution that they're selling today. We combine that with eMaint. We now have some revenue of SaaS-based. We start now with a SaaS-based revenue base at Fluke, and we'll move from there. It probably won't be material for a couple of years, but the growth rate will be exceptional. Insite360, which is our offering at Gilbarco Veeder-Root, is doing exceptionally well. We've talked about our telematics business. A little bit less revenue growth in telematics this quarter but a very good subscriptions. And with almost 0.5 million users of telematics solutions around the world, with all -- with a SaaS-based revenue solution, I think we're in very good position to grow the business. But as I mentioned over time, that really means that it will have a material impact in several years. We'll continue to invest like we did with eMaint when we find opportunities to accelerate our positions. I think that's what the wonderful part of our ability to deploy capital is, is Fluke had a computerized maintenance management software addition to their software portfolio, and we accelerated that strategy by 4 years with the addition of eMaint. So I just think that's exactly what we're going to do around the portfolio and a real opportunity to add a SaaS-based revenue to the portfolio over time. Thanks, Patrick. Great to talk to you.
