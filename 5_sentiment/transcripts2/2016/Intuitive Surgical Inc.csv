Our focus in 2015 was to drive adoption of our platform in general surgery, expand our da Vinci Xi Surgical System product line, increase our organizational capability and performance in international markets and improve contribution margins for our newly launched products. Themes that emerged at the close of 2014 continued into 2015, with strong performance in general surgery and international procedure growth. Full year global procedure growth was approximately 14%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States and strength in urology. U.S. general surgery growth was approximately 31% for the year, made up of strong growth in adrenal hernia repair, ventral hernia repair and colorectal surgery. Use of Single-Site in cholecystectomy and hysterectomy declined for the year. Outside of the United States, procedure growth was strong, rising approximately 26% of the procedures in 2014. Patrick will review procedural trends in greater detail later in the call. 
Looking at the trend in capital sales for the year. Capital placements increased in 2015 to 492 from 431 placements in 2014. Customer interest and acceptance of our latest platform, da Vinci Xi, has been positive, with Xi making up the majority of placements for the year. In 2015, we shipped 298 systems in the United States, 90 in Europe, 77 in Asia and 27 in other global markets. Our operations team remained focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our new products. Partners in the back half of 2015 has been solid, with steady improvements in reducing product costs for new systems and advance instruments. We expect our product cost to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017 as a result of these efforts. 
As we've said before, our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to encompass our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. 2015 was a year in which we focused on enabling our ecosystem with new product launches globally. We launched our da Vinci Xi System with a course of instruments, Vessel Sealer and Firefly fluorescence imaging in 2014. We broadened access to Xi system with international regulatory clearances through the year. We also added our 45-millimeter Xi stapler in Q1, as well as some [indiscernible] shears and a second set of instruments in Q2 of 2015. We submitted our 510(k)s for our 30-millimeter stapler for Xi, Single-Site instrument kit for Xi as well as other Xi accessories in the second half of 2015. I'm pleased to report that we obtained FDA clearance for integrated Xi table motion this month. 
In addition the products, our surgeon customers can choose from dozens of training courses provided by academic surgeons as well as courses designed for assistance and other operating room staff. Our customers own over 1,400 surgical simulators and over 600 new consoles system and technology training. In addition, our teams have provided detailed analytic and operational support for customers seeking to optimize and benchmark programs relative to international norms. We believe the combination of these products and services are important to fully enable our customers. 
Looking back at the full year 2015. Our operating performance is summarized as follows: Global procedures grew by approximately 14%. We shipped 492 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 431 in 2014. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 12% from 2014 and up 15% on a constant-currency basis. The recurring revenue grew to $1.7 billion, up 11% and comprising 70% of total revenue. We generated $946 million in pro forma operating profit, up 16% from last year. Pro forma net income was $731 million, up 20% from 2014, and we repurchased 366,000 shares at an average price of $502 per share during 2015. 
Turning to operating performance for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the fourth quarter of last year. We shipped 158 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 137 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $677 million, up 13% from prior year. Instrument accessory revenue increased to $326 million, up 16%. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $293 million in the quarter, up 28% from the fourth quarter last year, and pro forma net income was $224 million, up 22% from Q4 of 2014. 
As we look to the future, we passionately believe that robotic-assisted surgery is in its infancy in application and technology. As we have improved our cost and supply chains for new products, we anticipate increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. These include product investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics. We will also continue to invest in procedure, product and program analytics, international market development and economic and clinical validation. 
Looking to 2016, our priorities are as follows: first, we'll focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, we'll work to advance our ecosystem, expand -- including expanding our Xi line and taking our XP product line into initial clinical use. Third, we'll drive our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, we'll continue to assist our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."
30239,319152206,920058,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior-year Xi trade-in programs, legal settlements and legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and inve",1404,"Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior-year Xi trade-in programs, legal settlements and legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investor impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Pro forma fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, an increase of 13% compared with $601 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and an increase of 15% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 excludes $4 million of revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si products for Xi product. All trade-out offers are either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. 
Fourth quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 177,000 increased 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Procedure growth was primarily driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S. and urology worldwide. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: pro forma instrument accessory revenue increased 16% [ph] compared with last year and increased 9% compared with the third quarter 2015. The increase relative to prior year reflects procedure growth and increased sales of advance instruments, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase over the prior quarter reflects procedure growth and sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by customer buying patterns. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past year with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Pro forma system revenue of $231 million increased 9% compared with last year and increased 32% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased unit sales. The increase relative to the third quarter reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by lower ASPs. 158 systems were placed in the fourth quarter compared with 137 systems in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 117 systems last quarter. Approximately 72% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xis, which is comparable to prior quarter. Globally, our average system price of $1,550,000 is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014 and slightly less than the $1,600,000 ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, increases related to the lower trade-in mix were up -- mostly offset by foreign exchange. The decrease relative to the third quarter reflects geographic mix and a lower proportion of Xi dual consoles. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix, trade-in volumes and changes in foreign exchange rate. Hospitals financed approximately 17% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 25% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases, 16, since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 49 of the 3,597 systems out in the field were under operating leases. We exclude the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. 
Service revenue, $120 million, increased 9% year-over-year and increased 2% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base for da Vinci system. 
Outside of U.S. results were as follows: fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $219 million increased 11% compared with $198 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 45% compared with $151 million last quarter. The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher system unit sales and higher recurring revenue driven by procedure growth of 27%. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 75 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 37 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales include 13 into China, 11 into Japan, 8 into Italy and 7 into Brazil. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation. 
The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 69.6% compared with 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, the higher gross margin reflects lower inventory charges, improved efficiencies, partially offset by foreign exchange and higher mix of our newer products, which carry lower gross margins than our mature products. Gross margin includes the impact of the medical device tax, which has been suspended for the next 2 years. The medical device tax reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products on whether we are required to pay the medical device tax and costs associated with manufacturing efficiencies and product charges. 
In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product and legal liability claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost for settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the second half of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. As of the end of the fourth quarter, $24 million were made accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated costs have been paid. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. Year-over-year increase of pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount addition and higher incentive compensation. The increase relative to the third quarter primarily reflects increased incentive compensation. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 18.4% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. In late December, Congress renewed the federal research and development credit, resulting in a benefit of $6 million or $0.17 per share. Congress also made the R&D tax credit permanent, so our 2016 rate guidance will reflect this benefit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. 
Our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $224 million or $5.89 per share compared with $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $605 million for the fourth quarter 2014 and $590 million for the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015. 
We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.3 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 167,000 shares for $84 million at an average price of $505 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases for 2015 to approximately $184 million. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."
30239,319152206,920058,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12%, international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14%, with U.S",864,"Thanks, Marshall. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12%, international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 26%. 
In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth of approximately 12% was driven by continued strength in general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. We do not expect a strong 2015 growth in established U.S. urology and gynecology procedures to continue in 2016. In U.S. urology, fourth quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued in similar rates as early in the year. We continue to believe the U.S. prostatectomy volumes has been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 2015 procedure growth in U.S. urology was approximately 12%, led by an approximate 11% growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy. We expect U.S. da Vinci Prostatectomy procedure volumes to return to a level more in line with prostate cancer incidence rates moving forward. 
In U.S. gynecology, fourth quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. During 2015, a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists compared to 2014. For the year, growth in U.S. gynecology procedures was approximately 1%. In 2016, sustaining growth in U.S. gynecology may be a challenge as we believe the total market for benign hysterectomies will continue to decline at a low single-digit rate. 
Fourth quarter growth in U.S. general surgery remains strong with robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. U.S. general surgery procedure growth was approximately 31% for the year with broad-based growth across several procedures, led by hernia repair, which generated the largest number of new general surgery procedures. Growth in colorectal resections was also strong during 2015.  In 2016, there remains a large opportunity in hernia repair and colorectal resections, and driving adoption in these markets remains among our top priorities. 
During the quarter, a group of general surgeons, led by Dr. Vorst from St. Joseph Mercy Health System and Dr. Carbonell from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine published their perspective on advances in ventral and incisional hernia repair in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery. Within the paper, they have been comparing the robotic to open [indiscernible] technique for more complex hernias, favored the robotic approach with the reduction of blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, fewer surgical site infections and no difference in operative times or direct costs. The paper states that robotic approach ""permits relatively easy access to the anterior abdominal wall, allowing the surgeon to perform the ideal repair for that patient. It also might allow for standardization of surgical technique in order to develop a reliable approach to hernia repair that can be offered to an increasing number of patients."" 
Regarding our U.S. Single-Site business, cholecystectomy volumes continued to decline during the fourth quarter, but mostly offset by growth in multiport cholecystectomies. In addition, our Single-Site gynecology procedure volumes declined in the fourth quarter. Taken together, Single-Site procedures represented less than 5% of our fourth quarter U.S. procedure volume. 
Looking abroad during the fourth quarter. The approximate 27% international procedure growth was led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. For the full year, procedure growth was approximately 26%. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady throughout 2015. In Asia, procedure growth was led by broad-based adoption in China and South Korea and da Vinci Prostatectomy adoption in Japan. During 2016, we expect several external factors to impact international procedure growth. In Japan, the Surgical Society have submitted full reimbursement of partial nephrectomies to the MHLW. And MHLW's decision, this makes services [indiscernible] to Japanese procedure growth. In China, we placed 32 of the 38 da Vinci systems on the current authorization. And sustaining strong procedure growth throughout 2016, they require additional authorization from the government. 
During the quarter, the global evidence for the cost-effectiveness for the use of da Vinci surgery in gynecologic oncology continue to build. A new study from Copenhagen University Hospital by Dr. Hurley and colleagues modeled the clinical and economic impact of the adoption of da Vinci for malignant hysterectomies, capturing the comprehensive cost of care associated with these interventions. The study compared 158 open hysterectomies to 202 da Vinci hysterectomies and found the da Vinci hysterectomies were 17% less expensive than open hysterectomies based on operating costs and 7% less expensive than open hysterectomies when the da Vinci system cost was included. The study found that cost savings associated with fewer complications and shorter hospitalization more than offset the incremental cost associated with the use of da Vinci technology in the operating room. 
2015 was a robust year for clinical publications featuring da Vinci surgery with over 1,600 papers published during the year, bringing total clinical publications to over 10,000. 
This concludes my remarks. I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. We have described in our announcement last week, 2015 saw da Vinci procedures grew approximately 14% to roughly 652,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2016, we anticipate full year procedure growth within the range of 9% to 12%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2016 as we've experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. 
With respect to revenue, we expect 2016 capital sale to follow historical seasonal patterns, which we anticipate will become more pronounced with Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. [ph] System placements will likely continue to be lumpy, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. as some of these markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales in some markets are constrained by government regulation. 
Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2016 grew pro forma gross profit margin to be within the range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product and regional mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. As Gary mentioned, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. We expect to grow 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $20 million and $25 million in 2016. With regard to income tax, we expect our 2015 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits. This forecast does reflect the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2016.

As we look at it, value and competition, at the end of the day, value is going to be driven by the ability of these products and services to drive their outcomes and compared or weighed against the price of those things. We think about it as the ecosystem. We think the ecosystem is really important. So it's easy to think just about the robotic system because that's the most visible part, but there's the system, the instruments and accessories, advanced instrumentation like stapling, imaging systems, fluorescence imaging, training technologies like simulators and build console, clinical validation, training courses offered by academic surgeons that number in the dozens, that whole set of products and ecosystem we think is important. So as competitors enter, they have to choose. Can they show that value in terms of outcomes and price? And can they offer the set of ecosystem elements that are going to be useful? We've known for years, and have anticipated for years, we didn't wake up yesterday and think, ""Competitors are coming. We better do something."" So we've been thoughtful about what we need to do to create value for our customers. We have a range of products in the system side that hits different price points for different feature content. We have different options available in terms of instrumentation, instrumentation price points. And so we feel we are well positioned. There are some other companies out there that will be capable. We expect the customers will explore what they're offering. We think we're well positioned when that exploration occurs."

At the same time, as compared with second half of 2015, we expect a higher proportion of 2016 sales to be of newer products. We do expect a lower proportion of dual console system sales, probably higher proportion of system sales involving trade-ins and probably some product charges, at some point, will be more in line with historical norms from the past. And FX is not likely to be a strong a headwind as it was in 2015, it doesn't appear as though we'll have some negative impact on revenue and margins. And then lastly, I'd say that from a competitive side, any pressure there, the impacts there are unknown at this stage."

I think there's great potential there. On the instrumentation side, we're expanding our stapling line and our advanced energy lines. The reception has been quite good. Those are not single instruments. They're really families of instruments, and we're filling out those families as we go. We feel good about it and think it's important we'll continue to invest there. And we think opportunities in robotics, in terms of both structure and things like Sp and other things that can change different segments of the market. They can allow us to enter other procedures that we're not currently in today or access other regions of the world that may have different needs. And so we'll continue to invest in those things."

With regard to the TVs of the Single-Site, we think that Sp really enters and add value in a different place than Single-Site. Single-Site tended to work on a little bit more limited workspace, a little bit more constrained set of procedures. Sp is more broader and more capable. Price points are a little bit different. So we think about Sp when we think transoral, trans-anal, colorectal, places where there's specimen removal. So we look at those things, and we think about it.

Our focus in 2015 was to drive adoption of our platform in general surgery, expand our da Vinci Xi Surgical System product line, increase our organizational capability and performance in international markets and improve contribution margins for our newly launched products. Themes that emerged at the close of 2014 continued into 2015, with strong performance in general surgery and international procedure growth. 
Full year global procedure growth was approximately 14%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States and strength in urology. U.S. general surgery growth was approximately 31% for the year, made up of strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair and colorectal surgery. Use of Single-Site in cholecystectomy and hysterectomy declined for the year. Outside of the United States, procedure growth was strong, rising approximately 26% of the procedures in 2014. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year. Capital placements increased in 2015 to 492 from 431 placements in 2014. Customer interest and acceptance of our latest platform, da Vinci Xi, has been positive, with Xi making up the majority of placements for the year. In 2015, we shipped 298 systems in the United States, 90 in Europe, 77 in Asia and 27 in other global markets. Our operations teams remained focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our newer products. Orders in the back half of 2015 has been solid, with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems and advanced instruments. We expect our product cost to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017 as a result of these efforts. 
As we've said before, our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to encompass our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. 2015 was a year in which we focused on enabling our ecosystem with new product launches globally. We launched our da Vinci Xi System with a core set of instruments, Vessel Sealer and Firefly Fluorescence Imaging in 2014. We broadened access to our Xi system with international regulatory clearances through the year. We also added our 45-millimeter Xi stapler in Q1 as well as Harmonic Curved Shears and a second set of instruments in Q2 of 2015. We submitted our 510(k)s for our 30-millimeter stapler for Xi, Single-Site instrument kit for Xi as well as other Xi accessories in the second half of 2015. I'm pleased to report that we obtained FDA clearance for Integrated Xi Table Motion this month. In addition to products, our surgeon customers can choose from dozens of training courses provided by academic surgeons as well as courses designed for assistance and other operating room staff. Our customers own over 1,400 surgical simulators and over 600 dual consoles to assist them in technology training. In addition, our teams have provided detailed analytic and operational support for customers seeking to optimize and benchmark their programs relative to international norms. We believe the combination of these products and services are important to fully enable our customers. 
Looking back at the full year of 2015. Our operating performance is summarized as follows: Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 14%. We shipped 492 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 431 in 2014. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 12% from 2014 and up 15% on a constant-currency basis. The recurring revenue grew to $1.7 billion, up 11% and comprising 70% of total revenue. We generated $946 million in pro forma operating profit, up 16% from last year. Pro forma net income was $731 million, up 20% from 2014, and we repurchased 366,000 shares at an average price of $502 per share during 2015. 
Turning to operating performance for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the fourth quarter of last year. We shipped 158 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 137 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $677 million, up 13% from prior year. Instrument accessory revenue increased to $326 million, up 16%. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $293 million in the quarter, up 28% from the fourth quarter of last year; and pro forma net income was $224 million, up 22% from Q4 of 2014. 
As we look to the future, we passionately believe that robotic-assisted surgery is in its infancy in application and technology. As we have improved our cost and supply chains for new products, we anticipate increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. These include product investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics. We will also continue to invest in procedure, product and program analytics, international market development and economic and clinical validation. 
Looking to 2016, our priorities are as follows: First, we'll focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, we'll work to advance our ecosystem, expand -- including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product line into initial clinical use. Third, we'll drive our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, we'll continue to assist our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi-traded programs, legal settlements and legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investor impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Pro forma fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, an increase of 13% compared with $601 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and an increase of 15% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 excludes $4 million of revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si products or Xi product. All trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. 
Fourth quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 177,000 increased 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Procedure growth was primarily driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S., in urology worldwide. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: Pro forma instrument accessory revenue increased 16% compared with last year and increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The increase relative to prior year reflects procedure growth and increased sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase over the prior quarter reflects procedure growth and sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by customer-buying patterns. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past year with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Pro forma system revenue of $231 million increased 9% compared with last year and increased 32% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased unit sales. The increase relative to the third quarter reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by lower ASPs. 158 systems were placed in the fourth quarter compared with 137 systems in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 117 systems last quarter. Approximately 72% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xis, which is comparable to prior quarter. 
Globally, our average system price of $1,550,000 was comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014 and slightly less than the $1,600,000 ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, increases related to a lower trade-in mix were up -- mostly offset by foreign exchange. The decrease relative to the third quarter reflects geographic mix and a lower proportion of Xi dual consoles. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rate. Hospitals financed approximately 17% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 25% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases, 16, since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 49 of the 3,597 systems out in the field were under operating leases. We exclude the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. 
Service revenue of $120 million increased 9% year-over-year and increased 2% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base for da Vinci system. 
Outside of U.S. results were as follows: Fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $219 million increased 11% compared with $198 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 45% compared with $151 million last quarter. The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher system unit sales and higher recurring revenue driven by procedure growth of 27%. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 75 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 37 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales include 13 into China, 11 into Japan, 8 into Italy and 7 into Brazil. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation. 
The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 69.6% compared with 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, the higher gross margin reflects lower inventory charges, improved efficiencies, partially offset by foreign exchange and a higher mix of our newer products, which carry lower gross margins than our mature products. Gross margin includes the impact of the medical device tax, which has been suspended for the next 2 years. The medical device tax reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products on whether we are required to pay the medical device tax and costs associated with manufacturing efficiencies and product charges. 
In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product and legal liability claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost for the settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the second half of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. As of the end of the fourth quarter, $24 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated costs have been paid. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. Year-over-year increase of pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount addition and higher incentive compensation. The increase relative to the third quarter primarily reflects increased incentive compensation. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 18.4% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. In late December, Congress renewed the federal research and development credit, resulting in a benefit of $6 million or $0.17 per share. Congress also made the R&D tax credit permanent, so our 2016 rate guidance will reflect this benefit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. 
Our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $224 million or $5.89 per share compared with $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $605 million for the fourth quarter 2014 and $590 million for the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015. 
We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.3 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 167,000 shares for $84 million at an average price of $505 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases for 2015 to approximately $184 million. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."
30239,319152206,920126,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12%, international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14%, with U.S",870,"Thanks, Marshall. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12%, international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 26%. 
In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth of approximately 12% was driven by continued strength in general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. We do not expect a strong 2015 growth in established U.S. urology and gynecology procedures to continue in 2016. In U.S. urology, fourth quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rates as early in the year. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes had been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 2015 procedure growth in U.S. urology was approximately 12%, led by an approximate 11% growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy. We expect U.S. da Vinci Prostatectomy procedure volumes to return to a level more in line with prostate cancer incidence rates moving forward. 
In U.S. gynecology, fourth quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. During 2015, a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists compared to 2014. For the year, growth in U.S. gynecology procedures was approximately 1%. In 2016, sustaining growth in U.S. gynecology may be a challenge as we believe the total market for benign hysterectomies will continue to decline at a low single-digit rate. 
Fourth quarter growth in U.S. general surgery remains strong, with robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. U.S. general surgery procedure growth was approximately 31% for the year with broad-based growth across several procedures, led by hernia repair, which generated the largest number of new general surgery procedures. Growth in colorectal resections was also strong during 2015.  In 2016, there remains a large opportunity in hernia repair and colorectal resections, and driving adoption in these markets remains among our top priorities. 
During the quarter, a group of general surgeons led by Dr. Vorst from St. Joseph Mercy Health System and Dr. Carbonell from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine published their perspective on advances in ventral and incisional hernia repair in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery. Within the paper, data comparing the robotic to open Rives-Stoppa technique for more complex hernias favored the robotic approach with the reduction of blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, fewer surgical site infections and no difference in operative times or direct costs. The paper states that robotic approach ""permits relatively easy access to the anterior abdominal wall, allowing the surgeon to perform the ideal repair for that patient. It also might allow for standardization of surgical technique in order to develop a reliable approach to hernia repair that can be offered to an increasing number of patients."" 
Regarding our U.S. Single-Site business, cholecystectomy volumes continued to decline during the fourth quarter but mostly offset by growth in multiport cholecystectomies. In addition, our Single-Site gynecology procedure volumes declined in the fourth quarter. Taken together, Single-Site procedure represented less than 5% of our fourth quarter U.S. procedure volume. 
Looking abroad during the fourth quarter, the approximate 27% international procedure growth was led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. For the full year, procedure growth was approximately 26%. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady throughout 2015. In Asia, procedure growth was led by broad-based adoption in China and South Korea and da Vinci Prostatectomy adoption in Japan. 
During 2016, we expect several external factors to impact international procedure growth. In Japan, the Surgical Society have submitted full reimbursement of partial nephrectomies to the MHLW. And in the MHLW's decision, this may serve as a tail end to Japanese procedure growth. In China, we placed 32 of the 38 da Vinci systems under the current authorization. And sustaining strong procedure growth throughout 2016, they require additional authorizations from the government. 
During the quarter, the global evidence for the cost effectiveness for the use of da Vinci surgery in gynecologic oncology continued to build. A new study from Copenhagen University Hospital by Dr. Hurley [ph] and colleagues modeled the clinical and economic impact of the adoption of da Vinci for malignant hysterectomies, capturing the comprehensive cost of care associated with these interventions. The study compared 158 open hysterectomies to 202 da Vinci hysterectomies and found the da Vinci hysterectomies were 17% less expensive than open hysterectomies based on operating costs and 7% less expensive than open hysterectomies when the da Vinci system cost was included. The study found that cost savings associated with fewer complications and shorter hospitalization more than offset the incremental costs associated with the use of da Vinci technology in the operating room. 
2015 was a robust year for clinical publications featuring da Vinci surgery with over 1,600 papers published during the year, bringing total clinical publications to over 10,000. 
This concludes my remarks. I thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement last week, 2015 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 14% to roughly 652,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2016, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 9% to 12%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2016 as we've experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. 
With respect to revenue, we expect 2016 capital sale to follow historical seasonal patterns, which we anticipate will become more pronounced, with Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. System placements will likely continue to be lumpy, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. as some of these markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product and regional mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. As Gary mentioned, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. We expect to grow 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $20 million and $25 million in 2016. 
With regard to income tax, we expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits. This forecast does reflect the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2016. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

As we look at it, value and competition, at the end of the day, value is going to be driven by the ability of these products and services to drive great outcomes and compared or weighed against the price of those things. We think about it as an ecosystem. We think the ecosystem is really important. So it's easy to think just about the robotic system because that's the most visible part, but there's the system, the instruments and accessories, advanced instrumentation like stapling, imaging systems, fluorescence imaging, training technologies like simulators and dual console, clinical validation, training courses offered by academic surgeons that number in the dozens, that whole set of products and ecosystem we think is important. And so as competitors enter, they have to choose. Can they show that value in terms of outcomes and price? And can they offer the set of ecosystem elements that are going to be useful? We've known for years, and have anticipated for years, we didn't wake up yesterday and think, ""Competitors are coming. We better do something."" And so we've been thoughtful about what we need to do to create value for our customers. We have a range of products in the system side that hits different price points for different feature content. We have different options that are available in terms of instrumentation price points, and so we think we're really well positioned. There are some other companies out there.  They'll be capable. We expect that customers will explore what they're offering. We think we're well positioned when that exploration occurs."

We're pleased with the progress we've been making throughout 2015. Our second half 2015 gross profit benefited from favorable product mix, essentially 0 product charges and other favorable outcomes. In 2016, we do expect to deliver continued cost reductions on the newer products, including the Xi stapler, Vessel Sealer and Xi endoscopes. At the same time, as compared with the second half of 2015, we'd expect a higher proportion of 2016 sales to be of the newer products. We'd expect a lower proportion of dual console system sales, probably a higher proportion of system sales involving trade-ins and probably some product charges, at some point, will be more aligned with historical norms from the past. And while FX is not likely to be a strong headwind as it was in 2015, it doesn't appear as though we'll have some negative impact on revenue and margins. And then lastly, I'd say that from a competitive side, any pressure there, the impacts there [ph] are unknown at this stage."

Yes, in terms of the balance of investment, it really is targeted in a couple of areas.

So that's where the balance or the bulk of that increase is going to lay in. And we think we have technologies that are important, and we think we have process that we can bring that's important and that will serve us well in the long term in the future. With regard to Sp vis-à-vis Single-Site, we think that Sp really enters and add value in a different place than Single-Site does. Single-Site tended to work on a little bit more limited workspace, a little bit more constrained set of procedures. Sp is both broader and more capable. Price points are a little bit different. So when you think about Sp, when we think transoral, transanal, colorectal, places where there's specimen removal. So we look at those things, and we think about it.

Distal chip imaging, it gives us room to do some things from a usability, reach and workflow point of view that were very hard to do otherwise, and so we continue down that pathway. So for example, in Xi, you can move a scope arm to arm. There's not a dedicated robot to hold one endoscope. So that gives you the idea of port hopping, the ability to look around the abdomen differently. The other thing that distal chip imaging gets you is the ability to articulate your endoscope, which is a part of the Sp product line, is endoscopic articulation. We continue to invest in that sort of technologies and extend our leadership position there because I think that both, you can get better image quality and more flexibility and better price points by doing that technology. So that's one set of investments. The other set is as we've mentioned with Firefly, the ability to look and see things that you can't see easily with a white light, so the ability to look and see beneath tissue or to highlight tissue structure. And there are a set of technologies there that are useful and we're investing in, but those are longer term. They take a while to develop, and as we get further down the pipeline, we'll share with you where we are."

One of them is that I think in the architectures we're in today, our [indiscernible] in the markets for which we have clearances, there's still a lot of procedures that are being done open and have opportunity to be done minimally invasively with our products, and I think that is -- comes down to execution and delivery of some of the things we have in the pipeline. Having said that, I think that as you just stand back and look out over the next decade and ask do we think that robotic-assisted surgery can impact more procedures and more types of procedures than are -- they are being impacted today, I think the answer to that is absolutely yes. Some things or things like Sp, products that look different, Sp won't be the last set of products that look different. We think there are opportunities for other products and technologies that can really make difference in surgeons delivering great care. And so we're excited about it and we're investing in it. And I think asked just about any surgeon, do you think the use of computation analytics in robotics is going to improve your practice over time or become less important, and the answer is pretty uniform that those kinds of technologies should help them if they're well delivered and well executed."

Our focus in 2015 was to drive adoption of our platform in general surgery, expand our da Vinci Xi Surgical System product line, increase our organizational capability and performance in international markets and improve contribution margins for our newly launched products. Themes that emerged at the close of 2014 continued into 2015, with strong performance in general surgery and international procedure growth. 
Full year global procedure growth was approximately 14%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States and strength in urology. U.S. general surgery growth was approximately 31% for the year, made up of strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair and colorectal surgery. Use of Single-Site in cholecystectomy and hysterectomy declined for the year. Outside of the United States, procedure growth was strong, rising approximately 26% over the procedures in 2014. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
Looking at trends in capital sales for the year. Capital placements increased in 2015 to 492 from 431 placements in 2014. Customer interest and acceptance of our latest platform, da Vinci Xi, has been positive, with Xi making up the majority of placements for the year. In 2015, we shipped 298 systems in the United States, 90 in Europe, 77 in Asia and 27 in other global markets. Our operations teams remained focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our newer products. Progress in the back half of 2015 has been solid, with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems and advanced instruments. We expect our product costs to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017 as a result of these efforts. 
As we've said before, our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to encompass our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. 2015 was a year in which we focused on enabling our ecosystem with new product launches globally. We launched our da Vinci Xi System with a core set of instruments, Vessel Sealer and Firefly Fluorescence Imaging in 2014. We broadened access to our Xi system with international regulatory clearances through the year. We also added our 45-millimeter Xi stapler in Q1 as well as Harmonic Curved Shears and a second set of instruments in Q2 of 2015. We submitted our 510(k)s for our 30-millimeter stapler for Xi, Single-Site instrument kit for Xi as well as other Xi accessories in the second half of 2015. I'm pleased to report that we obtained FDA clearance for Integrated Xi Table Motion this month. In addition to products, our surgeon customers can choose from dozens of training courses provided by academic surgeons as well as courses designed for assistants and other operating room staff. Our customers own over 1,400 surgical simulators and over 600 dual consoles to assist them in technology training. In addition, our teams have provided detailed analytic and operational support for customers seeking to optimize and benchmark their programs relative to international norms. We believe the combination of these products and services are important to fully enable our customers. 
Looking back at the full year of 2015. Our operating performance is summarized as follows. Worldwide procedures grew by approximately 14%. We shipped 492 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year, up from 431 in 2014. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, up 12% from 2014 and up 15% on a constant-currency basis. The recurring revenue grew to $1.7 billion, up 11% and comprising 70% of total revenue. We generated $946 million in pro forma operating profit, up 16% from last year. Pro forma net income was $731 million, up 20% from 2014, and we repurchased 366,000 shares at an average price of $502 per share during 2015. 
Turning to operating performance for the fourth quarter. Procedures grew approximately 15% over the fourth quarter of last year. We shipped 158 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 137 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Total pro forma revenue for the quarter was $677 million, up 13% from prior year. Instrument accessory revenue increased to $326 million, up 16%. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $293 million in the quarter, up 28% from the fourth quarter of last year; and pro forma net income was $224 million, up 22% from Q4 of 2014. 
As we look to the future, we passionately believe that robotic-assisted surgery is in its infancy in application and technology. As we have improved our costs and supply chains for new products, we anticipate increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. These include product investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics. We will also continue to invest in procedure, product and program analytics, international market development and economic and clinical validation. 
Looking to 2016, our priorities are as follows. First, we'll focus on the expanded use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair. Second, we'll work to advance our ecosystem, expand -- including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product line into initial clinical use. Third, we'll drive our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, we'll continue to assist our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."
30239,319152206,920154,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary.

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our prior year Xi-traded programs, legal settlements and legal claim accruals, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased IP and investor impairments. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Pro forma fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, an increase of 13% compared with $601 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and an increase of 15% compared with last quarter. Pro forma revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 excludes $4 million of revenue associated with offers made in 2014 to trade out Si products or Xi product. All trade-out offers were either fulfilled or lapsed in 2014. 
Fourth quarter 2015 procedures of approximately 177,000 increased 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Procedure growth was primarily driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S., and urology worldwide. 
Revenue highlights are as follows. Pro forma instrument and accessory revenue increased 16% compared with last year and increased 9% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The increase relative to prior year reflects procedure growth and increased sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The increase over the prior quarter reflects procedure growth and sales of advanced instruments, partially offset by customer-buying patterns. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,840 per procedure. This metric has now been trending in a tight range between $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure over the past year with recent quarters reflecting higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Pro forma system revenue of $231 million increased 9% compared with last year and increased 32% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased unit sales. The increase relative to the third quarter reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by lower ASPs. 158 systems were placed in the fourth quarter compared with 137 systems in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 117 systems last quarter. Approximately 72% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xis, which is comparable to prior quarter. 
Globally, our average system price of $1,550,000 was comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014 and slightly less than the $1,600,000 ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, increases related to a lower trade-in mix were up -- mostly offset by foreign exchange. The decrease relative to the third quarter reflects geographic mix and a lower proportion of Xi dual consoles. ASPs fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on geographic and product mix, trade-in volume and changes in foreign exchange rates. Hospitals financed approximately 17% of the systems placed in the fourth quarter, down from 25% last quarter. We directly financed 20 systems, including placing the most operating leases, 16, since we began our direct leasing program in the second quarter of 2014. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 49 of the 3,597 systems out in the field were under operating leases. We exclude the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. 
Service revenue of $120 million increased 9% year-over-year and increased 2% compared with the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect the increase in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of U.S. results were as follows. Fourth quarter pro forma revenue outside of the U.S. of $219 million increased 11% compared with $198 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 45% compared with $151 million last quarter. The increase compared with the previous year reflects higher system unit sales and higher recurring revenue driven by procedure growth of 27%. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 75 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 66 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 37 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales include 13 into China, 11 into Japan, 8 into Italy and 7 into Brazil. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation. 
The pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 69.6% compared with 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, the higher gross margin reflects lower inventory charges, improved efficiencies, partially offset by foreign exchange and a higher mix of our newer products, which carry lower gross margins than our mature products. Gross margin includes the impact of the medical device tax, which has been suspended for the next 2 years. The medical device tax reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, on whether we are required to pay the medical device tax and costs associated with manufacturing efficiencies and product charges. 
In 2014, we recorded pretax charges of approximately $82 million, representing the estimated cost of settling a number of product and legal liability claims under a tolling agreement. During 2015, we refined our estimate of the overall cost of settling claims and recorded additional charges of approximately $14 million in the first half of the year. There were no charges in the second half of 2015. Charges made related to this agreement are excluded from our pro forma results and are included in our GAAP results. As of the end of the fourth quarter, $24 million remained accrued on our balance sheet as a significant portion of the estimated costs have been paid. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude reserves for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 6% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase of pro forma operating expenses primarily reflects headcount additions and higher incentive compensation. The increase relative to the third quarter primarily reflects increased incentive compensation. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 18.4% last quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 included tax benefits of $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a recent favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. In late December, Congress renewed the federal research and development credit, resulting in a benefit of $6 million or $0.17 per share. Congress also made the R&D tax credit permanent, so our 2016 rate guidance will reflect this benefit. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. 
Our fourth quarter 2015 pro forma net income was $224 million or $5.89 per share compared with $184 million or $4.92 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $605 million for the fourth quarter 2014 and $590 million for the third quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $147 million or $3.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015. 
We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.3 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by stock buybacks. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 167,000 shares for $84 million at an average price of $505 per share. This brings our total stock repurchases for 2015 to approximately $184 million. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

For the fourth quarter, year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12%, international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14%, with U.S",868,"Thanks, Marshall. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year procedures grew approximately 15%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 12%, international procedures growing approximately 27%. Full year 2015 procedure growth was approximately 14%, with U.S. procedures growing approximately 11% and international procedures growing approximately 26%. 
In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth of approximately 12% was driven by continued strength in general surgery procedures with solid contribution coming from mature procedures despite already high levels of market penetration. We do not expect the strong 2015 growth in established U.S. urology and gynecology procedures to continue in 2016. In U.S. urology, fourth quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney cancer procedures continued at similar rates as earlier in the year. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes has been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 2015 procedure growth in U.S. urology was approximately 12%, led by an approximate 11% growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy. We expect U.S. da Vinci Prostatectomy procedure volumes to return to a level more in line with prostate cancer incidence rates moving forward. 
In U.S. gynecology, fourth quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth in malignant and complex hysterectomy, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. During 2015, a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists compared to 2014. For the year, growth in U.S. gynecology procedures was approximately 1%. In 2016, sustaining growth in U.S. gynecology may be a challenge as we believe the total market for benign hysterectomies will continue to decline at a low single-digit rate. 
Fourth quarter growth in U.S. general surgery remains strong, with robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures being partially offset by continued declines in cholecystectomies. U.S. general surgery procedure growth was approximately 31% for the year with broad-based growth across several procedures, led by hernia repair, which generated the largest number of new general surgery procedures. Growth in colorectal resections was also strong during 2015.  In 2016, there remains a large opportunity in hernia repair and colorectal resections, and driving adoption in these markets remains among our top priorities. 
During the quarter, a group of general surgeons led by Dr. Vorst from St. Joseph Mercy Health System and Dr. Carbonell from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine published their perspective on advances in ventral and incisional hernia repair in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery. Within the paper, data comparing the robotic to open Rives-Stoppa technique for more complex hernias favored the robotic approach with the reduction of blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, fewer surgical site infections and no difference in operative times or direct costs. The paper states that robotic approach ""permits relatively easy access to the anterior abdominal wall, allowing the surgeon to perform the ideal repair for that patient. It also might allow for standardization of surgical technique in order to develop a reliable approach to hernia repair that can be offered to an increasing number of patients."" 
Regarding our U.S. Single-Site business, cholecystectomy volumes continued to decline during the fourth quarter though mostly offset by growth in multiport cholecystectomies. In addition, our Single-Site gynecology procedure volumes declined in the fourth quarter. Taken together, Single-Site procedures represented less than 5% of our fourth quarter U.S. procedure volume. 
Looking abroad during the fourth quarter, the approximate 27% international procedure growth was led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, malignant hysterectomies and colorectal resections. For the full year, procedure growth was approximately 26%. Procedure growth in Europe remained steady throughout 2015. In Asia, procedure growth was led by broad-based adoption in China and South Korea and da Vinci Prostatectomy adoption in Japan. 
During 2016, we expect several external factors to impact international procedure growth. In Japan, the Surgical Society have submitted for reimbursement of partial nephrectomies to the MHLW. Pending the MHLW's decision, this may serve as a tailwind to Japanese procedure growth. In China, we've placed 32 of the 38 da Vinci systems under the current authorization. And sustaining strong procedure growth throughout 2016 may require additional authorizations from the government. 
During the quarter, the global evidence for the cost effectiveness for the use of da Vinci surgery in gynecologic oncology continued to build. A new study from Copenhagen University Hospital by Dr. Hurley [ph] and colleagues modeled the clinical and economic impact of the adoption of da Vinci for malignant hysterectomies, capturing the comprehensive cost of care associated with these interventions. The study compared 158 open hysterectomies to 202 da Vinci hysterectomies and found the da Vinci hysterectomies were 17% less expensive than open hysterectomies based on operating costs and 7% less expensive than open hysterectomies when the da Vinci system cost was included. The study found that cost savings associated with fewer complications and shorter hospitalization more than offset the incremental costs associated with the use of da Vinci technology in the operating room. 
2015 was a robust year for clinical publications featuring da Vinci surgery with over 1,600 papers published during the year, bringing total clinical publications to over 10,000.

As described in our announcement last week, 2015 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 14% to roughly 652,000 procedures performed worldwide. Dur",342,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement last week, 2015 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 14% to roughly 652,000 procedures performed worldwide. During 2016, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 9% to 12%. We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2016 as we've experienced in previous years, with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. 
With respect to revenue, we expect 2016 capital sales to follow historical seasonal patterns, which we anticipate will become more pronounced, with Q1 being sequentially lower than the recently completed Q4. System placements will likely continue to be lumpy, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. as some of these markets are in early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Turning to gross profit. We expect our 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product and regional mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. As Gary mentioned, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. We expect to grow 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $20 million and $25 million in 2016. 
With regard to income tax, we expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits. This forecast does reflect the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in 2016. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

Maybe on the strategic side, I was hoping, Gary, you could go into your thoughts as it relates to the competitive landscape. In robotics, we've heard over the past several months announcements from a couple of emerging competitors, and there's an expected announcement from another competitor later in 2016. Can you maybe talk about how you envision the competitive landscape unfolding and some of the activities you may be undertaking to prepare Intuitive for moving from a monopoly-type market to one that has multiple players?"

As we look at it, value and competition, at the end of the day, value is going to be driven by the ability of these products and services to drive great outcomes and compared or weighed against the price of those things. We think about it as an ecosystem. We think the ecosystem is really important. So it's easy to think just about the robotic system because that's the most visible part, but there's the system, the instruments and accessories, advanced instrumentation like stapling, imaging systems, fluorescence imaging, training technologies like simulators and dual console, clinical validation, training courses offered by academic surgeons that number in the dozens, that whole set of products and ecosystem we think is important. And so as competitors enter, they have to choose. Can they show that value in terms of outcomes and price? And can they offer the set of ecosystem elements that are going to be useful? We've known for years, and have anticipated for years, we didn't wake up yesterday and think, ""Competitors are coming. We better do something."" And so we've been thoughtful about what we need to do to create value for our customers. We have a range of products in the system side that hits different price points for different feature content. We have different options that are available in terms of instrumentation price points, and so we think we're really well positioned. There are some other companies out there. They'll be capable. We expect that customers will explore what they're offering. We think we're well positioned when that exploration occurs."

I'll take you through some of the gross profit commentary and let Gary take you through some of the investments on the OpEx side. Like Gary said on the call, we're focused on reducing our cost of the new products and we've been managing our fixed costs very carefully. We're pleased with the progress we've been making throughout 2015. Our second half 2015 gross profit benefited from favorable product mix, essentially 0 product charges and other favorable outcomes. In 2016, we do expect to deliver continued cost reductions on the newer products, including the Xi stapler, Vessel Sealer and Xi endoscopes. At the same time, as compared with the second half of 2015, we'd expect a higher proportion of 2016 sales to be of the newer products. We'd expect a lower proportion of dual console system sales, probably a higher proportion of system sales involving trade-ins and probably some product charges, at some point, maybe more aligned with historical norms from the past. And while FX is not likely to be as strong a headwind as it was in 2015, it does appear as though it will have some negative impact on revenue and margins. And then lastly, I'd say that from a competitive side, any pressure there, the impacts that are unknown at this stage."

Yes, in terms of the balance of investment, it really is targeted in a couple of areas. R&D is clearly one area that will get investment and then support for international markets and some of those things are more structural, not necessarily just sales folks but clinical trials and other things. So that's where the balance or the bulk of that increase is going to lay in. And we think we have technologies that are important, and we think we have process that we can bring that's important and that will serve us well in the long term in the future. With regard to Sp vis-à-vis Single-Site, we think that Sp really enters and adds value in a different place than Single-Site does. Single-Site tended to work on a little bit more limited workspace, a little bit more constrained set of procedures. Sp is both broader and more capable. Price points are a little bit different. So when you think about Sp, when we think transoral, transanal, colorectal, places where there's specimen removal. So we look at those things, and we think about it.

But I look at the imaging platform that we brought out with Xi and it's a fundamentally different technology basis. Distal chip imaging, it gives us room to do some things from a usability, reach and workflow point of view that were very hard to do otherwise, and so we continue down that pathway. So for example, in Xi, you can move a scope arm to arm. There's not a dedicated robot to hold one endoscope. So that gives you the idea of port hopping, the ability to look around the abdomen differently. The other thing that distal chip imaging gets you is the ability to articulate your endoscope, which is a part of the Sp product line, is endoscopic articulation. We continue to invest in that set of technologies and expand our leadership position there because I think that both -- you can get better image quality and more flexibility and better price points by doing that technology. So that's one set of investments. The other set is as you've mentioned with Firefly, the ability to look and see things that you can't see easily with a white light, so the ability to look and see beneath tissue or to highlight tissue structure. And there are a set of technologies there that are useful and we're investing in, but those are longer term.

Having said that, I think that as you just stand back and look out over the next decade and ask do we think that robotic-assisted surgery can impact more procedures and more types of procedures than are -- they are being impacted today, I think the answer to that is absolutely yes. Some things are things like Sp, products that look different, Sp won't be the last set of products that look different. We think there are opportunities for other products and technologies that can really make a difference in surgeons delivering great care. And so we're excited about it and we're investing in it.

Our first quarter company performance was strong with excellent global procedure growth, solid capital placements, improving product margins and important new product launches. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 17%, led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States, continued growth in U.S. urology and modest growth in U.S. gynecology. Trends in U.S. general surgery growth continued with strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair, followed by continued growth in colorectal surgery. Customer feedback and commitment to the use of da Vinci in performing inguinal hernia repair for complex conditions has been encouraging in the quarter, increasing our confidence in its long-term acceptance. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe with solid performance in the United Kingdom and Germany offsetting slower growth in the Nordic countries. Performance in the quarter was helped by an extra procedure day in some regions relative to Q1 of 2015. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 110 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 99 in Q1 of 2015. Customers continue to purchase our Xi systems over less expensive and less capable Si models by a factor of approximately 3:1. Capital performance was strong in the United States, offsetting capital softness in Europe and the exploration of our quota in China. Lastly, customer leasing and lease-to-own arrangements are making up a greater percentage of new system placements. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call. 
Our operations teams remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains for our newer products. Our teams continue to execute against their goals with steady improvements in reducing product cost for our new systems advanced instruments in the quarter. Product cost reductions exceeded our expectations, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017. 
Our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to meet our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. These ecosystems include systems instruments and accessories, training technologies and coursework, service offerings and program optimization and analytics support. As a result of the set of products and services that surround our systems, recurring revenue in the quarter comprised 75% of total company revenue. 
Highlights of the first quarter operating results are as follows: Procedures grew nearly 17% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 99 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $595 million, up 12% over the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 70% compared to 65.6% in the first quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $322 million, up 16%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $447 million, representing 75% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $229 -- $229 million in the quarter, up 24% from the first quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $170 million, up 27% from Q1 of 2015. 
We continue to enable our Xi platform with new product launches. Our launch of intraoperative table motion is proceeding well, with order flows that has met our expectations and with strong customer feedback on its utility, particularly in general surgery. In the quarter, we also launched our 30-millimeter excise stapler designed to facilitate stapling in thoracic procedures and our Xi Single-Site instrument and accessory kit. Both our 30-millimeter stapler and our Xi Single-Site instruments have started clinical use with positive feedback on their utility. Our Sp program remains on track. 
As our business is strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand our access to our technologies globally. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use. Third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia. And finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."

I will be describing a results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We've posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
First quarter revenue was $595 million, an increase of 12% compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 12% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $677 million. First quarter 2016 procedures of approximately 176,000 increased nearly 17% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter procedures of approximately 177,000. Year-over-year procedure growth was driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S. and urology worldwide and otherwise likely benefit from an additional calendar day associated with leap year. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: instrument and accessory revenue of $322 million increased 16% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. These changes generally reflect changes in procedures. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure. This metric continues to fluctuate in a tight range of approximately 100 -- $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the current quarter reflects higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of customer buying patterns and foreign exchange. System revenue of $148 million increased 5% compared with last year and decreased 36% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased revenue associated with operating lease activities and slightly higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonally lower unit sales and slightly lower ASP, partially offset by increased revenue associated with operating lease activities. 
110 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 99 systems in the first quarter of 2015 and 158 systems last quarter. Approximately 77% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xis, which is comparable to prior quarters.  Hospitals financed approximately 37% of the systems placed in the first quarter, up from 17% less quarter. We directly financed 31 systems, including 19 operating leases. As of the end of the first quarter, there were 62 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter. We also generated approximately $6 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $2 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and no lease buyout revenue in the first quarter of last year. We exclude the impact of operating leases from our system Sp calculations. 
Globally, our average system price of $1,500,000 was approximately $30,000 higher than the first quarter of 2015 ASP and approximately $50,000 lower than the ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, the increase reflects a proportionately lower trade-in volume and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter reflects proportionately higher trade-in volume and lower mix of Xi dual consoles, partially offset by a favorable geographic mix. 
Service revenue of $125 million increased 9% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: first quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $164 million increased 9% compared with $150 million for the first quarter of 2015 and decreased 25% compared with seasonally stronger fourth quarter, up to $219 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 14% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 22% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter reflects seasonally strong fourth quarter systems placements, partially offset by a 5% growth in recurring revenue. Outside the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2015 and 75 last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 5 into China and 8 into Japan. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in their early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 70% compared with 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015 and 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared with the first quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduction of product and product repair cost, improved manufacturing operations efficiencies, the elimination of the medical device tax, lower costs associated with product field actions and related inventory charges and a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue. The medical device tax has been suspended for the next 2 years and reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, our ability to further reduce product costs, manufacturing efficiency, cost associated with product field actions, and in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude legal settlements and accruals for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP increased 14% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increases over prior periods reflect increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics, increased headcount and higher payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.9% for the first quarter of 2015 and 24.9% last quarter. In late December 2015, Congress retroactively approved the 2015 Federal Research and Development Credit and made the R&D tax credit permanent going forward. The entire 2015 R&D tax credit was included in the fourth quarter. While no benefit was reflected in the first quarter of 2015 and a proportional benefit is reflected in the first quarter of 2016, other than the impact of the R&D credit, fluctuations in our tax rate between this quarter and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 primarily reflect changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. Our first quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.42 per share compared with $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter 2015 and $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Note that fully diluted shares outstanding increased by approximately 400,000 shares relative to the fourth quarter, resulting primarily from the increase in our share price. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $595 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase primarily -- was primarily driven by proceeds from stock option exercises and cash generated from operations. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

U.S. procedures grew approximately 15% and OUS procedures grew approximately 22%. In the U.S., even though growth benefited from favorable operating days in the quarter, procedure growth outpaced our expectations. First quarter growth in our mature procedures continued at levels similar to the second half of 2015, generating majority of the procedure outperformance relative to our expectation. General surgery procedure growth also exceeded our expectations. In U.S. urology, first quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures continued in similar rates at the second half of 2015. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer incidence rates over time. 
In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by malignant and complex hysterectomy. Continuing the trend from 2015, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic-oncologists during the first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedure growth declined compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter growth in U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by a robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Cholecystectomy procedures were roughly flat in the quarter with growth in multiform procedures offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures. 
Q1 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I have selected a couple of studies that you may find interesting. With the launch of our 30-millimeter stapler, surgeon interest in the use of da Vinci for thoracic surgery is growing. A new study comparing open video-assisted thoracic surgery or VATS and da Vinci surgery for [indiscernible] was published by Dr. Yang and colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Anals of Surgery. [indiscernible] perspective database, including 2,400 surgeries to treat stage I non-small cell lung cancer patient, [indiscernible] match 470 patients across da Vinci, VATS and open surgery, the study found that da Vinci and minimally invasive VATS approach has enabled a shorter chest tube duration and length of hospital stay compared to open surgery. da Vinci surgery results are also credited with improved lymph node yields as compared to both open surgery and VATS, an important clinical outcome for determining next steps in the patient's treatment pathway. 
As it related to expansion of da Vinci lung resections, the authors highlighted that nearly 57% of pulmonary lobectomies in the U.S. are treated with open surgery, and they see promise in expanding patient access to minimally invasive surgery through da Vinci technology. 
Turning abroad. Procedures growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resection. Compared to the second half of 2015, procedure growth slowed in both Europe and Asia during the quarter, in part due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Historically, our OUS procedure growth rates have been lumpy and less predictable in the short term. We're focused on improving our OUS procedure performance. In Japan, there were positive developments relating to reimbursement in the quarter. The MHLW approved for reimbursement of partial nephrectomy at a premium rate relative to open surgery and also approved clinical trial enrollment to begin supporting [indiscernible] exhibition for da Vinci malignant hysterectomy. 
A recent study funded by Intuitive and published in BJU International by Professor Hughes and colleagues from the University of Chester collected data from the United Kingdom, help statistics database including more than 20,000 prostatectomy patients and 2,000 partial nephrectomy patients to assess health resource utilization and cost following da Vinci, open and laparoscopic procedures. The database showed that from 2008 to 2013, the use of da Vinci surgery increased from 15% to 50% of prostatectomies and 1% to 22% of partial nephrectomies by displacing open surgery. During the first year after the operation, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce inpatient admissions, hospital bed days and total costs for both prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy compared to open surgery. At 3 years post operation, the study showed similar outcomes from prostatectomy and was insufficient to draw conclusions for partial nephrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery outcomes were at the approximate midpoint between da Vinci and open surgery on resource utilization and costs for both procedures. The authors concluded, ""Our analysis suggest that there are substantial savings associated with robotic-assisted surgery when compared with open and laparoscopic interventions."" 
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now based upon favorable U.S. dVP and gynecology macro trends and U.S. general surgery growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. As we have described, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. On our last call, we forecast to grow pro forma 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We are now increasing our estimate for operating expenses to a range of between 12% and 15% above 2015. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect our 2016 other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to be in the upper end of the $20 million to $25 million range forecasts on our last call. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits.

I think that it -- each one of these steps, the 30-millimeter Xi stapler, the Integrated Table Motion, now the Xi instrument kit is rounding out that Xi platform. And we have some more to do. It's not all complete, but it's definitely becoming a much fuller and richer ecosystem. We think that helps. It's very hard to forecast how much it is, how many people sit and wait until the next step. But we think those things at clinical value, for sure. 30-millimeter stapler in thoracic procedures is a big win. Likewise, table motion for a lot of the more complex procedures. So we think that's growing, and there are a group of hospitals that use Si with Single-Site that if there are a single-system hospital, they own only just one and they have a robust Single-Site program, this allows them to consider Xi as an upgrade. It's hard to quantify, but we think, directionally, it's really strong."

On the capital side, I think there's 2 things going on. A little bit of environment is one. And a little bit of a wait and see on competitive offerings as they come out.

The things that have gotten really stronger and interesting in the last couple of years have been our ability to analyze data, look at national benchmarking, look at regional base benchmarking and share that information with a customers so that they can make good decisions. Sometimes those decisions are good for them and not great for Intuitive in the near term.

As we look at urology, you've got like 3 main procedures in urology: prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy and cystectomy. The biggest one being prostatectomy. We know that there was a bolus of patients that went into watchful waiting, some of whom will have disease progression and come back for definitive treatment. How long that bolus lasts is a little bit hard for us to predict. The second thing are the possibility of share changes between some of the treatment modalities, surgery versus radiation, versus watchful waiting. That data tends to lag. Hard to get it in real time. There may be some share change, although there is it's probably modest. And then there's just demographics. It's demographics changes you have more folks getting diagnosed with prostate cancer over time. So those are the 3 things rolling through and sort of projecting how they balance out is what the challenge is. On the gynecology side, the thing that were's seeing in our experience is that you're seeing more surgery being done by high-volume gynecologists, in general, just not robotic surgery but laparoscopy and others. We're seeing consolidation in the marketplace into folks who are either oncologists or more routine surgeons. We think that's good for the world, and we think that's good for Intuitive. Those more dedicated surgeons tend to be our customers. We see them tackling more procedures in concentrated fashions, and so that's kind of what's happening in gynecology.

That was our last question.

Turning firs",768,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first quarter company performance was strong with excellent global procedure growth, solid capital placements, improving product margins and important new product launches. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 17% led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States, continued growth in U.S. urology and modest growth in U.S. gynecology. Trends in U.S. general surgery growth continued with strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair, followed by continued growth in colorectal surgery. Customer feedback and commitment to the use of da Vinci in performing inguinal hernia repair for complex conditions has been encouraging in the quarter, increasing our confidence in its long-term acceptance. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with solid performance in the United Kingdom and Germany offsetting slower growth in the Nordic countries. Performance in the quarter was helped by an extra procedure day in some regions relative to Q1 of 2015. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 110 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 99 in Q1 of 2015. Customers continue to purchase our Xi Systems over less expensive and less capable Si models by a factor of approximately 3:1. Capital performance was strong in the United States, offsetting capital softness in Europe and the exploration of our quota in China. Lastly, customer leasing and lease-to-own arrangements are making up a greater percentage of new system placements. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call. 
Our operations teams remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains for our newer products. Our teams continue to execute against their goals with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems and advanced instruments in the quarter. Product cost reductions exceeded our expectations, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017. 
Our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to meet our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. These ecosystems include systems instruments and accessories, training technologies and peer-to-peer coursework, service offerings and program optimization and analytics support. As a result of the set of products and services that surround our systems, recurring revenue in the quarter comprised 75% of total company revenue. 
Highlights of the first quarter operating results are as follows: Procedures grew nearly 17% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 99 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $595 million, up 12% over the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 70% compared to 65.6% in the first quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $322 million, up 16%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $447 million, representing 75% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $229 million in the quarter, up 24% from the first quarter of last year; and pro forma net income was $170 million, up 27% from Q1 of 2015. 
We continue to enable our Xi platform with new product launches. Our launch of intraoperative Table Motion is proceeding well, with order flow that has met our expectations and with strong customer feedback on its utility, particularly in general surgery. In the quarter, we also launched our 30-millimeter Xi stapler designed to facilitate stapling in thoracic procedures and our Xi Single-Site instrument and accessory kit. Both our 30-millimeter stapler and our Xi Single-Site instruments have started clinical use with positive feedback on their utility. Our Sp program remains on track. 
As our business is strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand our access to our technologies globally. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."

We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
First quarter revenue was $595 million, an increase of 12% compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 12% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $677 million. First quarter 2016 procedures of approximately 176,000 increased nearly 17% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter procedures of approximately 177,000. Year-over-year procedure growth was driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S. and urology worldwide. It otherwise likely benefited from an additional calendar day associated with leap year. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue of $322 million increased 16% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. These changes generally reflect changes in procedures. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure. This metric continues to fluctuate in a tight range of approximately 100 -- $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the current quarter reflects higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of customer buying patterns and foreign exchange. System revenue of $148 million increased 5% compared with last year and decreased 36% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased revenue associated with operating lease activities and slightly higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonally lower unit sales and slightly lower ASPs, partially offset by increased revenue associated with operating lease activities. 110 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 99 systems in the first quarter of 2015 and 158 systems last quarter. Approximately 77% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xis, which is comparable to prior quarters. Hospitals financed approximately 37% of the systems placed in the first quarter, up from 17% less quarter. We directly financed 31 systems, including 19 operating leases. As of the end of the first quarter, there were 62 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter. We also generated approximately $6 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $2 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and no lease buyout revenue in the first quarter of last year. We excluded the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price of $1,500,000 was approximately $30,000 higher than the first quarter of 2015 ASP and approximately $50,000 lower than the ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, the increase reflects a proportionately lower trade-in volume and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter reflects proportionately higher trade-in volume and lower mix of Xi dual consoles, partially offset by a favorable geographic mix. 
Service revenue of $125 million increased 9% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $164 million increased 9% compared with $150 million for the first quarter of 2015 and decreased 25% compared with seasonally stronger fourth quarter, up to $219 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 14% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 22% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter reflects seasonally strong fourth quarter systems placements, partially offset by a 5% growth in recurring revenue. Outside the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2015 and 75 last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 5 into China and 8 into Japan. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in their early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns; and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 70% compared with 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015 and 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared with the first quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduction of product and product repair costs, improved manufacturing operations efficiencies, the elimination of the medical device tax, lower costs associated with product field actions and related inventory charges and a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue. The medical device tax has been suspended for the next 2 years and reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, our ability to further reduce product costs, manufacturing efficiency, costs associated with product field actions and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude legal settlements and accruals for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 14% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increases over prior periods reflect increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics; increased headcount and higher payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.9% for the first quarter of 2015 and 24.9% last quarter. In late December 2015, Congress retroactively approved the 2015 federal research and development credit and made the R&D tax credit permanent going forward. The entire 2015 R&D tax credit was included in the fourth quarter. While no benefit was reflected in the first quarter of 2015 and a proportional benefit is reflected in the first quarter of 2016, other than the impact of the R&D credit, fluctuations in our tax rate between this quarter and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 primarily reflect changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. 
Our first quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.42 per share compared with $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Note that fully diluted shares outstanding increased by approximately 400,000 shares relative to the fourth quarter, resulting primarily from the increase in our share price. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $595 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase primarily -- was primarily driven by proceeds from stock option exercises and cash generated from operations. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 17%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 15% and OUS procedures grew approximately 22%. In the U.S., even though growth benefited from favorable operating days in the quarter, procedure grow",782,"Thanks, Marshall. Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 17%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 15% and OUS procedures grew approximately 22%. In the U.S., even though growth benefited from favorable operating days in the quarter, procedure growth outpaced our expectations. First quarter growth in our mature procedures continued at levels similar to the second half of 2015, generating majority of the procedure outperformance relative to our expectation. General surgery procedure growth also exceeded our expectations. In U.S. urology, first quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures continued in similar rates as the second half of 2015. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect the prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer incidence rates over time. 
In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year with growth led by malignant and complex hysterectomy. Continuing the trend from 2015, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic-oncologists during the first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedure growth declined compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter growth in U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by a robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Cholecystectomy procedures were roughly flat in the quarter with growth in multiport procedures offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures. 
Q1 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I had selected a couple of studies that you may find interesting. With the launch of our 30-millimeter stapler, surgeon interest in the use of da Vinci for thoracic surgery is growing. A new study comparing open video-assisted thoracic surgery or VATS and da Vinci surgery for pulmonary lobectomy was published by Dr. Yang [ph] and colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Annals of Surgery. Using a prospective database including 2,400 surgeries to treat stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients, the officers propensity matched 470 patients across da Vinci, VATS and open surgery. The study found that da Vinci and minimally invasive VATS approaches enabled a shorter chest tube duration and length of hospital stay compared to open surgery. da Vinci surgery was also credited with improved lymph node yields as compared to both open surgery and VATS, an important clinical outcome for determining next steps in the patient's treatment pathway. 
As it related to the expansion of da Vinci lung resections, the authors highlighted that nearly 57% of pulmonary lobectomies in the U.S. are treated with open surgery, and they see promise in expanding patient access to minimally invasive surgery through da Vinci technology. 
Turning abroad. Procedures growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the second half of 2015, procedure growth slowed in both Europe and Asia during the quarter, in part due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Historically, our OUS procedure growth rates have been lumpy and less predictable in the short term. We are focused on improving our OUS procedure performance. 
In Japan, there were positive developments relating to reimbursement in the quarter. The MHLW approved for reimbursement of partial nephrectomy at a premium rate relative to open surgery and also approved clinical trial enrollment to begin supporting a Senshin Iryo B submission for da Vinci malignant hysterectomy. 
A recent study funded by Intuitive and published in BJU International by Professor Hughes and colleagues from University of Chester collected data from the United Kingdom Health Episode Statistics database, including more than 20,000 prostatectomy patients and 2,000 partial nephrectomy patients to assess health resource utilization and costs following da Vinci, open and laparoscopic procedures. The database showed that from 2008 to 2013, the use of da Vinci surgery increased from 15% to 50% of prostatectomies and 1% to 22% of partial nephrectomies by displacing open surgery. During the first year after the operation, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce inpatient admissions, hospital bed days and total costs for both prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy compared to open surgery. At 3 years post operation, the study showed similar outcomes for prostatectomy and was insufficient to draw conclusions for partial nephrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery outcomes were at the approximate midpoint between da Vinci and open surgery on resource utilization and costs for both procedures. The authors concluded, ""Our analysis suggests that there are substantial savings associated with robotic-assisted surgery when compared with open and laparoscopic interventions."" 
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now based upon favorable U.S. dVP and gynecology macro trends and U.S. general surgery growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. As we have described, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. On our last call, we forecast to grow pro forma 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We are now increasing our estimate for operating expenses to a range of between 12% and 15% above 2015. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect our 2016 other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to be in the upper end of the $20 million to $25 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

From a tailwinds, you had leap year that benefited the quarter and some modest benefit from the timing of the year as being on a Friday rather than a Thursday. And from a headwind perspective, you had the timing of Easter, which moved from the second quarter into the first quarter, but that has more of an impact on the OUS geographies. From what accelerated, the mature procedures sustained pretty strong growth in the quarter as they saw throughout 2015, which is a little bit of a surprise to us relative to our initial expectation.

Those validations are all multiyear efforts to get right to the full instrument kit from vessel sealing and stapling and so on. And so we're pretty thoughtful about balancing that sort of investments. The things that have gotten really stronger and interesting in the last couple of years have been our ability to analyze data, look at national benchmarking, look at regional base benchmarking and share that information with our customers so that they can make good decisions. Sometimes those decisions are good for them and not great for Intuitive in the near term. If they optimize their program, we may get [indiscernible] revenue per procedure in the near term, but we think long term, it's better for everybody. And so we've been making those analytics and those investments and then communicating with hospitals. So we really have been plugging in each of those settings, and I do think it makes for an ecosystem that creates a lot of value for the customer and builds our relationship with them."

As we look at urology, you've got like 3 main procedures in urology: prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy and cystectomy, the biggest one being prostatectomy. We know that there was a bolus of patients that went into watchful waiting, some of whom will have disease progression and come back to definitive treatment. How long that bolus lasts is a little bit hard for us to predict. The second thing are the possibility of share changes between some of the treatment modalities, surgery versus radiation versus watchful waiting. That data tends to lag. Hard to get it in real time. There may be some share change, although if there is, it's probably modest. And then there's just demographics. As demographics changes, you have more folks getting diagnosed with prostate cancer over time. So those are the 3 things that are rolling through and sort of projecting how they balance out is what the challenge is. On the gynecology side, the thing that were's seeing in our experience is that you're seeing more surgery being done by high-volume gynecologists, in general, just -- not just robotic surgery but laparoscopy and others. We're seeing a consolidation in the marketplace into folks who are either GYN-oncologists or more routine surgeons. We think that's good for the world, and we think that's good for Intuitive. Those more dedicated surgeons tend to be our customers. We see them tackling more procedures in concentrated fashions, and so that's kind of what's happened in gynecology. Likewise, I think there's a demographic element here that's likely to find the bottom and then start to drift up. The unknown is nonsurgical approaches and in-office approaches. And those are kind of the factors at play. Patrick, I'll let you go from there."

I don't think there's a systemic worry here that, that somehow we're stuck at prostatectomy and won't be able to move any further. I do think that it's important for folks on the phone to realize that the profile of procedures in each country is going to differ based on disease state based on how the reimbursement system works and the relative priorities of their health care system, so we see that reflected. We do see multiple procedure adoption in different countries. It just differs on what they're after. 
That was our last question.

Turning firs",769,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first quarter company performance was strong with excellent global procedure growth, solid capital placements, improving product margins and important new product launches. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 17% led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States, continued growth in U.S. urology and modest growth in U.S. gynecology. Trends in U.S. general surgery growth continued with strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair, followed by continued growth in colorectal surgery. Customer feedback and commitment to the use of da Vinci in performing inguinal hernia repair for complex conditions has been encouraging in the quarter, increasing our confidence in its long-term acceptance. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with solid performance in the United Kingdom and Germany offsetting slower growth in the Nordic countries. Performance in the quarter was helped by an extra procedure day in some regions relative to Q1 of 2015. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 110 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 99 in Q1 of 2015. Customers continued to purchase our Xi Systems over less expensive and less capable Si models by a factor of approximately 3:1. Capital performance was strong in the United States, offsetting capital softness in Europe and the exploration of our quota in China. Lastly, customer leasing and lease-to-own arrangements are making up a greater percentage of new system placements. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call. 
Our operations teams remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains for our newer products. Our teams continued to execute against their goals with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems and advanced instruments in the quarter. Product cost reductions exceeded our expectations, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017. 
Our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to meet our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. These ecosystems include systems instruments and accessories, training technologies and peer-to-peer coursework, service offerings and program optimization and analytics support. As a result of the set of products and services that surround our systems, recurring revenue in the quarter comprised 75% of total company revenue. 
Highlights of the first quarter operating results are as follows: procedures grew nearly 17% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 99 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $595 million, up 12% over the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 70% compared to 65.6% in the first quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $322 million, up 16%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $447 million, representing 75% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $229 million in the quarter, up 24% from the first quarter of last year; and pro forma net income was $170 million, up 27% from Q1 of 2015. 
We continued to enable our Xi platform with new product launches. Our launch of intraoperative Table Motion is proceeding well, with order flow that has met our expectations and with strong customer feedback on its utility, particularly in general surgery. In the quarter, we also launched our 30-millimeter Xi stapler designed to facilitate stapling in thoracic procedures and our Xi Single-Site instrument and accessory kit. Both our 30-millimeter stapler and our Xi Single-Site instruments have started clinical use with positive feedback on their utility. Our Sp program remains on track. 
As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand our -- access to our technologies globally. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general in thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities end markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
First quarter revenue was $595 million, an increase of 12% compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 12% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $677 million. First quarter 2016 procedures of approximately 176,000 increased nearly 17% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter procedures of approximately 177,000. Year-over-year procedure growth was driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S. and urology worldwide. It otherwise likely benefited from an additional calendar day associated with leap year. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue of $322 million increased 16% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. These changes generally reflect changes in procedures. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure. This metric continues to fluctuate in a tight range of approximately 100 -- $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the current quarter reflects higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of customer buying patterns and foreign exchange. System revenue of $148 million increased 5% compared with last year and decreased 36% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased revenue associated with operating lease activities and slightly higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonally lower unit sales and slightly lower ASPs, partially offset by increased revenue associated with operating lease activities. 110 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 99 systems in the first quarter of 2015 and 158 systems last quarter. Approximately 77% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xis, which is comparable to prior quarters. Hospitals financed approximately 37% of the systems placed in the first quarter, up from 17% less quarter. We directly financed 31 systems, including 19 operating leases. As of the end of the first quarter, there were 62 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter. We also generated approximately $6 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $2 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and no lease buyout revenue in the first quarter of last year. We excluded the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price of $1,500,000 was approximately $30,000 higher than the first quarter of 2015 ASP and approximately $50,000 lower than the ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, the increase reflects a proportionately lower trade-in volume and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter reflects proportionately higher trade-in volume and lower mix of Xi dual consoles, partially offset by a favorable geographic mix. 
Service revenue of $125 million increased 9% year over year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: first quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $164 million increased 9% compared with $150 million for the first quarter of 2015 and decreased 25% compared with seasonally stronger fourth quarter, up to $219 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 14% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by a procedure growth of 22% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter reflects seasonally strong fourth quarter systems placements, partially offset by a 5% growth in recurring revenue. Outside the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2015 and 75 last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 5 into China and 8 into Japan. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in their early stages of adoption; some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns; and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 70% compared with 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015 and 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared with the first quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects a reduction of product and product repair costs, improved manufacturing operations efficiencies, the elimination of the medical device tax, lower costs associated with product field actions and related inventory charges and a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue. The medical device tax has been suspended for the next 2 years and reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, our ability to further reduce product costs, manufacturing efficiency, costs associated with product field actions and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude legal settlements and accruals for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 14% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increases over prior periods reflect increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics; increased headcount and higher payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.9% for the first quarter of 2015 and 24.9% last quarter. In late December 2015, Congress retroactively approved the 2015 federal research and development credit and made the R&D tax credit permanent going forward. The entire 2015 R&D tax credit was included in the fourth quarter, while no benefit was reflected in the first quarter of 2015 and a proportional benefit is reflected in the first quarter of 2016. Other than the impact of the R&D credit, fluctuations in our tax rate between this quarter and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 primarily reflect changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. 
Our first quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.42 per share compared with $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Note that fully diluted shares outstanding increased by approximately 400,000 shares relative to the fourth quarter, resulting primarily from the increase in our share price. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $595 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase primarily -- was primarily driven by proceeds from stock option exercises and cash generated from operations. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 17%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 15% and OUS procedures grew approximately 22%. In the U.S., even though growth benefited from favorable operating days in the quarter, procedure growth outpaced our expectations. First quarter growth in our mature procedures continued at levels similar to the second half of 2015, generating majority of the procedure outperformance relative to our expectation. General surgery procedure growth also exceeded our expectations. In U.S. urology, first quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures continued at similar rates as the second half of 2015. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect the prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer incidence rates over time. 
In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedures grew modestly year over year with growth led by malignant and complex hysterectomy. Continuing the trend from 2015, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic-oncologists during the first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedure growth declined compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter growth in U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by a robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Cholecystectomy procedures were roughly flat in the quarter with growth in multiport procedures offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures. 
Q1 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I selected a couple of studies that you may find interesting. With the launch of our 30-millimeter stapler, surgeon interest in the use of da Vinci for thoracic surgery is growing. A new study comparing open video-assisted thoracic surgery or VATS and da Vinci surgery for pulmonary lobectomy was published by Dr. Yang and colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Annals of Surgery. Using a prospective database including 2,400 surgeries to treat stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients, the officers propensity matched 470 patients across da Vinci, VATS and open surgery. The study found that da Vinci and minimally invasive VATS approaches enabled a shorter chest tube duration and length of hospital stay compared to open surgery. da Vinci surgery was also credited with improved lymph node yields as compared to both open surgery and VATS, an important clinical outcome for determining next steps in the patient's treatment pathway. 
As it related to the expansion of da Vinci lung resections, the authors highlighted that nearly 57% of pulmonary lobectomies in the U.S. are treated with open surgery, and they see promise in expanding patient access to minimally invasive surgery through da Vinci technology. 
Turning abroad. Procedures growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the second half of 2015, procedure growth slowed in both Europe and Asia during the quarter, in part due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Historically, our OUS procedure growth rates have been lumpy and less predictable in the short term. We are focused on improving our OUS procedure performance. 
In Japan, there were positive developments relating to reimbursement in the quarter. The MHLW approved for reimbursement of partial nephrectomy at a premium rate relative to open surgery and also approved clinical trial enrollment to begin supporting a Senshin Iryo B submission for da Vinci malignant hysterectomy. 
A recent study funded by Intuitive and published in BJU International by Professor Hughes and colleagues from the University of Chester collected data from the United Kingdom Health Episode Statistics database, including more than 20,000 prostatectomy patients and 2,000 partial nephrectomy patients to assess health resource utilization and costs following da Vinci, open and laparoscopic procedures. The database showed that from 2008 to 2013, the use of da Vinci surgery increased from 15% to 50% of prostatectomies and 1% to 22% of partial nephrectomies by displacing open surgery. During the first year after the operation, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce inpatient admissions, hospital bed days and total costs for both prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy compared to open surgery. At 3 years post operation, the study showed similar outcomes for prostatectomy and was insufficient to draw conclusions for partial nephrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery outcomes were at the approximate midpoint between da Vinci and open surgery on resource utilization and costs for both procedures. The authors concluded, ""Our analysis suggests that there are substantial savings associated with robotic-assisted surgery when compared with open and laparoscopic interventions.""
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now based upon favorable U.S. dVP and gynecology macro trends and U.S. general surgery growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. As we have described, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. On our last call, we forecast to grow pro forma 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We are now increasing our estimate for operating expenses to a range of between 12% and 15% above 2015. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect our 2016 other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to be in the upper end of the $20 million to $25 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

And from a headwind perspective, you had the timing of Easter, which moved from the second quarter into the first quarter, but that had more of an impact on the OUS geographies. From what accelerated, the mature procedures sustained pretty strong growth in the quarter as they saw throughout 2015, which is a little bit of a surprise to us relative to our initial expectation. And general surgery continues to be strong and growing off of a larger base, which has more impact on the U.S. procedure drum pump."

Advanced imaging, the ability to see beyond what you can just see with your naked eye; new robotic architectures that allow surgeons to get into and out of the body in different ways into different places that they could reach prior as well as analytics and over-the-shoulder guidance, all things that we have been investing in and some things that we're accelerating.

The 30-millimeter stapler in thoracic procedures is a big win; likewise, Table Motion for a lot of the more complex procedures. So we think that's strong and there are a group of hospitals that use Si with Single-Site that if they are a single-system hospital, they own only -- own just one and they have a robust Single-Site program.

Those validations are all multiyear efforts to get right to the full instrument kit from vessel sealing and stapling and so on. And so we're pretty thoughtful about balancing that sort of investments. The things that have gotten really stronger and interesting in the last couple of years have been our ability to analyze data, look at national benchmarking, look at regional base benchmarking and share that information with our customers so that they can make good decisions. Sometimes those decisions are good for them and not great for Intuitive in the near term. If they optimize their program, we may get [indiscernible] revenue per procedure in the near term, but we think long term, it's better for everybody. And so we've been making those analytics and those investments and then communicating with hospitals. So we really have been plugging in each of those settings, and I do think it makes for an ecosystem that creates a lot of value for the customer and builds our relationship with them."

Let me speak to a couple of the factors, and then I'll let Patrick take it from there. As we look at urology, you've got like 3 main procedures in urology: prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy and cystectomy, the biggest one being prostatectomy. We know that there was a bolus of patients that went into watchful waiting, some of whom will have disease progression and come back to definitive treatment. How long that bolus lasts is a little bit hard for us to predict. The second thing are the possibility of share changes between some of the treatment modalities, surgery versus radiation versus watchful waiting. That data tends to lag. Hard to get it in real time. There may be some share change, although if there is, it's probably modest. And then there's just demographics. As demographics changes, you have more folks getting diagnosed with prostate cancer over time. So those are the 3 things that are rolling through and sort of projecting how they balance out is what the challenge is. On the gynecology side, the thing that we're seeing in our experience is that you're seeing more surgery being done by high-volume gynecologists, in general, just -- not just robotic surgery but laparoscopy and others. We're seeing a consolidation in the marketplace into folks who are either GYN-oncologists or more routine surgeons. We think that's good for the world, and we think that's good for Intuitive. Those more dedicated surgeons tend to be our customers. We see them tackling more procedures in concentrated fashions, and so that's kind of what's happened in gynecology. Likewise, I think there's a demographic element here that's likely to find the bottom and then starts to drift up. The unknown is nonsurgical approaches and in-office approaches. And those are kind of the factors at play. Patrick, I'll let you go from there."

So we see, for example, nice adoption of thoracic surgery in China. We see a pretty different mix of procedures in Korea than we see in the United States. So you have to answer it country by country. I don't think there's a systemic worry here that, that somehow we're stuck at prostatectomy and won't be able to move any further. I do think that it's important for folks on the phone to realize that the profile of procedures in each country is going to differ based on disease state based on how the reimbursement system works and the relative priorities of their health care system, so we see that reflected. We do see multiple procedure adoption in different countries. It just differs on what they're after. 
That was our last question. As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flows during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.

Turning firs",769,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first quarter company performance was strong with excellent global procedure growth, solid capital placements, improving product margins and important new product launches. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 17% led by growth in general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States, continued growth in U.S. urology and modest growth in U.S. gynecology. Trends in U.S. general surgery growth continued with strong growth in inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair, followed by continued growth in colorectal surgery. Customer feedback and commitment to the use of da Vinci in performing inguinal hernia repair for complex conditions has been encouraging in the quarter, increasing our confidence in its long-term acceptance. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with solid performance in the United Kingdom and Germany offsetting slower growth in the Nordic countries. Performance in the quarter was helped by an extra procedure day in some regions relative to Q1 of 2015. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 110 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 99 in Q1 of 2015. Customers continued to purchase our Xi Systems over less expensive and less capable Si models by a factor of approximately 3:1. Capital performance was strong in the United States, offsetting capital softness in Europe and the exploration of our quota in China. Lastly, customer leasing and lease-to-own arrangements are making up a greater percentage of new system placements. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call. 
Our operations teams remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains for our newer products. Our teams continued to execute against their goals with steady improvements in reducing product costs for our new systems and advanced instruments in the quarter. Product cost reductions exceeded our expectations, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2016 and 2017. 
Our offerings make up an ecosystem designed to meet our customers' needs in building and running outstanding robotic surgery programs. These ecosystems include systems instruments and accessories, training technologies and peer-to-peer coursework, service offerings and program optimization and analytics support. As a result of the set of products and services that surround our systems, recurring revenue in the quarter comprised 75% of total company revenue. 
Highlights of the first quarter operating results are as follows: procedures grew nearly 17% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 99 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $595 million, up 12% over the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 70% compared to 65.6% in the first quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $322 million, up 16%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $447 million, representing 75% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $229 million in the quarter, up 24% from the first quarter of last year; and pro forma net income was $170 million, up 27% from Q1 of 2015. 
We continued to enable our Xi platform with new product launches. Our launch of intraoperative Table Motion is proceeding well, with order flow that has met our expectations and with strong customer feedback on its utility, particularly in general surgery. In the quarter, we also launched our 30-millimeter Xi stapler designed to facilitate stapling in thoracic procedures and our Xi Single-Site instrument and accessory kit. Both our 30-millimeter stapler and our Xi Single-Site instruments have started clinical use with positive feedback on their utility. Our Sp program remains on track. 
As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand our -- access to our technologies globally. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we're focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general in thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Sp product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities end markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
First quarter revenue was $595 million, an increase of 12% compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 12% compared with the seasonally stronger fourth quarter of $677 million. First quarter 2016 procedures of approximately 176,000 increased nearly 17% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter procedures of approximately 177,000. Year-over-year procedure growth was driven by general surgery procedures in the U.S. and urology worldwide. It otherwise likely benefited from an additional calendar day associated with leap year. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue of $322 million increased 16% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. These changes generally reflect changes in procedures. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,830 per procedure. This metric continues to fluctuate in a tight range of approximately 100 -- $1,830 and $1,840 per procedure. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the current quarter reflects higher sales of advanced instruments, offset by the impact of customer buying patterns and foreign exchange. System revenue of $148 million increased 5% compared with last year and decreased 36% compared with last quarter. The increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased revenue associated with operating lease activities and slightly higher average system selling prices. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter primarily reflects seasonally lower unit sales and slightly lower ASPs, partially offset by increased revenue associated with operating lease activities. 110 systems were placed in the first quarter compared with 99 systems in the first quarter of 2015 and 158 systems last quarter. Approximately 77% of the systems shipped in the quarter were Xis, which is comparable to prior quarters. Hospitals financed approximately 37% of the systems placed in the first quarter, up from 17% less quarter. We directly financed 31 systems, including 19 operating leases. As of the end of the first quarter, there were 62 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $3 million in the fourth quarter. We also generated approximately $6 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $2 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and no lease buyout revenue in the first quarter of last year. We excluded the impact of operating leases from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price of $1,500,000 was approximately $30,000 higher than the first quarter of 2015 ASP and approximately $50,000 lower than the ASP last quarter. Relative to the prior year, the increase reflects a proportionately lower trade-in volume and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter reflects proportionately higher trade-in volume and lower mix of Xi dual consoles, partially offset by a favorable geographic mix. 
Service revenue of $125 million increased 9% year over year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: first quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $164 million increased 9% compared with $150 million for the first quarter of 2015 and decreased 25% compared with seasonally stronger fourth quarter, up to $219 million. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 14% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by a procedure growth of 22% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The decrease compared to the fourth quarter reflects seasonally strong fourth quarter systems placements, partially offset by a 5% growth in recurring revenue. Outside the U.S., we placed 36 systems in the first quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2015 and 75 last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 5 into China and 8 into Japan. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in their early stages of adoption; some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns; and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was 70% compared with 65.6% for the first quarter of 2015 and 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared with the first quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects a reduction of product and product repair costs, improved manufacturing operations efficiencies, the elimination of the medical device tax, lower costs associated with product field actions and related inventory charges and a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue. The medical device tax has been suspended for the next 2 years and reduced our 2015 gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, our ability to further reduce product costs, manufacturing efficiency, costs associated with product field actions and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses, which exclude legal settlements and accruals for legal claims, stock compensation expense and amortization of purchased IP, increased 14% compared with the first quarter of 2015 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increases over prior periods reflect increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics; increased headcount and higher payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.9% for the first quarter of 2015 and 24.9% last quarter. In late December 2015, Congress retroactively approved the 2015 federal research and development credit and made the R&D tax credit permanent going forward. The entire 2015 R&D tax credit was included in the fourth quarter, while no benefit was reflected in the first quarter of 2015 and a proportional benefit is reflected in the first quarter of 2016. Other than the impact of the R&D credit, fluctuations in our tax rate between this quarter and the first and fourth quarters of 2015 primarily reflect changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income. 
Our first quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $170 million or $4.42 per share compared with $135 million or $3.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $224 million or $5.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Note that fully diluted shares outstanding increased by approximately 400,000 shares relative to the fourth quarter, resulting primarily from the increase in our share price. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $595 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $532 million for the first quarter of 2015 and $677 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP net income was $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $97 million or $2.57 per share for the first quarter of 2015 and $190 million or $4.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We ended the year with cash and investments of $3.8 billion, up from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase primarily -- was primarily driven by proceeds from stock option exercises and cash generated from operations. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 17%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 15% and OUS procedures grew approximately 22%. In the U.S., even though growth benefited from favorable operating days in the quarter, procedure growth outpaced our expectations. First quarter growth in our mature procedures continued at levels similar to the second half of 2015, generating majority of the procedure outperformance relative to our expectation. General surgery procedure growth also exceeded our expectations. In U.S. urology, first quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures continued at similar rates as the second half of 2015. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect the prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer incidence rates over time. 
In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedures grew modestly year over year with growth led by malignant and complex hysterectomy. Continuing the trend from 2015, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic-oncologists during the first quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedure growth declined compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter growth in U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by a robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Cholecystectomy procedures were roughly flat in the quarter with growth in multiport procedures offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures. 
Q1 was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I selected a couple of studies that you may find interesting. With the launch of our 30-millimeter stapler, surgeon interest in the use of da Vinci for thoracic surgery is growing. A new study comparing open video-assisted thoracic surgery or VATS and da Vinci surgery for pulmonary lobectomy was published by Dr. Yang and colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Annals of Surgery. Using a prospective database including 2,400 surgeries to treat stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients, the officers propensity matched 470 patients across da Vinci, VATS and open surgery. The study found that da Vinci and minimally invasive VATS approaches enabled a shorter chest tube duration and length of hospital stay compared to open surgery. da Vinci surgery was also credited with improved lymph node yields as compared to both open surgery and VATS, an important clinical outcome for determining next steps in the patient's treatment pathway. 
As it related to the expansion of da Vinci lung resections, the authors highlighted that nearly 57% of pulmonary lobectomies in the U.S. are treated with open surgery, and they see promise in expanding patient access to minimally invasive surgery through da Vinci technology. 
Turning abroad. Procedures growth outside of the United States was approximately 22% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the second half of 2015, procedure growth slowed in both Europe and Asia during the quarter, in part due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Historically, our OUS procedure growth rates have been lumpy and less predictable in the short term. We are focused on improving our OUS procedure performance. 
In Japan, there were positive developments relating to reimbursement in the quarter. The MHLW approved for reimbursement of partial nephrectomy at a premium rate relative to open surgery and also approved clinical trial enrollment to begin supporting a Senshin Iryo B submission for da Vinci malignant hysterectomy. 
A recent study funded by Intuitive and published in BJU International by Professor Hughes and colleagues from the University of Chester collected data from the United Kingdom Health Episode Statistics database, including more than 20,000 prostatectomy patients and 2,000 partial nephrectomy patients to assess health resource utilization and costs following da Vinci, open and laparoscopic procedures. The database showed that from 2008 to 2013, the use of da Vinci surgery increased from 15% to 50% of prostatectomies and 1% to 22% of partial nephrectomies by displacing open surgery. During the first year after the operation, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce inpatient admissions, hospital bed days and total costs for both prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy compared to open surgery. At 3 years post operation, the study showed similar outcomes for prostatectomy and was insufficient to draw conclusions for partial nephrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery outcomes were at the approximate midpoint between da Vinci and open surgery on resource utilization and costs for both procedures. The authors concluded, ""Our analysis suggests that there are substantial savings associated with robotic-assisted surgery when compared with open and laparoscopic interventions.""
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now based upon favorable U.S. dVP and gynecology macro trends and U.S. general surgery growth, we are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 68% and 69.5% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. As we have described, we will be increasing our investments in key areas that will enable and drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery. On our last call, we forecast to grow pro forma 2016 operating expenses between 9% and 13% above 2015 levels. We are now increasing our estimate for operating expenses to a range of between 12% and 15% above 2015. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect our 2016 other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to be in the upper end of the $20 million to $25 million range forecast on our last call. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and OUS profits.

The other side is on R&D. And in terms of the categories, we've talked about it before, but we believe in them deeply. Advanced imaging, the ability to see beyond what you can just see with your naked eye; new robotic architectures that allow surgeons to get into and out of the body in different ways into different places that they could reach prior as well as analytics and over-the-shoulder guidance, all things that we have been investing in and some things that we're accelerating.

The things that have gotten really stronger and interesting in the last couple of years have been our ability to analyze data, look at national benchmarking, look at regional base benchmarking and share that information with our customers so that they can make good decisions. Sometimes those decisions are good for them and not great for Intuitive in the near term. If they optimize their program, we may get [indiscernible] revenue per procedure in the near term, but we think long term, it's better for everybody.

As we look at urology, you've got like 3 main procedures in urology: prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy and cystectomy, the biggest one being prostatectomy. We know that there was a bolus of patients that went into watchful waiting, some of whom will have disease progression and come back to definitive treatment. How long that bolus lasts is a little bit hard for us to predict. The second thing are the possibility of share changes between some of the treatment modalities, surgery versus radiation versus watchful waiting. That data tends to lag. Hard to get it in real time. There may be some share change, although if there is, it's probably modest. And then there's just demographics. As demographics changes, you have more folks getting diagnosed with prostate cancer over time. So those are the 3 things that are rolling through and sort of projecting how they balance out is what the challenge is. On the gynecology side, the thing that we're seeing in our experience is that you're seeing more surgery being done by high-volume gynecologists, in general, just -- not just robotic surgery but laparoscopy and others. We're seeing a consolidation in the marketplace into folks who are either GYN-oncologists or more routine surgeons. We think that's good for the world, and we think that's good for Intuitive. Those more dedicated surgeons tend to be our customers. We see them tackling more procedures in concentrated fashions, and so that's kind of what's happened in gynecology. Likewise, I think there's a demographic element here that's likely to find the bottom and then starts to drift up. The unknown is nonsurgical approaches and in-office approaches. And those are kind of the factors at play. Patrick, I'll let you go from there."

In the second quarter, our company performance was strong, highlighted by sustained procedure growth across multiple geographies, improved margins and continued customer preference for our new products. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 16%, with prior quarter trends continuing. Drivers of growth included U.S. general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States and modest growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. In renal hernia repair and hernia repair growth remained strong, and growth in colorectal surgery was solid. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with accelerating growth in Germany. Both the Nordics and France experienced modest improvement relative to Q1 growth rates. In the U.K., growth decelerated slightly from Q1. In Asia, procedural growth in Japan was solid again in the quarter, while growth in Korea was robust and accelerated over Q1 growth rate. Growth in procedures in China was also strong. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 130 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 118 in Q2 of 2015. Our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. System placement orders included an increase in dual consoles and the addition of Integrated Table Motion, leading to higher feature content on average than Q1. 
Placements in Europe and Asia increased over Q1, while U.S. placements were slightly up relative to last quarter. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call.
Our operations teams have performed well over the past several quarters and remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains. Q2 was another strong quarter of operations efficiency and cost reduction performance. We plan to continue these optimization efforts as they provide significant financial flexibility for us in coming years. 
Turning to highlights of our second quarter operating results. Procedures grew nearly 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 130 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 118 in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $670 million, up 14% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.9% compared to 68% in the second quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $339 million, up 14%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $467 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $297 million in the quarter, up 30% from the second quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $220 million, up 28% from Q2 of 2015.
Recent launches of Xi products, including Xi intraoperative table motion, have been well-received, as has expansion of advanced instrument lines, including our stapling products. We are continuing to invest in these line extensions to increase the value and utility of our Xi offering. We have also increased investment in advanced imaging, including significant refinements in our intraoperative 3D endoscopes, image processing for real-time and preoperative images and infrared imaging. 
Our single port, or SP program, is progressing to plan. As SP approaches clinical readiness, we are conducting in-house validations and initiating work with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies. We expect first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Over time, I expect this list of applications to evolve. 
As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that a substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We expect quarter-over-quarter variation in spending and increased fixed expenses in the back half of this year. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we remain focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general surgery in thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our Xi product into clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive of value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. 
We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion.
Second quarter 2016 revenue was $670 million, an increase of 14% compared with $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 and an increase of 13% compared with first quarter revenue of $595 million. Second quarter 2016 procedures increased nearly 16% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 7% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Revenue highlights are as follows: instrument and accessory revenue of $339 million increased 14% compared with last year and increased 5% compared with first quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflect procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,810 per procedure. This metric has fluctuated in a tight range over the past couple of years. The slight decrease in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our stapling and vessel sealer products. While instrument and accessory usage per procedure has been relatively constant, customer buying patterns fluctuate in the short term.
System revenue of $203 million increased 15% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 37% compared with last quarter. These increases primarily reflect higher average system selling prices, higher system placements and revenue associated with lease buyout transactions. 
130 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 118 systems in the second quarter of 2015 and 110 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 19 last quarter and 5 systems in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the second quarter, there were 66 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $4 million in the last quarter. We also generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter and $4 million in the second quarter of last year. We excluded the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system selling price of $1.56 million was approximately $60,000 higher than both the second quarter of 2015 and last quarter. The increase compared with prior quarters reflect a higher mix of dual console system and sales of table motion. We introduced intraoperative table motion in Europe in the third quarter of 2015 and early this year in the U.S. During the first and second quarters, we recognized $1 million and $6 million of table motion software, respectively. Both the mix of dual consoles and a number of table motion placements will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $128 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 3% compared with the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $185 million increased 10% compared with $168 million for the second quarter of 2015 and increased 13% compared with the first quarter of $164 million. The increase compared with the previous years comprise of 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 30% and recurring revenue growth of 4%. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 51 systems in the second quarter compared with 46 in the second quarter of 2015 and 36 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 22 into Europe, 4 into China and 13 into Japan. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy. As some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting the budget cycles or vacation patterns. And sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 71.9% compared with 68% for the second quarter of 2015 and 70% for the first quarter of 2016. Compared with the first quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects reduction in product costs, favorable costs associated with our scope exchange program, manufacturing efficiencies and higher dual console mix, lease buyouts and table motion sales. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the Medical Device Tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and decreased nearly $2 million compared with last quarter. The increase over the second quarter of 2015 reflects increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation in next-generation robotics and increased headcount. The decrease compared with the prior quarter reflects lower payroll taxes, partially offset by increased headcount costs, particularly in our product operations area.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.6% for the second quarter of 2015 and 27.4% last quarter. The increase in the tax rate compared with 2015 reflects onetime benefits reflected in 2015. Our second quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $220 million or $5.62 per share compared with $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $170 million or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we'll continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

Although our second quarter procedure growth was nearly 16%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13% and OUS procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first half of 2016, global procedure growth increased to approximately 16% compared to approximately 15% in the second half of 2015 and approximately 13% in the first half of 2016 [ph]. We expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in the second half of 2016. 
In the United States, second quarter procedure growth continued to outpace our expectations. Second quarter growth in our mature procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter. General and thoracic procedure growth remained robust. In U.S. urology, second quarter growth in da Vinci protastectomy and kidney procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer diagnoses overtime.
In U.S. gynecology, second quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedures declined compared to the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., procedures for benign gynecologic conditions slightly grew during the first half of 2016, exceeding our expectations. Second quarter U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and surgeon retention and expansion remains encouraging. Cholecystectomy procedures slightly declined in the quarter, with growth in multiport procedures nearly offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures.
Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications and presentations evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Intuitive is among the founding partners for the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative Initiative, or the AHSQC. And this quarter, 2 primary analyses comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic complex central hernia repair were brought forward. The first was a podium presentation at the American Hernia Society Annual Meeting by Dr. Palouse from Vanderbilt comparing da Vinci to open retromuscular hernia repair. This patient matched analysis involving data for multiple institutions found that da Vinci reduced hospital length of stay by 3 days without significant differences in surgical site infections, readmissions or reoperations. In addition, a paper was published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Warren and colleagues from the University of South Carolina. The authors used their institution submissions to AHSQC to compare da Vinci to laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair. Their study found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci reduced the hospital length of stay by 1 day and also enabled a greater percentage of patients to receive [indiscernible] closure and extra [indiscernible] placement of mesh to which the authors attribute a reduced likelihood of hernia recurrence for [indiscernible] lesions. 
Next, as Marshall mentioned earlier, sales of our intraoperative table motion technology were strong in the quarter. During the quarter, the first clinical publication reviewing this technology was published in the International Journal of Colorectal Disease by Dr. Morelli and colleagues from the University of Pisa. In a small case series of colorectal resections, surgeons used table motion to reposition the patient an average of 3 to 4x per procedure. The author suggested that the technology may improve patient's safety by reducing the amount of time in extreme patient physicians and stated ""The da Vinci Xi, plus the new operating table, gives the potential to optimize gravity exposure and provide a quick access to different surgical objectives, as is important for colorectal surgery.""
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, second quarter procedure growth improved in Europe and was similar to the first quarter in Asia. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure performance varied by country, with strong growth in Germany, China and South Korea. In certain countries where our urology businesses has become more mature, such as the United Kingdom and Nordic countries, procedures continue to grow at a slower rate. Emerging procedures are in an early stage in these markets, and we are engaged with a broad range of stakeholders working to enable procedure adoption in the gynecologic and general surgery. In Japan, partial nephrectomy growth accelerated in the first quarter following approval of national reimbursement. 
During the quarter, a meta-analysis sponsored by the South Korean National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, or NEHCA, was published in the Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research and reviewed da Vinci and laparoscopic colorectal colon cancer reception. The meta-analysis included nearly 700 patients and found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci surgery result in a more rapid return of normal diet and valve function of, lower blood loss and a shorter hospital stay. This government-sponsored health technology adds to the number of HTAs that have evaluated da Vinci surgery and a broad range of procedures over the years.
I will conclude my remarks by highlighting one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of da Vinci prostatectomy published in the Journal of Urology by Dr. Pearson colleagues from the University of Chicago. Using data from the National Cancer Database, study includes nearly 100,000 prostatectomy patients treated with either da Vinci or open surgery. After matching the patient populations for risk factors, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce positive surgical margins across low-, medium- and higher-risk cohorts as well as reduced use of radiation therapy, 30-day readmissions and 30-day mortality compared to open surgery. 
Dr. Kupfer from Indiana University published a letter of alongside the study titled Robotic Versus Open Prostatectomy and the Controversy, in which he stated that any debate of a robotic prostatectomy should be put to rest. 
This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures.

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. We are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%.
In regards to certain forward-looking metrics, we have the following expectations. We anticipate fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other systems revenue in Q3 and Q4 than we saw in Q2. Second half 2016 system ASPs will likely be lower than Q2, driven by product and channel mix. We expect a directionally higher proportion of our system placements in Q3 and Q4 to come from operating leases than we saw in Q2.
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will accelerate in the second half of 2016. We continue to forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels.
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income to total approximately $30 million in 2016, higher than the $20 million to $25 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

As you may now, the majority of our systems are real-time connected to the Internet today. I think over 90% of systems our online. They report that information to us mostly around the system performance itself, whether itself is doing rather than, say, patient information. That data can be turned into insights for the company and for our customers, and we have been doing that for some time now. So there's that type of analytics. Going forward, I think that it is our computational structures get more powerful, we can bring some of that intelligence more real-time. So rather than off-line insights, you can start generating real-time insights. That's a multi-year pathway. I think it's interesting and challenging. I think there is long-term potential in it. But we're moving down that pathway, making sure that we have good access and fast access and low latency access to our devices in the field and then bringing to bear information that can help surgeons as they're performing their procedure. And you'll see from us in future years a series of products that come out using that set of kind of digital pipeline. Turning to imaging. There are a couple of different things. We are releasing endoscopes that are fairly regular equipped and improving that set of technologies. We made a technology change in the type of imaging we use when we switched to Xi that has allowed for faster durations for us in the kinds of imaging we do. So there's that kind of thing that's going on, kind of a regular heartbeat. Our customers are pretty well aware of where those things are. There are other things that we've talked about, other indications for our fluorescence. We're more likely to talk to you about what's happening clinically there than to announce a launch.

This last quarter, we just saw a fewer number than the previous quarter. The previous quarter, if you recall, was 19. We would expect it to be more likely Q1 than it was Q2. So that's the increase that Calvin was referring to. As far as ASPs go, seasonally, systems revenue is stronger in Q4. Systems drive a slightly lower gross margin than do instruments and accessories. So that makes alone will cause margins to go down. We also would expect a little bit better performance, again, due to seasonal factors in the non-U.S. markets for the OUS. And so that mix also will drive revenues down a little. And then we expect to continue to see growth in stapling and vessel sealing in our newer technology products, and those also drive slightly lower margins. So a lot of mix will cause margins to go down in the next couple of quarters."

And the spread is quite big, as you look at that. There's a lot of variability in surgical performance. And so you ask the question, what drives that variability? Why? And some of it, not all of it, but some of it is that what you're looking for individual images is subtle. Where are nerves, where are cancer boundaries, where are the arteries, what's the right tissue dissection plane. Those things are subtle and take a long time for people to internalize and the best to do it better. And so what we're trying to do here is find technology that make it easier for other surgeons to be as good as the best, and we think that matters. Imaging will play a large role in this. So forward a decade, what you'd really like to be able to do is mark tissues of interest in real-time, paint for the surgeon what the elements and boundaries are that allow for a good dissection or a proper dissection or best margin performance.

What we saw in the quarter was just slight volume of growth from what we saw in the first quarter and the second half of 2015 or, frankly, all throughout 2015. How much of that is associated with having more through any potential bolus that may be out there is difficult to predict, though, I think as you for to say a few times in the past that, over time, we do expect that prostatectomy volumes are likely to return towards the rate of diagnosis. And our recent history and the recent growth rates we've seen in 2015 and the first half of 2016, we believe, exceed that growth rate."

So I think, over time, it's closer than have to come out and show what it is that they plan to do to make that happen. As we look at it, I do think there are opportunities for Intuitive to manage different price points. We have already, in terms of our capital line. And it's also true in our instrument line, and we continue to do that. So I think customers will have choice, and the choice will be, what price point do they want to enter and what benefit and value do they find at that price point. Intuitive will offer multiple price points. We will give them that opportunity. We have already, and we will continue to. And what value they find what price point will be their decision.

In the second quarter, our company performance was strong, highlighted by sustained procedure growth across multiple geographies, improved margins and continued customer preference for our new products. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 16%, with prior quarter trends continuing. Drivers of growth included U.S. general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States and modest growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. Inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair growth remained strong, and growth in colorectal surgery was solid. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with accelerating growth in Germany. Both the Nordics and France experienced modest improvement relative to Q1 growth rates. In the U.K., growth decelerated slightly from Q1. In Asia, procedural growth in Japan was solid again in the quarter, while growth in Korea was robust and accelerated over Q1 growth rate. Growth in procedures in China was also strong. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 130 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 118 in Q2 of 2015. Our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. System placement orders included an increase in dual consoles and the addition of Integrated Table Motion, leading to higher feature content on average than Q1. 
Placements in Europe and Asia increased over Q1, while U.S. placements were slightly up relative to last quarter. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call.
Our operations teams have performed well over the past several quarters and remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains. Q2 was another strong quarter of operations efficiency and cost reduction performance. We plan to continue these optimization efforts as they provide significant financial flexibility for us in coming years. 
Turning to highlights of our second quarter operating results. Procedures grew nearly 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 130 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 118 in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $670 million, up 14% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.9% compared to 68% in the second quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $339 million, up 14%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $467 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $297 million in the quarter, up 30% from the second quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $220 million, up 28% from Q2 of 2015.
Recent launches of Xi products, including Xi intraoperative table motion, have been well-received, as has expansion of advanced instrument lines, including our stapling products. We are continuing to invest in these line extensions to increase the value and utility of our Xi offering. We have also increased investment in advanced imaging, including significant refinements in our intraoperative 3D endoscopes, image processing for real-time and preoperative images and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. 
Our single port, or SP program, is progressing to plan. As SP approaches clinical readiness, we are conducting in-house validations and initiating work with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies. We expect first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Over time, I expect this list of applications to evolve. 
As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that a substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We expect quarter-to-quarter variation in spending and increased fixed expenses in the back half of this year. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we remain focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general surgery and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our SP product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."
30239,365727306,1008204,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary.

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website, so that there's no confusion.
Second quarter 2016 revenue was $670 million, an increase of 14% compared with $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 and an increase of 13% compared with first quarter revenue of $595 million. Second quarter 2016 procedures increased nearly 16% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 7% compared with last quarter. 
Procedure growth has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Revenue highlights are as follows: instrument and accessory revenue of $339 million increased 14% compared with last year and increased 5% compared with first quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflect procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,810 per procedure. This metric has fluctuated in a tight range over the past couple of years. The slight decrease in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our stapling and vessel sealer products. While instrument and accessory usage per procedure has been relatively constant, customer buying patterns fluctuate in the short term.
System revenue of $203 million increased 15% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 37% compared with last quarter. These increases primarily reflect higher average system selling prices, higher system placements and revenue associated with lease buyout transactions. 
130 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 118 systems in the second quarter of 2015 and 110 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 19 last quarter and 5 systems in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the second quarter, there were 66 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $4 million in the last quarter. We also generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter and $4 million in the second quarter of last year. We excluded the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculation. 
Globally, our average system selling price of $1.56 million was approximately $60,000 higher than both the second quarter of 2015 and last quarter. The increase compared with prior quarters reflect a higher mix of dual-console system and sales of table motion. We introduced intraoperative table motion in Europe in the third quarter of 2015 and early this year in the U.S. During the first and second quarters, we recognized $1 million and $6 million of table motion software, respectively. Both the mix of dual consoles and a number of table motion placements will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $128 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 3% compared with the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $185 million increased 10% compared with $168 million for the second quarter of 2015 and increased 13% compared with the first quarter of $164 million. The increase compared with the previous years comprise of 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 30% and recurring revenue growth of 4%. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 51 systems in the second quarter compared with 46 in the second quarter of 2015 and 36 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 22 into Europe, 4 into China and 13 into Japan. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy. As some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns. And sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 71.9% compared with 68% for the second quarter of 2015 and 70% for the first quarter of 2016. Compared with the first quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects reduction in product costs, favorable costs associated with our scope exchange program, manufacturing efficiencies and higher dual-console mix, lease buyouts and table motion sales. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and decreased nearly $2 million compared with last quarter. The increase over the second quarter of 2015 reflects increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics and increased headcount. The decrease compared with the prior quarter reflects lower payroll taxes, partially offset by increased headcount costs, particularly in our product operations area.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.6% for the second quarter of 2015 and 27.4% last quarter. The increase in the tax rate compared with 2015 reflects onetime benefits reflected in 2015. Our second quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $220 million or $5.62 per share compared with $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $170 million or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we'll continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlight."

During the first half of 2016, global procedure growth increased to approximately 16% compared to app",1033,"Thanks, Marshall. Of our second quarter procedure growth of nearly 16%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13% and OUS procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first half of 2016, global procedure growth increased to approximately 16% compared to approximately 15% in the second half of 2015 and approximately 13% in the first half of 2015. We expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in the second half of 2016. 
In the United States, second quarter procedure growth continued to outpace our expectations. Second quarter growth in our mature procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter. General and thoracic procedure growth remained robust. In U.S. urology, second quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer diagnoses over time.
In U.S. gynecology, second quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedures declined compared to the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., procedures for benign gynecologic conditions slightly grew during the first half of 2016, exceeding our expectations. Second quarter U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and surgeon retention and expansion remains encouraging. Cholecystectomy procedures slightly declined in the quarter, with growth in multiport procedures nearly offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures.
Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications and presentations evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Intuitive is among the founding partners for the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative initiative, or the AHSQC. In this quarter, 2 preliminary analyses comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic complex ventral hernia repair were brought forward. The first was a podium presentation at the American Hernia Society annual meeting by Dr. Poulose from Vanderbilt comparing da Vinci to open retromuscular hernia repair. This patient matched analysis involving data for multiple institutions found that da Vinci reduced hospital length of stay by 3 days without significant differences in surgical site infections, readmissions or reoperations. In addition, a paper was published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Warren and colleagues from the University of South Carolina. The authors used their institution submissions to AHSQC to compare da Vinci to laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair. Their study found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci reduced the hospital length of stay by 1 day and also enabled a greater percentage of patients to receive fascial closure and extraperitoneal placement of mesh to which the authors attribute a reduced likelihood of hernia recurrence for bowel adhesion.
Next, as Marshall mentioned earlier, sales of our intraoperative table motion technology were strong in the quarter. During the quarter, the first clinical publication reviewing this technology was published in the International Journal of Colorectal Disease by Dr. Morelli [ph] and colleagues from the University of Pisa. In a small case series of colorectal resections, surgeons used table motion to reposition the patient an average of 3x to 4x per procedure. The author suggested that the technology may improve patient's safety by reducing the amount of time in extreme patient physicians and stated ""The da Vinci Xi, plus the new operating table, gives the potential to optimize gravity exposure and provide a quick access to different surgical objectives that is important in colorectal surgery.""
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, second quarter procedure growth improved in Europe and was similar to the first quarter in Asia. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure performance varied by country, with strong growth in Germany, China and South Korea. In certain countries where our urology businesses has become more mature, such as the United Kingdom and Nordic countries, procedures continue to grow at a slower rate. Emerging procedures are in an early stage in these markets, and we are engaged with a broad range of stakeholders working to enable procedure adoption in the gynecologic and general surgery. In Japan, partial nephrectomy growth accelerated in the first quarter, following approval of national reimbursement. 
During the quarter, a meta-analysis sponsored by the South Korean National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, or NECA, was published in the Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research. It reviewed da Vinci and laparoscopic colon reception -- colon cancer reception. The meta-analysis included nearly 700 patients and found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci surgery resulted in a more rapid return of normal diet and bowel function, lower blood loss and a shorter hospital stay. This government-sponsored health technology assessment adds to the number of HTAs that have evaluated da Vinci surgery and a broad range of procedures over the years.
I will conclude my remarks by highlighting one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of da Vinci prostatectomy published in the Journal of Urology by Dr. Pearson [ph] colleagues from the University of Chicago. Using data from the National Cancer Data Base, the study includes nearly 100,000 prostatectomy patients treated with either da Vinci or open surgery. After matching the patient populations for risk factors, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce positive surgical margins across low-, medium- and high-risk cohorts as well as reduced use of radiation therapy, 30-day readmissions and 30-day mortality compared to open surgery. 
Dr. Cope [ph] from Indiana University published a letter alongside the study titled Robotic Versus Open Prostatectomy and the Controversy, in which he stated that any debate of a robotic prostatectomy should be put to rest. 
This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. We are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%.
In regards to certain forward-looking metrics, we have the following expectations. We anticipate fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other systems revenue in Q3 and Q4 than we saw in Q2. Second half 2016 system ASPs will likely be lower than Q2, driven by product and channel mix. We expect a directionally higher proportion of our system placements in Q3 and Q4 to come from operating leases than we saw in Q2.
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will accelerate in the second half of 2016. We continue to forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels.
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income to total approximately $30 million in 2016, higher than the $20 million to $25 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

Some of it is on the acquisition side, new kinds of endoscopes. Some of it is on the software side, and some of it is in the ability to enhance [indiscernible] imaging portfolio. Some of those things will become commercial in future quarters. Some of them are a little longer, multiyear types of investments. With regard to investments outside of R&D, we've been growing our investments in regions around the world where we think there's real opportunity from Japan to Germany and France and others. That will continue. I think that some of those investments are doing well for us. We have opportunity to perform better than we have thus far.

And again, those things can be effective from a couple of quarters out to multiyears out, depending on what the activity is."

That data can be turned into insights for the company and for our customers, and we have been doing that for some time now. So there's that type of analytics. Going forward, I think that is our computational structures get more powerful. We can bring some of that intelligence more real-time. So rather than off-line insights, you can start generating real-time insights. That's a multiyear pathway. I think it's interesting and challenging. I think there is long-term potential in it. But we're moving down that pathway, making sure that we have good access and fast access and low-latency access to our devices in the field and then bringing to bear information that can help surgeons as they're performing their procedure. And you'll see from us in future years a series of products that come out using that set of kind of digital pipeline. Turning to imaging. There are a couple of different things. We are releasing endoscopes that are fairly regular equipped [ph] and improving that set of technologies. We made a technology change in the type of imaging we use when we switched to Xi that has allowed for faster durations for us in the kinds of imaging we do.

So that's the increase that Calvin was referring to. As far as ASPs go, seasonally, systems revenue is stronger in Q4. Systems drive a slightly lower gross margin than do instruments and accessories. So that mix alone will cause margins to go down. We also would expect a little bit better performance, again, due to seasonal factors in the non-U.S. markets or the -- outside the U.S. And so that mix also will drive revenues down a little. And then we expect to continue to see growth in stapling and vessel sealing in our newer technology products, and those also drive slightly lower margins.

Other ones are things where we may want to speed up or adjust our strategy as the market evolves. As we think about the cash broadly, our first thought is can we use the cash productively to drive future growth organically? Our second thought is are there M&A opportunities that, for the long term, are good for the company? To answer the both of those, are there opportunities? The third, are there other ways we can deploy the capital with a long-term view for the benefit of shareholders? And that might be in buybacks or dividends or other things.

There's a couple of things that, I think, drive some of the variability that you see in surgery. So it's really interesting. If you ask the question, and there's some research out there, surgery, in general, not just Intuitive, how much better in terms of outcomes and lower complications is the top 10th percentile surgeon versus the average surgeon? And the spread is quite big, as you look at that. There's a lot of variability in surgical performance. And so you ask the question, what drives that variability? Why? And some of it, not all of it, but some of it is that what you're looking for individual images are subtle. Where are nerves, where are cancer boundaries, where are the arteries, what's the right tissue dissection plane. Those things are subtle and take a long time for people to internalize and the best to do it better. And so what we're trying to do here is find technology that make it easier for other surgeons to be as good as the best, and we think that matters. Imaging will play a large role in this. So play forward a decade, what you'd really like to be able to do is mark tissues of interest in real time, paint for the surgeon what the elements and boundaries are that allow for a good dissection or the proper dissection or the best margin performance. And that's what's really directing our investments."

I think that the second thing is that some of the new procedure categories we're coming in to allow for higher volume procedures, [indiscernible] Single-Sites. So more repeatable, shorter-procedure durations give you higher utilizations, just kind of the nature of the mix of product that's coming in. And lastly, I think, in some of the markets, we're seeing referral consolidations. So low-volume surgeons are referring to higher-volume surgeons, essentially passing patients to those who do more. And that also drives up utilization. So there are kind of multiple factors there that have supported the growth. I don't know that it goes on forever. I don't think there's -- if there's growth in utilization, possible. But so far, so good."

In the second quarter, our company performance was strong, highlighted by sustained procedure growth across multiple geographies, improved margins and continued customer preference for our new products. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 16%, with prior quarter trends continuing. Drivers of growth included U.S. general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States and modest growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. Inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair growth remained strong, and growth in colorectal surgery was solid. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with accelerating growth in Germany. Both the Nordics and France experienced modest improvement relative to Q1 growth rates. In the U.K., growth decelerated slightly from Q1. In Asia, procedural growth in Japan was solid again in the quarter, while growth in Korea was robust and accelerated over Q1 growth rate. Growth in procedures in China was also strong. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 130 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 118 in Q2 of 2015. Our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. System placement orders included an increase in dual consoles and the addition of Integrated Table Motion, leading to higher feature content on average than Q1. 
Placements in Europe and Asia increased over Q1, while U.S. placements were slightly up relative to last quarter. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call.
Our operations teams have performed well over the past several quarters and remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains. Q2 was another strong quarter of operations efficiency and cost reduction performance. We plan to continue these optimization efforts as they provide significant financial flexibility for us in coming years. 
Turning to highlights of our second quarter operating results. Procedures grew nearly 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 130 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 118 in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $670 million, up 14% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.9% compared to 68% in the second quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $339 million, up 14%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $467 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $297 million in the quarter, up 30% from the second quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $220 million, up 28% from Q2 of 2015.
Recent launches of Xi products, including Xi intraoperative table motion, have been well-received, as has expansion of advanced instrument lines, including our stapling products. We are continuing to invest in these line extensions to increase the value and utility of our Xi offering. We have also increased investment in advanced imaging, including significant refinements in our intraoperative 3D endoscopes, image processing for real-time and preoperative images and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. 
Our single port, or SP program, is progressing to plan. As SP approaches clinical readiness, we are conducting in-house validations and initiating work with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies. We expect first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Over time, I expect this list of applications to evolve. 
As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that a substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We expect quarter-to-quarter variation in spending and increased fixed expenses in the back half of this year. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we remain focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general surgery and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our SP product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."
30239,365727306,1008219,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP.

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website, so that there's no confusion.
Second quarter 2016 revenue was $670 million, an increase of 14% compared with $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 and an increase of 13% compared with first quarter revenue of $595 million. Second quarter 2016 procedures increased nearly 16% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 7% compared with last quarter. 
Procedure growth has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Revenue highlights are as follows: instrument and accessory revenue of $339 million increased 14% compared with last year and increased 5% compared with first quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflect procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,810 per procedure. This metric has fluctuated in a tight range over the past couple of years. The slight decrease in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our stapling and vessel sealer products. While instrument and accessory usage per procedure has been relatively constant, customer buying patterns fluctuate in the short term.
System revenue of $203 million increased 15% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 37% compared with last quarter. These increases primarily reflect higher average system selling prices, higher system placements and revenue associated with lease buyout transactions. 
130 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 118 systems in the second quarter of 2015 and 110 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 19 last quarter and 5 systems in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the second quarter, there were 66 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $4 million in the last quarter. We also generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter and $4 million in the second quarter of last year. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculation. 
Globally, our average system selling price of $1.56 million was approximately $60,000 higher than both the second quarter of 2015 and last quarter. The increase compared with prior quarters reflect a higher mix of dual-console system and sales of table motion. We introduced intraoperative table motion in Europe in the third quarter of 2015 and early this year in the U.S. During the first and second quarters, we recognized $1 million and $6 million of table motion software, respectively. Both the mix of dual consoles and a number of table motion placements will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $128 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 3% compared with the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $185 million increased 10% compared with $168 million for the second quarter of 2015 and increased 13% compared with the first quarter of $164 million. The increase compared with the previous years comprise of 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 30% and recurring revenue growth of 4%. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 51 systems in the second quarter compared with 46 in the second quarter of 2015 and 36 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 22 into Europe, 4 into China and 13 into Japan. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy. As some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns. And sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 71.9% compared with 68% for the second quarter of 2015 and 70% for the first quarter of 2016. Compared with the first quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects reduction in product costs, favorable costs associated with our scope exchange program, manufacturing efficiencies and higher dual-console mix, lease buyouts and table motion sales. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and decreased nearly $2 million compared with last quarter. The increase over the second quarter of 2015 reflects increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics and increased headcount. The decrease compared with the prior quarter reflects lower payroll taxes, partially offset by increased headcount costs, particularly in our product operations area.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.6% for the second quarter of 2015 and 27.4% last quarter. The increase in the tax rate compared with 2015 reflects onetime benefits reflected in 2015. Our second quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $220 million or $5.62 per share compared with $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $170 million or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we'll continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlight."

Of our second quarter procedure growth of nearly 16%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13% and OUS procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first half of 2016, global procedure growth increased to approximately 16% compared to approximately 15% in the second half of 2015 and approximately 13% in the first half of 2015. We expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in the second half of 2016. 
In the United States, second quarter procedure growth continued to outpace our expectations. Second quarter growth in our mature procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter. General and thoracic procedure growth remained robust. In U.S. urology, second quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer diagnoses over time.
In U.S. gynecology, second quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedures declined compared to the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., procedures for benign gynecologic conditions slightly grew during the first half of 2016, exceeding our expectations. Second quarter U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and surgeon retention and expansion remains encouraging. Cholecystectomy procedures slightly declined in the quarter, with growth in multiport procedures nearly offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures.
Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications and presentations evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Intuitive is among the founding partners for the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative initiative, or the AHSQC. In this quarter, 2 preliminary analyses comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic complex ventral hernia repair were brought forward. The first was a podium presentation at the American Hernia Society annual meeting by Dr. Poulose from Vanderbilt comparing da Vinci to open retromuscular hernia repair. This patient matched analysis involving data for multiple institutions found that da Vinci reduced hospital length of stay by 3 days without significant differences in surgical site infections, readmissions or reoperations. In addition, a paper was published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Warren and colleagues from the University of South Carolina. The authors used their institution submissions to AHSQC to compare da Vinci to laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair. Their study found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci reduced the hospital length of stay by 1 day and also enabled a greater percentage of patients to receive fascial closure and extraperitoneal placement of mesh to which the authors attribute a reduced likelihood of hernia recurrence for bowel adhesion.
Next, as Marshall mentioned earlier, sales of our intraoperative table motion technology were strong in the quarter. During the quarter, the first clinical publication reviewing this technology was published in the International Journal of Colorectal Disease by Dr. Morelli [ph] and colleagues from the University of Pisa. In a small case series of colorectal resections, surgeons used table motion to reposition the patient an average of 3x to 4x per procedure. The author suggested that the technology may improve patient's safety by reducing the amount of time in extreme patient physicians and stated ""The da Vinci Xi, plus the new operating table, gives the potential to optimize gravity exposure and provide a quick access to different surgical objectives that is important in colorectal surgery.""
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, second quarter procedure growth improved in Europe and was similar to the first quarter in Asia. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure performance varied by country, with strong growth in Germany, China and South Korea. In certain countries where our urology businesses has become more mature, such as the United Kingdom and Nordic countries, procedures continue to grow at a slower rate. Emerging procedures are in an early stage in these markets, and we are engaged with a broad range of stakeholders working to enable procedure adoption in the gynecologic and general surgery. In Japan, partial nephrectomy growth accelerated in the first quarter, following approval of national reimbursement. 
During the quarter, a meta-analysis sponsored by the South Korean National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, or NECA, was published in the Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research. It reviewed da Vinci and laparoscopic colon reception -- colon cancer reception. The meta-analysis included nearly 700 patients and found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci surgery resulted in a more rapid return of normal diet and bowel function, lower blood loss and a shorter hospital stay. This government-sponsored health technology assessment adds to the number of HTAs that have evaluated da Vinci surgery and a broad range of procedures over the years.
I will conclude my remarks by highlighting one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of da Vinci prostatectomy published in the Journal of Urology by Dr. Pearson [ph] colleagues from the University of Chicago. Using data from the National Cancer Data Base, the study includes nearly 100,000 prostatectomy patients treated with either da Vinci or open surgery. After matching the patient populations for risk factors, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce positive surgical margins across low-, medium- and high-risk cohorts as well as reduced use of radiation therapy, 30-day readmissions and 30-day mortality compared to open surgery. 
Dr. Cope [ph] from Indiana University published a letter alongside the study titled Robotic Versus Open Prostatectomy: End the Controversy, in which he stated that any debate of a robotic prostatectomy should be put to rest. 
This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. We are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%.
In regards to certain forward-looking metrics, we have the following expectations. We anticipate fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other systems revenue in Q3 and Q4 than we saw in Q2. Second half 2016 system ASPs will likely be lower than Q2, driven by product and channel mix. We expect a directionally higher proportion of our system placements in Q3 and Q4 to come from operating leases than we saw in Q2.
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will accelerate in the second half of 2016. We continue to forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels.
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income to total approximately $30 million in 2016, higher than the $20 million to $25 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

As we've said before, I think the messaging here has been pretty consistent. Some of the investments are in technology, things like SP starting to move into field-based investment and scale rather than just the upfront D. So you're seeing some growth in that. We have some other technology investments that are a little broader. We've talked about imaging, and that's kind of a multistep process. Some of it is on the acquisition side, new kinds of endoscopes. Some of it is on the software side, and some of it is in the ability to enhance our florescence imaging portfolio. Some of those things will become commercial in future quarters. Some of them are a little longer, multiyear types of investments. With regard to investments outside of R&D, we've been growing our investments in regions around the world where we think there's real opportunity from Japan to Germany and France and others. That will continue. I think that some of those investments are doing well for us. We have opportunity to perform better than we have thus far. And so the right kinds of investments there are sometimes in clinical data and clinical trials, sometimes in other market development efforts, sometimes in our resources and headcount. And again, those things can be effective from a couple of quarters out to multi-years out, depending on what the activity is."

As you may know, the majority of our systems are real-time connected to the Internet today. I think over 90% of systems are online. They report back information to us mostly around the system performance itself, whether is itself is doing rather than, say, patient information. That data can be turned into insights for the company and for our customers, and we have been doing that for some time now. So there's that type of analytics. Going forward, I think that as our computational structures get more powerful. We can bring some of that intelligence more real-time. So rather than off-line insights, you can start generating real-time insights. That's a multiyear pathway. I think it's interesting and challenging. I think there is long-term potential in it. But we're moving down that pathway, making sure that we have good access and fast access and low-latency access to our devices in the field and then bringing to bear information that can help surgeons as they're performing their procedure. And you'll see from us in future years a series of products that come out using that set of kind of digital pipeline. Turning to imaging. There are a couple of different things. We are releasing endoscopes at a fairly regular clip and improving that set of technologies. We made a technology change in the type of imaging we use when we switched to Xi that has allowed for faster durations for us in the kinds of imaging we do. So there's that kind of thing that's going on, kind of a regular heartbeat. Our customers are pretty well aware of where those things are.

Last quarter, we just saw a fewer number than the previous quarter. The previous quarter, if you recall, was 19. We would expect it to be more like Q1 than it was Q2. So that's the increase that Calvin was referring to. As far as ASPs go, seasonally, systems revenue is stronger in Q4. Systems drive a slightly lower gross margin than do instruments and accessories. So that mix alone will cause margins to go down. We also would expect a little bit better performance, again, due to seasonal factors in the non-U.S. markets or the -- outside the U.S. And so that mix also will drive revenues down a little. And then we expect to continue to see growth in stapling and vessel sealing in our newer technology products, and those also drive slightly lower margins.

There's a couple of things that, I think, drive some of the variability that you see in surgery. So it's really interesting. If you ask the question, and there's some research out there, surgery, in general, not just Intuitive, how much better in terms of outcomes and lower complications is the top 10th percentile surgeon versus the average surgeon? And the spread is quite big, as you look at that. There's a lot of variability in surgical performance. And so you ask the question, what drives that variability? Why? And some of it, not all of it, but some of it is that what you're looking for individual images are subtle. Where are nerves, where are cancer boundaries, where are the arteries, what's the right tissue dissection plane. Those things are subtle and take a long time for people to internalize and the best to do it better. And so what we're trying to do here is find technology that make it easier for other surgeons to be as good as the best, and we think that matters. Imaging will play a large role in this. So play forward a decade, what you'd really like to be able to do is mark tissues of interest in real time, paint for the surgeon what the elements and boundaries are that allow for a good dissection or the proper dissection or the best margin performance. And that's what's really directing our investments."

And it just happens, and it's going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. And that was my comment in the short term. And so what we saw this quarter was they used more than they purchased. And so I don't have a great explanation for it beyond that. That's just what we see. On the other hand, we do have distributors that buy in bulk because their holding inventory to sell to their end customers. And we do see fluctuations in those numbers as well.

In the second quarter, our company performance was strong, highlighted by sustained procedure growth across multiple geographies, improved margins and continued customer preference for our new products. 
Turning first to procedures. Global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly 16%, with prior quarter trends continuing. Drivers of growth included U.S. general surgery, growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States and modest growth in U.S. urology and gynecology. Inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair growth remained strong, and growth in colorectal surgery was solid. Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe, with accelerating growth in Germany. Both the Nordics and France experienced modest improvement relative to Q1 growth rates. In the U.K., growth decelerated slightly from Q1. In Asia, procedural growth in Japan was solid again in the quarter, while growth in Korea was robust and accelerated over Q1 growth rate. Growth in procedures in China was also strong. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 130 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 118 in Q2 of 2015. Our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. System placement orders included an increase in dual consoles and the addition of Integrated Table Motion, leading to higher feature content on average than Q1. 
Placements in Europe and Asia increased over Q1, while U.S. placements were slightly up relative to last quarter. Marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call.
Our operations teams have performed well over the past several quarters and remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing, design and supply chains. Q2 was another strong quarter of operations efficiency and cost reduction performance. We plan to continue these optimization efforts as they provide significant financial flexibility for us in coming years. 
Turning to highlights of our second quarter operating results. Procedures grew nearly 16% over the second quarter of last year. We shipped 130 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 118 in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $670 million, up 14% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.9% compared to 68% in the second quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $339 million, up 14%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $467 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $297 million in the quarter, up 30% from the second quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $220 million, up 28% from Q2 of 2015.
Recent launches of Xi products, including Xi intraoperative table motion, have been well-received, as has expansion of advanced instrument lines, including our stapling products. We are continuing to invest in these line extensions to increase the value and utility of our Xi offering. We have also increased investment in advanced imaging, including significant refinements in our intraoperative 3D endoscopes, image processing for real-time and preoperative images and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. 
Our single port, or SP program, is progressing to plan. As SP approaches clinical readiness, we are conducting in-house validations and initiating work with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies. We expect first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. Over time, I expect this list of applications to evolve. 
As our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in research and development. We've been increasing our investments in imaging, analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that a substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. We expect quarter-to-quarter variation in spending and increased fixed expenses in the back half of this year. Calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call. 
As we move forward in 2016, we remain focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general surgery and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including expanding our Xi line and taking our SP product into initial clinical use; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will review financial highlights."
30239,365727306,1008817,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary.

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website, so that there's no confusion.
Second quarter 2016 revenue was $670 million, an increase of 14% compared with $586 million for the second quarter of 2015 and an increase of 13% compared with first quarter revenue of $595 million. Second quarter 2016 procedures increased nearly 16% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 7% compared with last quarter. 
Procedure growth has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Revenue highlights are as follows: instrument and accessory revenue of $339 million increased 14% compared with last year and increased 5% compared with first quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflect procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including stocking orders, was approximately $1,810 per procedure. This metric has fluctuated in a tight range over the past couple of years. The slight decrease in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns, partially offset by increased usage of our stapling and vessel sealer products. While instrument and accessory usage per procedure has been relatively constant, customer buying patterns fluctuate in the short term.
System revenue of $203 million increased 15% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and increased 37% compared with last quarter. These increases primarily reflect higher average system selling prices, higher system placements and revenue associated with lease buyout transactions. 
130 systems were placed in the second quarter compared with 118 systems in the second quarter of 2015 and 110 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 19 last quarter and 5 systems in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the second quarter, there were 66 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $4 million in the last quarter. We also generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter and $4 million in the second quarter of last year. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculation. 
Globally, our average system selling price of $1.56 million was approximately $60,000 higher than both the second quarter of 2015 and last quarter. The increase compared with prior quarters reflect a higher mix of dual-console system and sales of table motion. We introduced intraoperative table motion in Europe in the third quarter of 2015 and early this year in the U.S. During the first and second quarters, we recognized $1 million and $6 million of table motion software, respectively. Both the mix of dual consoles and a number of table motion placements will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
Service revenue of $128 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 3% compared with the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: second quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $185 million increased 10% compared with $168 million for the second quarter of 2015 and increased 13% compared with the first quarter of $164 million. The increase compared with the previous years comprise of 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 2%. The increase compared to the first quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 30% and recurring revenue growth of 4%. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 51 systems in the second quarter compared with 46 in the second quarter of 2015 and 36 systems last quarter. Current quarter system sales included 22 into Europe, 4 into China and 13 into Japan. System placements outside the U.S. will continue to be lumpy. As some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns. And sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. The pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 71.9% compared with 68% for the second quarter of 2015 and 70% for the first quarter of 2016. Compared with the first quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects reduction in product costs, favorable costs associated with our scope exchange program, manufacturing efficiencies and higher dual-console mix, lease buyouts and table motion sales. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and decreased nearly $2 million compared with last quarter. The increase over the second quarter of 2015 reflects increased investments in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics and increased headcount. The decrease compared with the prior quarter reflects lower payroll taxes, partially offset by increased headcount costs, particularly in our product operations area.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.8% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.6% for the second quarter of 2015 and 27.4% last quarter. The increase in the tax rate compared with 2015 reflects onetime benefits reflected in 2015. Our second quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $220 million or $5.62 per share compared with $173 million or $4.57 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $170 million or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016. As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $135 million or $3.56 per share for the second quarter of 2015 and $136 million or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we'll continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlight."

Of our second quarter procedure growth of nearly 16%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 13% and OUS procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first half of 2016, global procedure growth increased to approximately 16% compared to approximately 15% in the second half of 2015 and approximately 13% in the first half of 2015. We expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in the second half of 2016. 
In the United States, second quarter procedure growth continued to outpace our expectations. Second quarter growth in our mature procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter. General and thoracic procedure growth remained robust. In U.S. urology, second quarter growth in da Vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market, and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer diagnoses over time.
In U.S. gynecology, second quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci Hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Similar to the first quarter, U.S. Single-Site gynecology procedures declined compared to the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., procedures for benign gynecologic conditions slightly grew during the first half of 2016, exceeding our expectations. Second quarter U.S. general surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and surgeon retention and expansion remains encouraging. Cholecystectomy procedures slightly declined in the quarter, with growth in multiport procedures nearly offsetting declines in Single-Site procedures.
Second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications and presentations evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Intuitive is among the founding partners for the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative initiative, or the AHSQC. In this quarter, 2 preliminary analyses comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic complex ventral hernia repair were brought forward. The first was a podium presentation at the American Hernia Society annual meeting by Dr. Poulose from Vanderbilt comparing da Vinci to open retromuscular hernia repair. This patient matched analysis involving data for multiple institutions found that da Vinci reduced hospital length of stay by 3 days without significant differences in surgical site infections, readmissions or reoperations. In addition, a paper was published in Surgical Endoscopy by Dr. Warren and colleagues from the University of South Carolina. The authors used their institution submissions to AHSQC to compare da Vinci to laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair. Their study found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci reduced the hospital length of stay by 1 day and also enabled a greater percentage of patients to receive fascial closure and extraperitoneal placement of mesh to which the authors attribute a reduced likelihood of hernia recurrence for bowel adhesion.
Next, as Marshall mentioned earlier, sales of our intraoperative table motion technology were strong in the quarter. During the quarter, the first clinical publication reviewing this technology was published in the International Journal of Colorectal Disease by Dr. Morelli [ph] and colleagues from the University of Pisa. In a small case series of colorectal resections, surgeons used table motion to reposition the patient an average of 3x to 4x per procedure. The author suggested that the technology may improve patient's safety by reducing the amount of time in extreme patient physicians and stated ""The da Vinci Xi, plus the new operating table, gives the potential to optimize gravity exposure and provide a quick access to different surgical objectives that is important in colorectal surgery.""
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the second quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, second quarter procedure growth improved in Europe and was similar to the first quarter in Asia. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure performance varied by country, with strong growth in Germany, China and South Korea. In certain countries where our urology businesses has become more mature, such as the United Kingdom and Nordic countries, procedures continue to grow at a slower rate. Emerging procedures are in an early stage in these markets, and we are engaged with a broad range of stakeholders working to enable procedure adoption in the gynecologic and general surgery. In Japan, partial nephrectomy growth accelerated in the first quarter, following approval of national reimbursement. 
During the quarter, a meta-analysis sponsored by the South Korean National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, or NECA, was published in the Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research. It reviewed da Vinci and laparoscopic colon reception -- colon cancer reception. The meta-analysis included nearly 700 patients and found that with a longer operative time, da Vinci surgery resulted in a more rapid return of normal diet and bowel function, lower blood loss and a shorter hospital stay. This government-sponsored health technology assessment adds to the number of HTAs that have evaluated da Vinci surgery and a broad range of procedures over the years.
I will conclude my remarks by highlighting one of the largest population-based studies on the impact of da Vinci prostatectomy published in the Journal of Urology by Dr. Pearson [ph] colleagues from the University of Chicago. Using data from the National Cancer Data Base, the study includes nearly 100,000 prostatectomy patients treated with either da Vinci or open surgery. After matching the patient populations for risk factors, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce positive surgical margins across low-, medium- and high-risk cohorts as well as reduced use of radiation therapy, 30-day readmissions and 30-day mortality compared to open surgery. 
Dr. Cope [ph] from Indiana University published a letter alongside the study titled Robotic Versus Open Prostatectomy: End the Controversy, in which he stated that any debate of a robotic prostatectomy should be put to rest. 
This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 12% to 14% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. We are increasing our estimate for 2016. We now anticipate full year 2016 procedure growth within a range of 14% to 15%.
In regards to certain forward-looking metrics, we have the following expectations. We anticipate fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other systems revenue in Q3 and Q4 than we saw in Q2. Second half 2016 system ASPs will likely be lower than Q2, driven by product and channel mix. We expect a directionally higher proportion of our system placements in Q3 and Q4 to come from operating leases than we saw in Q2.
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 70% of net revenue. We are now increasing our estimate. We now expect full year 2016 pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will accelerate in the second half of 2016. We continue to forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels.
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015. We expect other income to total approximately $30 million in 2016, higher than the $20 million to $25 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, we continue to expect our 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

As we've said before, I think the messaging here has been pretty consistent. Some of the investments are in technology, things like SP starting to move into field-based investment and scale rather than just the upfront D. So you're seeing some growth in that. We have some other technology investments that are a little broader. We've talked about imaging, and that's kind of a multistep process. Some of it is on the acquisition side, new kinds of endoscopes. Some of it is on the software side, and some of it is in the ability to enhance our fluorescence imaging portfolio. Some of those things will become commercial in future quarters. Some of them are a little longer, multiyear types of investments. With regard to investments outside of R&D, we've been growing our investments in regions around the world where we think there's real opportunity from Japan to Germany and France and others. That will continue. I think that some of those investments are doing well for us. We have opportunity to perform better than we have thus far.

As you may know, the majority of our systems are real-time connected to the Internet today. I think over 90% of systems are online.

That data can be turned into insights for the company and for our customers, and we have been doing that for some time now. So there's that type of analytics. Going forward, I think that as our computational structures get more powerful. We can bring some of that intelligence more real-time. So rather than off-line insights, you can start generating real-time insights. That's a multiyear pathway. I think it's interesting and challenging. I think there is long-term potential in it. But we're moving down that pathway, making sure that we have good access and fast access and low-latency access to our devices in the field and then bringing to bear information that can help surgeons as they're performing their procedure. And you'll see from us in future years a series of products that come out using that set of kind of digital pipeline. Turning to imaging. There are a couple of different things. We are releasing endoscopes at a fairly regular clip and improving that set of technologies. We made a technology change in the type of imaging we use when we switched to Xi that has allowed for faster durations for us in the kinds of imaging we do. So there's that kind of thing that's going on, kind of a regular heartbeat. Our customers are pretty well aware of where those things are. There are other things that we've talked about, other indications for our fluorescence. We're more likely to talk to you about what's happening clinically there than to announce a launch.

Last quarter, we just saw a fewer number than the previous quarter. The previous quarter, if you recall, was 19. We would expect it to be more like Q1 than it was Q2. So that's the increase that Calvin was referring to. As far as ASPs go, seasonally, systems revenue is stronger in Q4. Systems drive a slightly lower gross margin than do instruments and accessories. So that mix alone will cause margins to go down. We also would expect a little bit better performance, again, due to seasonal factors in the non-U.S. markets or the -- outside the U.S. And so that mix also will drive revenues down a little. And then we expect to continue to see growth in stapling and vessel sealing in our newer technology products, and those also drive slightly lower margins.

If you ask the question, and there's some research out there, surgery, in general, not just Intuitive, how much better in terms of outcomes and lower complications is the top 10th percentile surgeon versus the average surgeon? And the spread is quite big, as you look at that. There's a lot of variability in surgical performance. And so you ask the question, what drives that variability? Why? And some of it, not all of it, but some of it is that what you're looking for individual images are subtle. Where are nerves, where are cancer boundaries, where are the arteries, what's the right tissue dissection plane. Those things are subtle and take a long time for people to internalize and the best to do it better. And so what we're trying to do here is find technology that make it easier for other surgeons to be as good as the best, and we think that matters. Imaging will play a large role in this. So play forward a decade, what you'd really like to be able to do is mark tissues of interest in real time, paint for the surgeon what the elements and boundaries are that allow for a good dissection or the proper dissection or the best margin performance.

We look at where we sit 6 months into the year. We're at 71% on a year-to-date basis, and that coincides with the upper end of the 70% to 70% -- 70% to 71% guidance range. But Q2 was an exceptionally strong quarter for gross margin, and I think we wanted to leave some specific comments there, specifically on the product side. We would expect a higher proportion of sales of newer products, as was described in lower proportion of dual-console sales and probably more sales through distributors at lower pricing and lower margins. And I think I already mentioned previously on the service side, we had some real benefits on the scope exchange in the second quarter, which are unlikely to continue in the second half."

We have already, in terms of our capital line, and it's also true in our instrument line, and we can continue to do that. So I think customers will have choice.

We will give them that opportunity. We have already, and we will continue to. And what value they find at what price point will be their decision.

So more repeatable, shorter-procedure durations give you higher utilizations, just kind of the nature of the mix of product that's coming in. And lastly, I think, in some of the markets, we're seeing referral consolidations. So low-volume surgeons are referring to higher-volume surgeons, essentially passing patients to those who do more.

Our company performance in the quarter was solid, with increasing customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. 
Global procedural growth was over 14% year-over-year in the quarter. Drivers of growth centered on U.S. general surgery and growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States. In the United States, year-over-year growth in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to be strong. U.S. colon resection and lung resection also contributed to solid growth. As we've stated in prior calls, we are expecting growth rates in mature procedures in the U.S. to moderate, and U.S. EBP is starting to follow this pattern, driven by the macroeconomic environment for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
In Europe, procedure growth tempered in the quarter, with some countries posting solid performance while growth softened in others. 
We're pleased with growth in procedures in Asia, with Korea and China, in particular, demonstrating continued strength. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 134 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 117 in Q3 of 2015. While we offer a range of models and price points, our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, again represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. As we've said on previous calls, capital placements are lumpy, and this quarter was no exception. 
Healthy placements stood out in the U.S., while placements in our European regions softened relative to a year ago. Capital placements in Asia are particularly unpredictable, given environment constraints like reimbursements in Japan and quotas in China. Placements in Asia were in line with prior quarters. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin dynamics. We experienced some onetime tailwinds in the quarter that contributed to higher-than-expected net income. Marshall will take you through these events and our general finances in greater detail later in the call. 
Turning to highlights of our third quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 14% over the fourth -- third quarter of last year. We shipped 134 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $683 million, up 16% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 73.1% compared to 16 -- 69.3% in the third quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $348 million, up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $478 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $308 million in the quarter, up 28% from the third quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $246 million, up 23% from Q3 of 2015. 
As we discussed with you on our last call, as our businesses strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We've been increasing these investments based on our belief that our -- that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. 
We continue to enhance features and expand access to our Xi suite of instruments, accessories and imaging products. In the third quarter, we added the ability to ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries. In addition, interoperative table motion uptake and performance is meeting our expectations. We are continuing to invest in the expansion and refinement of our base instrument, stapling and vessel sealing products for our Xi platform. 
New system platforms continue to make good progress. Our da Vinci single port is progressing in its in-house clinical evaluations and preparations for human clinical trials expected later this quarter. As we've discussed on our prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. 
SP is a platform technology that allows high-dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. Commentary by surgeons after in-house evaluations have indicated strong interest in the clinical potential of this platform. 
In the quarter, we also announced the creation of a joint venture with Fosun Pharma, owner of our current da Vinci partner in China. The JV's first objectives are to work with ISI and Fosun to produce products that address an acute need in the diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection and treatment are important. 
The technology underpinning the system is based on computer-controlled catheters, advanced image processing and sophisticated sensing. It incorporates a substantial set of proprietary intellectual property developed, owned or licensed by Intuitive over the past several years. This system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience, and final clearance and launch targets are not yet set. That said, the raw capability of the technology is compelling, and it has the potential to perform as a broader diagnostic and treatment platform over time. 
Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment. We've added approximately 400 employees year-to-date and expect increased fixed investments and some lumpiness in spending in future quarters as these platforms move through design, validation, data collection and early launch. 
As we close 2016, we have focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including new clearances, additional clinical and economic validation, training centers and the expansion of our product offerings; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll review financial highlights."

I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Third quarter 2016 revenue was $683 million, an increase of 16% compared with $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter revenue of $670 million. Third quarter 2016 procedures increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. The decrease relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects seasonality. 
Revenue highlights are as follows.  Instrument and accessory revenue of $348 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflects procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,810 last quarter. The increase is relative to the third quarter of 2015 and last quarter reflects increased sales for stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2016 also reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. 
System revenue of $205 million increased 18% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts, partially offset by lower average system selling prices. 
We generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $13 million last quarter. While lease buyouts are difficult to predict, we expect the level of fourth quarter lease buyouts to be below those of the third quarter.
134 systems were placed in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 117 systems in the third quarter of 2015 and 130 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 last quarter and 13 systems in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the third quarter, there were 74 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately $4 million last quarter. We excluded the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price was $1.53 million compared with $1.61 million last year and $1.56 million last quarter. The decreases compared with prior periods primarily reflect a lower mix of dual console systems, partially offset by a lower mix of trade-in systems in the third quarter of 2016. 
Service revenue of $130 million increased 10% year-over-year and increased approximately 1% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $189 million increased 25% compared with $151 million for the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2% compared with $185 million for the second quarter. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 26% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 24%. The increase compared to the second quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 2% and recurring revenue growth of 2% in a seasonally slower quarter. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 49 systems in the third quarter compared with 37 in the third quarter of 2015 and 51 systems last quarter. 
Current quarter system sales included 18 into Europe, 2 into China 11 into Japan and 18 in the rest of world markets. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns. And sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 73.1% compared with 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015 and 71.9% for the second quarter of 2016. 
The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included $7.1 million of Medical Device Tax refunds. Without the Medical Device Tax refunds, our pro forma gross margin would have been the same as the second quarter or 72%. 
Compared with the third quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs, the Medical Device Tax refunds and manufacturing efficiencies. 
Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of system and instrument and accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the Medical Device Tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $6 million compared with last quarter. The increases reflect increased headcount, increased product development activities and investments in our OUS commercial organization. 
We added over 400 employees, primarily into product operations area, over the past year. The increase compared with the prior quarter primarily reflects increased headcount costs. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.7% compared with an effective rate of 18.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 27.8% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter of 2016 tax rate reflected $16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute limitation expirations in various jurisdictions. The third quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party.  Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and with the impact of one-time items. 
Our third quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $246 million or $6.19 per share compared with $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
Excluding onetime income tax and Medical Device Tax benefits, pro forma net income would have been $225 million or $5.65 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. 
GAAP net income was $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14%; U.S. procedures grew approximately 11%; and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 25%. 
During the first 3 quarters of 2016, global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In the United States, taken together, growth in our mature procedures slowed in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. General and thoracic procedure growth remained healthy. 
In U.S. urology, third quarter growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy slowed to low single-digit growth, a level that we believe to be similar to the overall rate of diagnoses of new prostate cancers. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Procedures for benign gynecologic conditions grew modestly during the third quarter, continuing a trend from the first half of the year. 
Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. 
Cholecystectomy procedures declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures being offset by declines in Single-Site procedures. Early-stage adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures is encouraging. 
Last month, at the global symposium on robotic-assisted and minimally invasive hernia repair, several new data sets comparing da Vinci to open and laparoscopic hernia repair were presented. Among the most notable presentation, Dr. Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic, presented new data on retromuscular ventral hernia repair from the American Hernia Society's Quality Collaborative or the AHSQC. 
In a prospective cohort of more than 400 patients, case match between da Vinci and open surgery, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce the length of hospitalization by 2.5 days compared to open surgery, with similar levels of wound outcomes, readmissions and reoperations. Intuitive is a founding partner of AHSQC and we are supporting its expansion to include data for inguinal hernia repair. 
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the third quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Europe and Asia was similar to the first half of the year, though procedure performance varied by country.  Strong growth continued in China, South Korea, Japan and Germany. 
While adoption of da Vinci in urology is the primary driver of procedure growth outside of the United States, we are seeing multi-specialty adoption in certain countries. In China, roughly half of the year-to-date procedure growth has come from categories outside of urology. In South Korea, approximately 60% of the year-to-date procedures have come from categories outside of urology. 
We are investing in the development of clinical evidence to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery in markets around the world. Globally, we support several evidence initiatives and registries, including AHSQC, gynecologic oncology societal Registries in the U.S. and Europe and the colorectal registry in Europe. In the U.S., we are also supporting several comparative prospective and retrospective multicenter studies on hernia repair, colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. Outside of the United States, we are sponsoring clinical studies in Japan to support reimbursements submissions for malignant hysterectomy and gastrectomy. In Europe, we provide support for studies in colorectal, thoracic and gynecological oncology. We are committed to developing evidence in key markets to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery where our technology can bring value to hospitals, surgeons, patients. 
Third quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I've selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Dr. [indiscernible] and colleagues from Indiana University published a study in Surgical Endoscopy comparing da Vinci to laparoscopic colorectal procedures captured in the American College of Surgeons' national surgical quality improvement project or inscript database from 2011 through 2014. Including over 27,000 procedures across a range of colorectal resections, in exchange for approximately 45-minute longer operative time, da Vinci low anterior sections and right [indiscernible] showed a reduction in conversion rates. Left colectomies trended towards a reduction in conversion rates without statistical significance. Low anterior resections also showed a lower rate of sepsis with a higher rate of [indiscernible]. Across all cohorts, da Vinci surgery generated a reduction in length of hospital stay. 
The next study was published by Dr. Osman and colleagues from the University in Istanbul, Turkey, in the General of Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy and Percutaneous Technologies. In the small case series, the author continues their performance in rectal resections on da Vinci Xi to da Vinci SI. They found that da Vinci Xi was associated with an approximate 40 minutes of reduced operative time. The reduction in operative time was attributable to an elimination of double docking and hybrid surgeries and the da Vinci Xi cohort. The surgeons also found that da Vinci Xi patient population experienced an increase in lymph nodes harvested and quicker return of [indiscernible] function with a 1 day longer length of hospital stay. The authors concluded ""The Xi generation appeared to allow short consult times, and its broader capabilities promise to make it a lot easier for surgeons to perform this complex robotic procedure."" 
While this study highlights the enhanced capabilities of da Vinci Xi per multi quadrant surgery such as rectal resection, our da Vinci SI installed bases remained stable in 2016 as customers continue to find value in its utilization. Taken together, procedures performed on da Vinci Si and Xi platforms represented over 95% of our third quarter procedures. 
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015.",525,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016. 
Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to forecast full year procedure growth of 14% to 15%, likely towards the higher end of the range. 
With regard to Q4 2016 system placements, we directionally expect system placements for the quarter to follow recent seasonal trends. However, we anticipate system placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of our U.S., OUS markets are in early stages of adoption and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. Recall, we placed 13 systems into China and 7 systems into Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2015. As the quota in China expired in 2015 and a new quota has not yet been issued, and as we are in the very early stages of adoption in Brazil, we do not expect comparables and placements into these markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Also, we believe that the flexibility we have offered customers in the form of operating leases has been well received. As a result, as compared to prior periods, we expect a higher proportion of Q4 2016 placements to be under operating leases, with revenue recognized in future periods. 
Finally, we expect to see a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous 2 quarters, given the lower number of short-term leases that are outstanding at this time. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be approximately 71.5% of net revenue. As Marshall indicated, the third quarter benefited from a $7.1 million Medical Device Tax refund. Excluding that benefit, our gross profit margin would have been 72%. We expect our fourth quarter margin to be directionally lower than the third quarter, primarily due to product mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will continue to accelerate. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. We are now refining this range to 13% to 14%. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015.
We expect other income to total approximately $33 million in 2016, higher than the $30 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, consistent with previous guidance, we expect our Q4 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

Currently, the current configuration it's in, it's a stand-alone. Those types of technologies in the future could be integrated into other things, and we won't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do conceive of it as a way to access the body through natural orifices and other means, where you want to follow up a prescribed pathway to get to some deep place in the body and do something. Our first clinical interest is in biopsing lung cancers or biopsing suspicious lesions in the lung. We think that, that is important globally and particularly important in China. And as a result, the partnership with Fosun, who we've known through their [indiscernible] company for many years, made a lot of sense to us. And we're excited about it.

I think, as you think about SP, SP shares a lot in architecture and in kind of underlying technology with the Xi platform. We do think it branches us into places that are hard to reach otherwise, literally hard to reach with conventional technologies, open surgery, conventional laparoscopy or with Xi. So we think SP can broaden clinically what surgeons can do. I think that will start in niches and then will move out into broader applications as we gain clinical experience. It does increase our support load a little bit in terms of complexity with regard to the SP just because it's a new set of instruments and add-on accessories. But it's not an entirely new set of compositional platform and things like that. As you start thinking about that catheter-based technologies, again, that's a new set of technologies. You had kind of framed it in 2-year horizon. I would stretch that horizon out a little bit. I wouldn't anchor us there. I do think that takes us to different places. I think it allows access to parts of the body that you may not think of surgically. It may be more around diagnostics. And I think it will open up to practitioners' ways of approaching tissue that they just haven't thought about before. And that's why we're doing it. That -- you've seen us increase our R&D spend, and we've been both talking about in doing it. And part of it has been investing in these technologies. And I think it matters. I think as people look, as we look from the bottom of your feet to the top of you had to look for opportunities to get better outcomes, we think of a variety of technologies from access technologies to imaging technologies to computational technologies that can lower and make a difference, and that's where we're putting our mouth is."

Kind of give us your state of the state in terms of where you are in hernia and kind of the trajectory of adoption relative to some of the historical adopting procedures, if you would.
Yes, hernia continues to be encouraging. The rates of both procedure adoption, surgeon retention and utilization within the existing surgeon population as they continue to do more procedures has been a strong point and the way in which the technology is going to be adopted. Now hernia repairs was not one thing. So there's a variety of patients subsets within, variety of different physician perspectives around the value that our technology can bring into the procedure. And so it's probably not quite like DPB in terms of the way you would think of it is been adopted, maybe a little more benign hysterectomy, given the alternative therapies and the heterogeneous landscape out there in terms of how they address these patients."

You probably recall last quarter, it actually dropped down to $1,810, and we talked about timing of orders being the main factor here. So as expected here in Q3, we saw orders rebound to offset Q2. And if you take the average of Q2 and Q3 right back at the $1,840, kind of in line with those trends over the past couple of years. As we said, though, we continue to see increasing utilization of the advanced instruments, including those stapler and vessel sealer. And moving forward as we anticipate continued growth in the procedure volumes in colorectal and thoracic surgery, areas where these products are more widely used, we would anticipate a slightly higher contribution to revenue per procedure on an organic consumption model, if you will. But it's important to remember that a variety of factors impact revenue per procedure, including the type or procedure performed, the efficiency of use and optimization, use of advanced instruments, stocking orders, timing and distributors. So there's a lot of factors here. So as a result, I&A can be lumpy, and future trends can be difficult to forecast in the end."

So for example, colorectal is probably really 4 or 5 underlying procedures that are a little bit different. And adoption goes quickly when there's large value, distinct value for the procedure relative to alternatives and when the procedure is pretty will concentrated in the hands of well-trained surgeons. So take colorectal and separate it a little bit. In the case of rectal cancer, that's a complex set of procedures. Oncologic, of course, in nature, has been growing steadily. Not a super rapid rise relative to some prior adoptions but a steady adoption for us year. And data collection has been occurring. Data publication has been occurring. And we're doing okay there. I think in other parts of colon, sometimes it's for benign, sometimes it's in oncology. Those are typically done by different surgeons. And so they adopt a look at different rates. You look at hernia again, it's subsegmented, ventral hernia versus inguinal in some segments within inguinal. So we look at it. Ventral hernia and inguinal hernia, as we define the available markets for procedures for which we bring value, have adopted pretty nicely relative to past trends.

On the first one in terms of cost reductions, it's a careful and long list of activities that goes on. So you shouldn't so much think of it as one thing as it is a routine discipline of scanning through both operating processes and manufacturing processes and parts cost and working them down as they come. You do get the first -- the greatest help on those things in the first few years of a platform release, and then after that, it starts getting increasingly hard. Suffice it to say that it isn't possible to do it. In terms of headcount growth, it's a mixture of commercial growth a little bit more weighted outside the U.S. than U.S., some manufacturing growth to cover volumes of things like instruments and accessories and other things that have been increasing as well as some design help. The headcount growth as it relates to Fosun, we're not really to break out at this time. We have certainly made headcount investment over the last few years into the technologies that have underpinned that relationship. But it's not -- I wouldn't call it out as Fosun just yet. 
With that, I'll go ahead and close the call and will catch your next quarter on the next conference call. So that was the last question.

Our company performance in the quarter was solid, with increasing customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. 
Global procedural growth was over 14% year-over-year in the quarter. Drivers of growth centered on U.S. general surgery and growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States. In the United States, year-over-year growth in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to be strong. U.S. colon resection and lung resection also contributed to solid growth. As we've stated in prior calls, we are expecting growth rates in mature procedures in the U.S. to moderate, and U.S. EBP is starting to follow this pattern, driven by the macroeconomic environment for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
In Europe, procedure growth tempered in the quarter, with some countries posting solid performance while growth softened in others. 
We're pleased with growth in procedures in Asia, with Korea and China, in particular, demonstrating continued strength. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 134 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 117 in Q3 of 2015. While we offer a range of models and price points, our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, again represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. As we've said on previous calls, capital placements are lumpy, and this quarter was no exception. 
Healthy placements stood out in the U.S., while placements in our European regions softened relative to a year ago. Capital placements in Asia are particularly unpredictable, given environment constraints like reimbursements in Japan and quotas in China. Placements in Asia were in line with prior quarters. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin dynamics. We experienced some onetime tailwinds in the quarter that contributed to higher-than-expected net income. Marshall will take you through these events and our general finances in greater detail later in the call. 
Turning to highlights of our third quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 14% over the fourth -- third quarter of last year. We shipped 134 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $683 million, up 16% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 73.1% compared to 16 -- 69.3% in the third quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $348 million, up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $478 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $308 million in the quarter, up 28% from the third quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $246 million, up 23% from Q3 of 2015. 
As we discussed with you on our last call, as our businesses strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We've been increasing these investments based on our belief that our -- that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. 
We continue to enhance features and expand access to our Xi suite of instruments, accessories and imaging products. In the third quarter, we added the ability to ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries. In addition, interoperative table motion uptake and performance is meeting our expectations. We are continuing to invest in the expansion and refinement of our base instrument, stapling and vessel sealing products for our Xi platform. 
New system platforms continue to make good progress. Our da Vinci single port is progressing in its in-house clinical evaluations and preparations for human clinical trials expected later this quarter. As we've discussed on our prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. 
SP is a platform technology that allows high-dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. Commentary by surgeons after in-house evaluations have indicated strong interest in the clinical potential of this platform. 
In the quarter, we also announced the creation of a joint venture with Fosun Pharma, owner of our current da Vinci partner in China. The JV's first objectives are to work with ISI and Fosun to produce products that address an acute need in the diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection and treatment are important. 
The technology underpinning the system is based on computer-controlled catheters, advanced image processing and sophisticated sensing. It incorporates a substantial set of proprietary intellectual property developed, owned or licensed by Intuitive over the past several years. This system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience, and final clearance and launch targets are not yet set. That said, the raw capability of the technology is compelling, and it has the potential to perform as a broader diagnostic and treatment platform over time. 
Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment. We've added approximately 400 employees year-to-date and expect increased fixed investments and some lumpiness in spending in future quarters as these platforms move through design, validation, data collection and early launch. 
As we close 2016, we have focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including new clearances, additional clinical and economic validation, training centers and the expansion of our product offerings; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll review financial highlights."
30239,402358121,1056540,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary.

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. 
We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Third quarter 2016 revenue was $683 million, an increase of 16% compared with $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter revenue of $670 million. Third quarter 2016 procedures increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. The decrease relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects seasonality. 
Revenue highlights are as follows.  Instrument and accessory revenue of $348 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflects procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,810 last quarter. The increase is relative to the third quarter of 2015 and last quarter reflects increased sales for stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2016 also reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. 
System revenue of $205 million increased 18% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts, partially offset by lower average system selling prices. 
We generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $13 million last quarter. While lease buyouts are difficult to predict, we expect the level of fourth quarter lease buyouts to be below those of the third quarter.
134 systems were placed in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 117 systems in the third quarter of 2015 and 130 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 last quarter and 13 systems in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the third quarter, there were 74 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately $4 million last quarter. We excluded the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price was $1.53 million compared with $1.61 million last year and $1.56 million last quarter. The decreases compared with prior periods primarily reflect a lower mix of dual console systems, partially offset by a lower mix of trade-in systems in the third quarter of 2016. 
Service revenue of $130 million increased 10% year-over-year and increased approximately 1% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $189 million increased 25% compared with $151 million for the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2% compared with $185 million for the second quarter. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 26% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 24%. The increase compared to the second quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 2% and recurring revenue growth of 2% in a seasonally slower quarter. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 49 systems in the third quarter compared with 37 in the third quarter of 2015 and 51 systems last quarter. 
Current quarter system sales included 18 into Europe, 2 into China 11 into Japan and 18 in the rest of world markets. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns. And sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 73.1% compared with 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015 and 71.9% for the second quarter of 2016. 
The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included $7.1 million of Medical Device Tax refunds. Without the Medical Device Tax refunds, our pro forma gross margin would have been the same as the second quarter or 72%. 
Compared with the third quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs, the Medical Device Tax refunds and manufacturing efficiencies. 
Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of system and instrument and accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the Medical Device Tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $6 million compared with last quarter. The increases reflect increased headcount, increased product development activities and investments in our OUS commercial organization. 
We added over 400 employees, primarily into product operations area, over the past year. The increase compared with the prior quarter primarily reflects increased headcount costs. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.7% compared with an effective rate of 18.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 27.8% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter of 2016 tax rate reflected $16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute limitation expirations in various jurisdictions. The third quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party.  Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and with the impact of onetime items. 
Our third quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $246 million or $6.19 per share compared with $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
Excluding onetime income tax and Medical Device Tax benefits, pro forma net income would have been $225 million or $5.65 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. 
GAAP net income was $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14%; U.S. procedures grew approximately 11%; and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 25%. 
During the first 3 quarters of 2016, global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In the United States, taken together, growth in our mature procedures slowed in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. General and thoracic procedure growth remained healthy. 
In U.S. urology, third quarter growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy slowed to low single-digit growth, a level that we believe to be similar to the overall rate of diagnoses of new prostate cancers. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter. Procedures for benign gynecologic conditions grew modestly during the third quarter, continuing a trend from the first half of the year. 
Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. 
Cholecystectomy procedures declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures being offset by declines in Single-Site procedures. Early-stage adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures is encouraging. 
Last month, at the global symposium on robotic-assisted and minimally invasive hernia repair, several new data sets comparing da Vinci to open and laparoscopic hernia repair were presented. Among the most notable presentation, Dr. Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic, presented new data on retromuscular ventral hernia repair from the American Hernia Society's Quality Collaborative or the AHSQC. 
In a prospective cohort of more than 400 patients, case match between da Vinci and open surgery, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce the length of hospitalization by 2.5 days compared to open surgery, with similar levels of wound outcomes, readmissions and reoperations. Intuitive is a founding partner of AHSQC and we are supporting its expansion to include data for inguinal hernia repair. 
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the third quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Europe and Asia was similar to the first half of the year, though procedure performance varied by country.  Strong growth continued in China, South Korea, Japan and Germany. 
While adoption of da Vinci in urology is the primary driver of procedure growth outside of the United States, we are seeing multi-specialty adoption in certain countries. In China, roughly half of the year-to-date procedure growth has come from categories outside of urology. In South Korea, approximately 60% of the year-to-date procedures have come from categories outside of urology. 
We are investing in the development of clinical evidence to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery in markets around the world. Globally, we support several evidence initiatives and registries, including AHSQC, gynecologic oncology societal registries in the U.S. and Europe, and the colorectal registry in Europe. 
In the U.S., we are also supporting several comparative prospective and retrospective multicenter studies on hernia repair, colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. Outside of the United States, we are sponsoring clinical studies in Japan to support reimbursement submissions for malignant hysterectomy and gastrectomy. In Europe, we provide support for studies in colorectal, thoracic and gynecological oncology. 
We are committed to developing local evidence in key markets to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery where our technology can bring value to hospitals, surgeons, patients. 
Third quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I've selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Dr. Dalesh [ph] and colleagues from Indiana University published a study in Surgical Endoscopy comparing da Vinci to laparoscopic colorectal procedures captured in the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Project or inscript database from 2011 through 2014. 
Including over 27,000 procedures across a range of colon and rectal resections, in exchange for an approximately 45-minute longer operative time, da Vinci low anterior resections and right colectomies showed a reduction in conversion rates. Left colectomies trended towards a reduction in conversion rates without statistical significance. Low anterior resections also showed a lower rate of sepsis with a higher rate of diverting ostomy. Across all cohorts, da Vinci surgery generated a reduction in length of hospital stay. 
The next study was published by Dr. Ozben and colleagues from the Acibadem University in Istanbul, Turkey in the General of Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy and Percutaneous Technologies. In a small case series, the authors compared their performance in performing rectal resections on da Vinci Xi to da Vinci SI. They found that da Vinci Xi was associated with an approximate 40 minutes of reduced operative time. The reduction in operative time was attributable to an elimination of double docking and hybrid surgeries in the da Vinci Xi cohort. The surgeons also found that da Vinci Xi patient population experienced an increase in lymph nodes harvested and quicker return of bowel function with a 1 day longer length of hospital stay. 
The authors concluded ""The Xi generation appeared to allow shorter console times, and its broader capabilities promise to make it a lot easier for surgeons to perform this complex robotic procedure."" 
While this study highlights the enhanced port flow capabilities of da Vinci Xi for multi-quadrant surgery such as rectal resection, our da Vinci SI installed bases remained stable in 2016 as customers continue to find value in its utilization. 
Taken together, procedures performed on da Vinci Si and Xi platforms represented over 95% of our third quarter procedures.

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015.",525,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. 
On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to forecast full year procedure growth of 14% to 15%, likely towards the higher end of the range. 
With regard to Q4 2016 system placements, we directionally expect system placements for the quarter to follow recent seasonal trends. However, we anticipate system placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of our U.S., OUS markets are in early stages of adoption and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Recall, we placed 13 systems into China and 7 systems into Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2015. As the quota in China expired in 2015 and a new quota has not yet been issued and as we are in the very early stages of adoption in Brazil, we do not expect comparables and placements into these markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Also, we believe that the flexibility we have offered customers in the form of operating leases has been well received. As a result, as compared to prior periods, we expect a higher proportion of Q4 2016 placements to be under operating leases, with revenue recognized in future periods. 
Finally, we expect to see a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous 2 quarters, given the lower number of short-term leases that are outstanding at this time. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be approximately 71.5% of net revenue. 
As Marshall indicated, the third quarter benefited from a $7.1 million Medical Device Tax refund. Excluding that benefit, our gross profit margin would have been 72%. We expect our fourth quarter margin to be directionally lower than the third quarter, primarily due to product mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will continue to accelerate. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. We are now refining this range to 13% to 14%. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015.
We expect other income to total approximately $33 million in 2016, higher than the $30 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, consistent with previous guidance, we expect our Q4 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

No, I think that what Calvin said was that the systems are seasonally stronger in Q4.

We'll, of course, give you additional detail in coming quarters. It is not currently designed as an add-on. The technology is based, as I said in the prepared remarks, on computer-controlled catheters, along with some special sensing technologies and some image analysis. Currently -- the current configuration it's in, it's a stand alone. Those types of technologies in the future could be integrated into other things, and we won't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do conceive of it as a way to access the body through natural orifices and other means, where you want to follow a prescribed pathway to get to some deep place in the body and do something. Our first clinical interest is in biopsying lung cancers or biopsying suspicious lesions in the lung. We think that, that is important globally and particularly important in China. And as a result, the partnership with Fosun, who we've known through their Chindex company for many years, made a lot of sense to us. And we're excited about it. We're not ready to give you commercial timelines yet. The technology is mature enough that we're in our initial human clinical experience.

But it occurred to me on this call that actually the Intuitive story is sort of poised for pretty significant change. I mean, I really think Intuitive has usually been about one system. I know you have multiple configurations, but in this quarter alone, Xi was still 75% of new placements. But if I think about the next 2 years, right, you're still going to have Xi and all those multiple Intuitive prior systems. You have XSP, and you're also now going to have this catheter-based sensing systems. So I wonder if you could help us understand are we right to think about this company as morphing these next 2 years? And how does supporting sort of multiple platforms now impact the addressable markets you can serve, your ability to accelerate growth and, obviously, just flat out R&D spending across these platforms?

I think -- as you think about SP, SP shares a lot in architecture and in kind of underlying technology with the Xi platform. We do think it branches us into places that are hard to reach otherwise, literally hard to reach with conventional technologies, open surgery, conventional laparoscopy or with Xi. So we think SP can broaden clinically what surgeons can do. I think that will start in niches and then will move out into broader applications as we gain clinical experience. It does increase our support load a little bit in terms of complexity, with regard to the SP, just because it's a new set of instruments and add-on accessories. But it's not an entirely new set of computational platform and things like that. As you start thinking about that catheter-based technologies, again, that's a new set of technology. So you had kind of framed it in a 2-year horizon. I would stretch that horizon out a little bit. I wouldn't anchor us there. I do think that takes us to different places. I think it allows access to parts of the body that you may not think of surgically. It may be more around diagnostics. And I think it will open up to practitioners' ways of approaching tissue that they just haven't thought about before. And that's why we're doing it. That -- you've seen us increase our R&D spend, and we've been both talking about it and doing it, and part of it has been investing in these technologies. And I think it matters. I think as people look -- as we look from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and look for opportunities to get better outcomes, we think of a variety of technologies from access technologies to imaging technologies to computational technologies that can really make a difference, and that's -- we're putting our money where our mouth is."

But some of the variables that could occur, obviously, have to do with product mix. And as you introduce new products, new products have, by their nature, lower margins than existing products. And so if there were -- as we introduce stapling, for example, we saw decline in margin initially as we improved the manufacturability and efficiency of the manufacturing process, as we see improvements in margins. So I'm not going to predict what we're going to do next year. I would just say that there are a lot of moving parts. Mix, geographically, also has an impact. Mix between systems and instruments and accessories has an impact. There's just a lot of variables that go into it.

If you look at -- prior to Q2 of 2016, our I&A revenue per procedure has been running within a really tight, narrow range, $1,830 to $1,840 per procedure. You probably recall last quarter, it actually dropped down to $1,810, and we talked about timing of orders being the main factor here. So as expected here in Q3, we saw orders rebound to offset Q2. And if you take the average of Q2 and Q3, right back at the $1,840, kind of in line with those trends over the past couple of years. As we said, though, we continue to see increasing utilization of the advanced instruments, including the stapler and vessel sealer. And moving forward, as we anticipate continued growth in the procedure volumes in colorectal and thoracic surgery, areas where these products are more widely used, we would anticipate a slightly higher contribution to revenue per procedure on an organic consumption model, if you will. But it's important to remember that a variety of factors impact revenue per procedure, including the type or procedure performed, the efficiency of use and optimization, use of advanced instruments, stocking orders, timing and distributors. So there's a lot of factors here. So as a result, I&A, it can be lumpy, and future trends can be difficult to forecast in the end."

So as we've said in the past, adoption is really per procedure, and per procedure is really segmented. So for example, colorectal is probably really 4 or 5 underlying procedures that are a little bit different. And adoption goes quickly when there's large value, distinct value for the procedure relative to alternatives and when the procedure is pretty well concentrated in the hands of well-trained surgeons. So take colorectal and separate it a little bit. In the case of rectal cancer, that's a complex set of procedures. Oncologic, of course, in nature, has been growing steadily. Not at a super rapid rise relative to some prior adoptions, but a steady adoption for us. And data collection has been occurring, data publication has been occurring, and we're doing okay there. I think in other parts of colon, sometimes it's for benign, sometimes it's oncology. Those are typically done by different surgeons. And so they adopt at little bit different rates. You look at hernia, again, it's sub-segmented, ventral hernia versus inguinal and subsegments within inguinal. So we look at it. Ventral hernia and inguinal hernia, as we define the available markets for procedures for which we bring value, have adopted pretty nicely relative to past trends.

It's not specifically to say that it isn't possible to do it.

Our company performance in the quarter was solid, with increasing customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. 
Global procedure growth was over 14% year-over-year in the quarter. Drivers of growth centered on U.S. general surgery and growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States. In the United States, year-over-year growth in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to be strong. U.S. colon resection and lung resection also contributed to solid growth. As we've stated in prior calls, we are expecting growth rates in mature procedures in the U.S. to moderate, and U.S. dVP is starting to follow this pattern, driven by the macroeconomic environment for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
In Europe, procedure growth tempered in the quarter, with some countries posting solid performance while growth softened in others. 
We're pleased with growth in procedures in Asia, with Korea and China, in particular, demonstrating continued strength. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 134 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 117 in Q3 of 2015. While we offer a range of models and price points, our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, again represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. As we've said on previous calls, capital placements are lumpy, and this quarter was no exception. 
Healthy placements stood out in the U.S., while placements in our European regions softened relative to a year ago. Capital placements in Asia are particularly unpredictable, given environment constraints like reimbursements in Japan and quotas in China. Placements in Asia were in line with prior quarters. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin dynamics. We experienced some onetime tailwinds in the quarter that contributed to higher-than-expected net income. Marshall will take you through these events and our general finances in greater detail later in the call. 
Turning to highlights of our third quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 14% over the fourth -- third quarter of last year. We shipped 134 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $683 million, up 16% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 73.1% compared to 16 -- 69.3% in the third quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $348 million, up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $478 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $308 million in the quarter, up 28% from the third quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $246 million, up 23% from Q3 of 2015. 
As we discussed with you on our last call, as our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We've been increasing these investments based on our belief that our -- that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. 
We continue to enhance features and expand access to our Xi suite of instruments, accessories and imaging products. In the third quarter, we added the ability to ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries. In addition, interoperative table motion uptake and performance is meeting our expectations. We are continuing to invest in the expansion and refinement of our base instrument, stapling and vessel sealing products for our Xi platform. 
New system platforms continue to make good progress. Our da Vinci single port is progressing in its in-house clinical evaluations and preparations for human clinical trials expected later this quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. 
SP is a platform technology that allows high-dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. Commentary by surgeons after in-house evaluations have indicated strong interest in the clinical potential of this platform. 
In the quarter, we also announced the creation of a joint venture with Fosun Pharma, owner of our current da Vinci partner in China. The JV's first objectives are to work with ISI and Fosun to produce products that address an acute need in the diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection and treatment are important. 
The technology underpinning the system is based on computer-controlled catheters, advanced image processing and sophisticated sensing. It incorporates a substantial set of proprietary intellectual property developed, owned or licensed by Intuitive over the past several years. This system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience, and final clearance and launch targets are not yet set. That said, the raw capability of the technology is compelling, and it has the potential to perform as a broader diagnostic and treatment platform over time. 
Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment. We've added approximately 400 employees year-to-date and expect increased fixed investments and some lumpiness in spending in future quarters as these platforms move through design, validation, data collection and early launch. 
As we close 2016, we have focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including new clearances, additional clinical and economic validation, training centers and the expansion of our product offerings; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll review financial highlights."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. 
We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Third quarter 2016 revenue was $683 million, an increase of 16% compared with $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter revenue of $670 million. Third quarter 2016 procedures increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. The decrease relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects seasonality. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue of $348 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflects procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,810 last quarter. The increases relative to the third quarter of 2015 and last quarter reflect increased sales for our stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2016 also reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. 
System revenue of $205 million increased 18% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts, partially offset by lower average system selling prices. 
We generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $13 million last quarter. While lease buyouts are difficult to predict, we expect the level of fourth quarter lease buyouts to be below those of the third quarter.
134 systems were placed in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 117 systems in the third quarter of 2015 and 130 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 last quarter and 13 systems in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the third quarter, there were 74 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately $4 million last quarter. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price was $1.53 million compared with $1.61 million last year and $1.56 million last quarter. The decreases compared with prior periods primarily reflect a lower mix of dual console systems, partially offset by a lower mix of trade-in systems in the third quarter of 2016. 
Service revenue of $130 million increased 10% year-over-year and increased approximately 1% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $189 million increased 25% compared with $151 million for the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2% compared with $185 million for the second quarter. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 26% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 24%. The increase compared to the second quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 2% and recurring revenue growth of 2% in a seasonally slower quarter. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 49 systems in the third quarter compared with 37 in the third quarter of 2015 and 51 systems last quarter. 
Current quarter system sales included 18 into Europe, 2 into China, 11 into Japan and 18 in the rest of world markets. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 73.1% compared with 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015 and 71.9% for the second quarter of 2016. 
The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included $7.1 million of Medical Device Tax refunds. Without the Medical Device Tax refunds, our pro forma gross margin would have been the same as the second quarter or 72%. 
Compared with the third quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs, the Medical Device Tax refunds and manufacturing efficiencies. 
Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of system and instrument and accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the Medical Device Tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $6 million compared with last quarter. The increases reflect increased headcount, increased product development activity and investments in our OUS commercial organization. 
We added over 400 employees, primarily in the product operations area, over the past year. The increase compared with the prior quarter primarily reflects increased headcount costs. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.7% compared with an effective rate of 18.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 27.8% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter of 2016 tax rate reflected $16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute of limitation expirations in various jurisdictions. The third quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and with the impact of onetime items. 
Our third quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $246 million or $6.19 per share compared with $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
Excluding onetime income tax and Medical Device Tax benefits, pro forma net income would have been $225 million or $5.65 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. 
GAAP net income was $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."
30239,402358121,1056584,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall. Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14%; U.S. procedures grew approximately 11%; and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In",993,"Thanks, Marshall. Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14%; U.S. procedures grew approximately 11%; and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 25%. 
During the first 3 quarters of 2016, global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In the United States, taken together, growth in our mature procedures slowed in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. General and thoracic procedure growth remained healthy. 
In U.S. urology, third quarter growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy slowed to low single-digit growth, a level that we believe to be similar to the overall rate of diagnoses of new prostate cancers. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the third quarter. Procedures for benign gynecologic conditions grew modestly during the third quarter, continuing a trend from the first half of the year. 
Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. 
Cholecystectomy procedures declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures being offset by declines in Single-Site procedures. Early-stage adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures is encouraging. 
Last month at the global symposium on robotic-assisted and minimally-invasive hernia repair, several new data sets comparing da Vinci to open and laparoscopic hernia repair were presented. Among the most notable presentations, Dr. Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic presented new data on retromuscular ventral hernia repair from the American Hernia Society's Quality Collaborative or the AHSQC. 
In a prospective cohort of more than 400 patients, case-matched between da Vinci and open surgery, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce the length of hospitalization by 2.5 days compared to open surgery, with similar levels of wound outcomes, readmissions and reoperations. Intuitive is a founding partner of AHSQC and we are supporting its expansion to include data for inguinal hernia repair. 
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the third quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Europe and Asia was similar to the first half of the year, though procedure performance varied by country.  Strong growth continued in China, South Korea, Japan and Germany. 
While adoption of da Vinci in urology is the primary driver of procedure growth outside of the United States, we are seeing multi-specialty adoption in certain countries. In China, roughly half of the year-to-date procedure growth has come from categories outside of urology. In South Korea, approximately 60% of the year-to-date procedures have come from categories outside of urology. 
We are investing in the development of clinical evidence to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery in markets around the world. Globally, we support several evidence initiatives and registries, including AHSQC, gynecologic oncology societal registries in the U.S. and Europe, and the colorectal registry in Europe. 
In the U.S., we are also supporting several comparative prospective and retrospective multicenter studies on hernia repair, colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. Outside of the United States, we are sponsoring clinical studies in Japan to support reimbursement submissions for malignant hysterectomy and gastrectomy. In Europe, we provide support for studies in colorectal, thoracic and gynecological oncology. 
We are committed to developing local evidence in key markets to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery where our technology can bring value to hospitals, surgeons, patients. 
Third quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I've selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Dr. Dalesh [ph] and colleagues from Indiana University published a study in Surgical Endoscopy comparing da Vinci to laparoscopic colorectal procedures captured in the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Project or NSQIP database from 2011 through 2014. 
Including over 27,000 procedures across a range of colon and rectal resections, in exchange for an approximate 45-minute longer operative time, da Vinci low anterior resections and right colectomies showed a reduction in conversion rates. Left colectomies trended towards a reduction in conversion rates without statistical significance. Low anterior resections also showed a lower rate of sepsis with a higher rate of diverting ostomy. Across all cohorts, da Vinci surgery generated a reduction in length of hospital stay. 
The next study was published by Dr. Ozben and colleagues from the Acibadem University in Istanbul, Turkey in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy and Percutaneous Technologies. In a small case series, the authors compared their performance in performing rectal resections on da Vinci Xi to da Vinci Si. They found that da Vinci Xi was associated with an approximate 40 minutes of reduced operative time. The reduction in operative time was attributable to an elimination of double docking and hybrid surgeries in the da Vinci Xi cohort. The surgeons also found the da Vinci Xi patient population experienced an increase in lymph nodes harvested and quicker return of bowel function with a 1 day longer length of hospital stay. 
The authors concluded ""The Xi generation appeared to allow shorter console times, and its broader capabilities promise to make it a lot easier for surgeons to perform this complex robotic procedure."" 
While this study highlights the enhanced workflow capabilities of da Vinci Xi for multi-quadrant surgery such as rectal resection, our da Vinci Si installed base has remained stable in 2016 as customers continue to find value in its utilization. 
Taken together, procedures performed on da Vinci Si and Xi platforms represented over 95% of our third quarter procedures. 
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015.",526,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. 
On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to forecast full year procedure growth of 14% to 15%, likely towards the higher end of the range. 
With regard to Q4 2016 system placements, we directionally expect system placements for the quarter to follow recent seasonal trends. However, we anticipate system placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of our U.S. -- OUS markets are in early stages of adoption and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Recall, we placed 13 systems into China and 7 systems into Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2015. As the quota in China expired in 2015 and a new quota has not yet been issued and as we are in the very early stages of adoption in Brazil, we do not expect comparables and placements into these markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Also, we believe that the flexibility we have offered customers in the form of operating leases has been well received. As a result, as compared to prior periods, we expect a higher proportion of Q4 2016 placements to be under operating leases, with revenue recognized in future periods. 
Finally, we expect to see a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous 2 quarters, given the lower number of short-term leases that are outstanding at this time. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be approximately 71.5% of net revenue. 
As Marshall indicated, the third quarter benefited from a $7.1 million Medical Device Tax refund. Excluding that benefit, our gross profit margin would have been 72%. We expect our fourth quarter margin to be directionally lower than the third quarter, primarily due to product mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will continue to accelerate. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. We are now refining this range to 13% to 14%. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015.
We expect other income to total approximately $33 million in 2016, higher than the $30 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, consistent with previous guidance, we expect our Q4 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

We do conceive of it as a way to access the body through natural orifices and other means, where you want to follow a prescribed pathway to get to some deep place in the body and do something. Our first clinical interest is in biopsying lung cancers or biopsying suspicious lesions in the lung. We think that, that is important globally and particularly important in China.

But if I think about the next 2 years, right, you're still going to have Xi and all those multiple Intuitive prior systems. You have XSP, and you're also now going to have this catheter-based sensing system.

We do think it branches us into places that are hard to reach otherwise, literally hard to reach with conventional technologies, open surgery, conventional laparoscopy or with Xi. So we think SP can broaden clinically what surgeons can do. I think that will start in niches and then we'll move out into broader applications as we gain clinical experience. It does increase our support load a little bit in terms of complexity with regard to the SP, just because it's a new set of instruments and add-on accessories. But it's not an entirely new set of computational platform and things like that. As you start thinking about the catheter-based technologies, again, that's a new set of technologies. You had kind of framed it in a 2-year horizon. I would stretch that horizon out a little bit. I wouldn't anchor us there. I do think that takes us to different places. I think it allows access to parts of the body that you may not think of surgically. It may be more around diagnostics. And I think it will open up to practitioners' ways of approaching tissue that they just haven't thought about before. And that's why we're doing it. That -- you've seen us increase our R&D spend, and we've been both talking about it and doing it, and part of it has been investing in these technologies. And I think it matters. I think as people look -- as we look from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head and look for opportunities to get better outcomes, we think of a variety of technologies from access technologies to imaging technologies to computational technologies that can really make a difference, and that's -- we're putting our money where our mouth is."

Obviously, margins this year is a huge part of the story and they have been, frankly, kind of extraordinary. So as you head into '17, just in light of the spending comments you've made, I don't think it's realistic for investors to expect 200 basis points of margin expansion in '17. Based on your comments on spending and what you're going to have to do to support these platforms, I mean, how should we sort of calibrate our thinking next year between sort of an extraordinary 2016 expansion and a more moderate 2015 margin expansion? Should we be thinking about something between those 2 poles as more appropriate than what we are seeing this year, which seems very outsized?"

But some of the variables that could occur, obviously have to do with product mix. And as you introduce new products, new products have, by their nature, lower margins than existing products. And so if there were -- as we introduced stapling, for example, we saw a decline in margin initially. As we improved the manufacturability and efficiency of the manufacturing processes, we've seen improvements in margins. So I'm not going to predict what we're going to do next year. I would just say that there are a lot of moving parts. Mix, geographically, also has an impact. Mix between systems and instruments and accessories has an impact. There's just a lot of variables that go into it. I think what you've seen this last year, though, is outstanding performance by our manufacturing group to reduce the cost of newer products that were lower margin a year ago."

As we said, though, we continue to see increasing utilization of the advanced instruments, including the stapler and vessel sealer. And moving forward, as we anticipate continued growth in the procedure volumes in colorectal and thoracic surgery, areas where these products are more widely used, we would anticipate a slightly higher contribution to revenue per procedure on an organic consumption model, if you will. But it's important to remember that a variety of factors impact revenue per procedure, including the type or procedure performed, the efficiency of use and optimization, use of advanced instruments, stocking orders, timing and distributors.

Yes. They tend to develop in time. The underlying catheter-based technologies that we're talking about now, as you know, having followed us for some time, were really first acquired by us years ago. So the answer to that is yes. We're out looking. Fosun has been a good partner. They have both a relationship with us through Chindex, but they also understand the healthcare space extremely well in multiple dimensions. And so the short answer to that is we've been doing it and expect to continue to do it."

So as we've said in the past, adoption is really per procedure, and per procedure is really segmented. So for example, colorectal is probably really 4 or 5 underlying procedures that are a little bit different. And adoption goes quickly when there's large value, distinct value for the procedure relative to alternatives and when the procedure is pretty well concentrated in the hands of well-trained surgeons. So take colorectal and separate it a little bit. In the case of rectal cancer, that's a complex set of procedures. Oncologic, of course, in nature, has been growing steadily. Not a super rapid rise relative to some prior adoptions, but a steady adoption for us. And data collection has been occurring, data publication has been occurring, and we're doing okay there. I think in other parts of colon, sometimes it's for benign, sometimes it's oncology. Those are typically done by different surgeons. And so they adopt at little bit different rates. You look at hernia, again, it's sub-segmented, ventral hernia versus inguinal and subsegments within inguinal. So we look at it. Ventral hernia and inguinal hernia, as we define the available markets for procedures for which we bring value, have adopting pretty nicely relative to past trends. Rectal has been on a slower adoption but a steady one, and colon is in the middle."

On the first one, in terms of cost reductions, it's a careful and long list of activities that goes on. So you shouldn't so much think of it as one thing as it is a routine discipline of scanning through both operating processes and manufacturing processes and parts costs and working them down as they come. You do get the first -- the greatest help on those things in the first few years of a platform release. And then after that, it starts getting increasingly hard. It's not specifically to say that it isn't possible to do it. In terms of headcount growth, it's a mixture of commercial growth, a little bit more weighted outside the U.S. than U.S., some manufacturing growth to cover volumes of things like instruments and accessories and other things that have been increasing as well as some design help. The headcount growth, as it relates to Fosun, we're not really to break out at this time. We have certainly made headcount investments over the last few years into the technologies that have underpinned that relationship. But it's not -- I wouldn't call it out as Fosun just yet.

Our company performance in the quarter was solid, with increasing customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. 
Global procedure growth was over 14% year-over-year in the quarter. Drivers of growth centered on U.S. general surgery and growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States. In the United States, year-over-year growth in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to be strong. U.S. colon resection and lung resection also contributed to solid growth. As we've stated in prior calls, we are expecting growth rates in mature procedures in the U.S. to moderate, and U.S. dVP is starting to follow this pattern, driven by the macroeconomic environment for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
In Europe, procedure growth tempered in the quarter, with some countries posting solid performance while growth softened in others. 
We're pleased with growth in procedures in Asia, with Korea and China, in particular, demonstrating continued strength. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 134 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 117 in Q3 of 2015. While we offer a range of models and price points, our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, again represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. As we've said on previous calls, capital placements are lumpy, and this quarter was no exception. 
Healthy placements stood out in the U.S., while placements in our European regions softened relative to a year ago. Capital placements in Asia are particularly unpredictable, given environment constraints like reimbursements in Japan and quotas in China. Placements in Asia were in line with prior quarters. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin dynamics. We experienced some onetime tailwinds in the quarter that contributed to higher-than-expected net income. Marshall will take you through these events and our general finances in greater detail later in the call. 
Turning to highlights of our third quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 14% over the fourth -- third quarter of last year. We shipped 134 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $683 million, up 16% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 73.1% compared to 16 -- 69.3% in the third quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $348 million, up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $478 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $308 million in the quarter, up 28% from the third quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $246 million, up 23% from Q3 of 2015. 
As we discussed with you on our last call, as our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We've been increasing these investments based on our belief that our -- that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. 
We continue to enhance features and expand access to our Xi suite of instruments, accessories and imaging products. In the third quarter, we added the ability to ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries. In addition, interoperative table motion uptake and performance is meeting our expectations. We are continuing to invest in the expansion and refinement of our base instrument, stapling and vessel sealing products for our Xi platform. 
New system platforms continue to make good progress. Our da Vinci single port is progressing in its in-house clinical evaluations and preparations for human clinical trials expected later this quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. 
SP is a platform technology that allows high-dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. Commentary by surgeons after in-house evaluations have indicated strong interest in the clinical potential of this platform. 
In the quarter, we also announced the creation of a joint venture with Fosun Pharma, owner of our current da Vinci partner in China. The JV's first objectives are to work with ISI and Fosun to produce products that address an acute need in the diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection and treatment are important. 
The technology underpinning the system is based on computer-controlled catheters, advanced image processing and sophisticated sensing. It incorporates a substantial set of proprietary intellectual property developed, owned or licensed by Intuitive over the past several years. This system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience, and final clearance and launch targets are not yet set. That said, the raw capability of the technology is compelling, and it has the potential to perform as a broader diagnostic and treatment platform over time. 
Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment. We've added approximately 400 employees year-to-date and expect increased fixed investments and some lumpiness in spending in future quarters as these platforms move through design, validation, data collection and early launch. 
As we close 2016, we have focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including new clearances, additional clinical and economic validation, training centers and the expansion of our product offerings; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll review financial highlights."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. 
We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Third quarter 2016 revenue was $683 million, an increase of 16% compared with $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter revenue of $670 million. Third quarter 2016 procedures increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. The decrease relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects seasonality. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue of $348 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflects procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,810 last quarter. The increases relative to the third quarter of 2015 and last quarter reflect increased sales for our stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2016 also reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. 
System revenue of $205 million increased 18% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts, partially offset by lower average system selling prices. 
We generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $13 million last quarter. While lease buyouts are difficult to predict, we expect the level of fourth quarter lease buyouts to be below those of the third quarter.
134 systems were placed in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 117 systems in the third quarter of 2015 and 130 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 last quarter and 13 systems in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the third quarter, there were 74 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately $4 million last quarter. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price was $1.53 million compared with $1.61 million last year and $1.56 million last quarter. The decreases compared with prior periods primarily reflect a lower mix of dual console systems, partially offset by a lower mix of trade-in systems in the third quarter of 2016. 
Service revenue of $130 million increased 10% year-over-year and increased approximately 1% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $189 million increased 25% compared with $151 million for the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2% compared with $185 million for the second quarter. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 26% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 24%. The increase compared to the second quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 2% and recurring revenue growth of 2% in a seasonally slower quarter. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 49 systems in the third quarter compared with 37 in the third quarter of 2015 and 51 systems last quarter. 
Current quarter system sales included 18 into Europe, 2 into China, 11 into Japan and 18 in the rest of world markets. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 73.1% compared with 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015 and 71.9% for the second quarter of 2016. 
The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included $7.1 million of Medical Device Tax refunds. Without the Medical Device Tax refunds, our pro forma gross margin would have been the same as the second quarter or 72%. 
Compared with the third quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs, the Medical Device Tax refunds and manufacturing efficiencies. 
Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of system and instrument and accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the Medical Device Tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $6 million compared with last quarter. The increases reflect increased headcount, increased product development activity and investments in our OUS commercial organization. 
We added over 400 employees, primarily in the product operations area, over the past year. The increase compared with the prior quarter primarily reflects increased headcount costs. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.7% compared with an effective rate of 18.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 27.8% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter of 2016 tax rate reflected $16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute of limitation expirations in various jurisdictions. The third quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and with the impact of onetime items. 
Our third quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $246 million or $6.19 per share compared with $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
Excluding onetime income tax and Medical Device Tax benefits, pro forma net income would have been $225 million or $5.65 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. 
GAAP net income was $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."

Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14%; U.S. procedures grew approximately 11%; and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 25%. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In",993,"Thanks, Marshall. Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14%; U.S. procedures grew approximately 11%; and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 25%. 
During the first 3 quarters of 2016, global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In the United States, taken together, growth in our mature procedures slowed in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. General and thoracic procedure growth remained healthy. 
In U.S. urology, third quarter growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy slowed to low single-digit growth, a level that we believe to be similar to the overall rate of diagnoses of new prostate cancers. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the third quarter. Procedures for benign gynecologic conditions grew modestly during the third quarter, continuing a trend from the first half of the year. 
Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. 
Cholecystectomy procedures declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures being offset by declines in Single-Site procedures. Early-stage adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures is encouraging. 
Last month at the global symposium on robotic-assisted and minimally-invasive hernia repair, several new data sets comparing da Vinci to open and laparoscopic hernia repair were presented. Among the most notable presentations, Dr. Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic presented new data on retromuscular ventral hernia repair from the American Hernia Society's Quality Collaborative or the AHSQC. 
In a prospective cohort of more than 400 patients, case-matched between da Vinci and open surgery, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce the length of hospitalization by 2.5 days compared to open surgery, with similar levels of wound outcomes, readmissions and reoperations. Intuitive is a founding partner of AHSQC and we are supporting its expansion to include data for inguinal hernia repair. 
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the third quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Europe and Asia was similar to the first half of the year, though procedure performance varied by country.  Strong growth continued in China, South Korea, Japan and Germany. 
While adoption of da Vinci in urology is the primary driver of procedure growth outside of the United States, we are seeing multi-specialty adoption in certain countries. In China, roughly half of the year-to-date procedure growth has come from categories outside of urology. In South Korea, approximately 60% of the year-to-date procedures have come from categories outside of urology. 
We are investing in the development of clinical evidence to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery in markets around the world. Globally, we support several evidence initiatives and registries, including AHSQC, gynecologic oncology societal registries in the U.S. and Europe, and the colorectal registry in Europe. 
In the U.S., we are also supporting several comparative prospective and retrospective multicenter studies on hernia repair, colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. Outside of the United States, we are sponsoring clinical studies in Japan to support reimbursement submissions for malignant hysterectomy and gastrectomy. In Europe, we provide support for studies in colorectal, thoracic and gynecological oncology. 
We are committed to developing local evidence in key markets to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery where our technology can bring value to hospitals, surgeons, patients. 
Third quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I've selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Dr. Dalesh [ph] and colleagues from Indiana University published a study in Surgical Endoscopy comparing da Vinci to laparoscopic colorectal procedures captured in the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Project or NSQIP database from 2011 through 2014. 
Including over 27,000 procedures across a range of colon and rectal resections, in exchange for an approximate 45-minute longer operative time, da Vinci low anterior resections and right colectomies showed a reduction in conversion rates. Left colectomies trended towards a reduction in conversion rates without statistical significance. Low anterior resections also showed a lower rate of sepsis with a higher rate of diverting ostomy. Across all cohorts, da Vinci surgery generated a reduction in length of hospital stay. 
The next study was published by Dr. Ozben and colleagues from the Acibadem University in Istanbul, Turkey in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy and Percutaneous Technologies. In a small case series, the authors compared their performance in performing rectal resections on da Vinci Xi to da Vinci Si. They found that da Vinci Xi was associated with an approximate 40 minutes of reduced operative time. The reduction in operative time was attributable to an elimination of double docking and hybrid surgeries in the da Vinci Xi cohort. The surgeons also found the da Vinci Xi patient population experienced an increase in lymph nodes harvested and quicker return of bowel function with a 1 day longer length of hospital stay. 
The authors concluded ""The Xi generation appeared to allow shorter console times, and its broader capabilities promise to make it a lot easier for surgeons to perform this complex robotic procedure."" 
While this study highlights the enhanced workflow capabilities of da Vinci Xi for multi-quadrant surgery such as rectal resection, our da Vinci Si installed base has remained stable in 2016 as customers continue to find value in its utilization. 
Taken together, procedures performed on da Vinci Si and Xi platforms represented over 95% of our third quarter procedures. 
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015.",526,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. 
On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to forecast full year procedure growth of 14% to 15%, likely towards the higher end of the range. 
With regard to Q4 2016 system placements, we directionally expect system placements for the quarter to follow recent seasonal trends. However, we anticipate system placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of our U.S. -- OUS markets are in early stages of adoption and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Recall, we placed 13 systems into China and 7 systems into Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2015. As the quota in China expired in 2015 and a new quota has not yet been issued and as we are in the very early stages of adoption in Brazil, we do not expect comparables and placements into these markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Also, we believe that the flexibility we have offered customers in the form of operating leases has been well received. As a result, as compared to prior periods, we expect a higher proportion of Q4 2016 placements to be under operating leases, with revenue recognized in future periods. 
Finally, we expect to see a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous 2 quarters, given the lower number of short-term leases that are outstanding at this time. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be approximately 71.5% of net revenue. 
As Marshall indicated, the third quarter benefited from a $7.1 million Medical Device Tax refund. Excluding that benefit, our gross profit margin would have been 72%. We expect our fourth quarter margin to be directionally lower than the third quarter, primarily due to product mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will continue to accelerate. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. We are now refining this range to 13% to 14%. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015.
We expect other income to total approximately $33 million in 2016, higher than the $30 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, consistent with previous guidance, we expect our Q4 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

We'll, of course, give you additional detail in coming quarters. It is not currently designed as an add-on. The technology is based, as I said in the prepared remarks, on computer-controlled catheters, along with some special sensing technologies and some image analysis. Currently -- the current configuration it's in, it's a stand-alone. Those types of technologies in the future could be integrated into other things, and we won't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do conceive of it as a way to access the body through natural orifices and other means, where you want to follow a prescribed pathway to get to some deep place in the body and do something. Our first clinical interest is in biopsying lung cancers or biopsying suspicious lesions in the lung. We think that, that is important globally and particularly important in China. And as a result, the partnership with Fosun, who we've known through their Chindex company for many years, made a lot of sense to us. And we're excited about it.

I think -- as you think about SP, SP shares a lot in architecture and in kind of underlying technology with the Xi platform. We do think it branches us into places that are hard to reach otherwise, literally hard to reach with conventional technologies, open surgery, conventional laparoscopy or with Xi. So we think SP can broaden clinically what surgeons can do. I think that will start in niches and then we'll move out into broader applications as we gain clinical experience. It does increase our support load a little bit in terms of complexity with regard to the SP, just because it's a new set of instruments and add-on accessories. But it's not an entirely new set of computational platform and things like that. As you start thinking about the catheter-based technologies, again, that's a new set of technologies. You had kind of framed it in a 2-year horizon. I would stretch that horizon out a little bit. I wouldn't anchor us there. I do think that takes us to different places. I think it allows access to parts of the body that you may not think of surgically. It may be more around diagnostics. And I think it will open up to practitioners' ways of approaching tissue that they just haven't thought about before. And that's why we're doing it. That -- you've seen us increase our R&D spend, and we've been both talking about it and doing it, and part of it has been investing in these technologies. And I think it matters.

As we improved the manufacturability and efficiency of the manufacturing processes, we've seen improvements in margins. So I'm not going to predict what we're going to do next year. I would just say that there are a lot of moving parts. Mix, geographically, also has an impact. Mix between systems and instruments and accessories has an impact.

You probably recall last quarter, it actually dropped down to $1,810, and we talked about timing of orders being the main factor here. So as expected here in Q3, we saw orders rebound to offset Q2. And if you take the average of Q2 and Q3, you're right back at the $1,840, kind of in line with those trends over the past couple of years. As we said, though, we continue to see increasing utilization of the advanced instruments, including the stapler and vessel sealer. And moving forward, as we anticipate continued growth in the procedure volumes in colorectal and thoracic surgery, areas where these products are more widely used, we would anticipate a slightly higher contribution to revenue per procedure on an organic consumption model, if you will. But it's important to remember that a variety of factors impact revenue per procedure, including the type or procedure performed, the efficiency of use and optimization, use of advanced instruments, stocking orders, timing and distributors. So there's a lot of factors here. So as a result, I&A, it can be lumpy, and future trends can be difficult to forecast in the end."

So for example, colorectal is probably really 4 or 5 underlying procedures that are a little bit different. And adoption goes quickly when there's large value, distinct value for the procedure relative to alternatives and when the procedure is pretty well concentrated in the hands of well-trained surgeons. So take colorectal and separate it a little bit. In the case of rectal cancer, that's a complex set of procedures. Oncologic, of course, in nature, has been growing steadily. Not a super rapid rise relative to some prior adoptions, but a steady adoption for us. And data collection has been occurring, data publication has been occurring, and we're doing okay there. I think in other parts of colon, sometimes it's for benign, sometimes it's oncology. Those are typically done by different surgeons. And so they adopt at little bit different rates. You look at hernia, again, it's sub-segmented, ventral hernia versus inguinal and subsegments within inguinal. So we look at it.

I think that technique refinement and data generation is what the next round of surgeons rely upon to evaluate. And so we're seeing that kind of transition right now, really in both of those hernia domains."

On the first one, in terms of cost reductions, it's a careful and long list of activities that goes on. So you shouldn't so much think of it as one thing as it is a routine discipline of scanning through both operating processes and manufacturing processes and parts costs and working them down as they come. You do get the first -- the greatest help on those things in the first few years of a platform release. And then after that, it starts getting increasingly hard. It's not specifically to say that it isn't possible to do it. In terms of headcount growth, it's a mixture of commercial growth, a little bit more weighted outside the U.S. than U.S., some manufacturing growth to cover volumes of things like instruments and accessories and other things that have been increasing as well as some design help. The headcount growth, as it relates to Fosun, we're not really to break out at this time. We have certainly made headcount investments over the last few years into the technologies that have underpinned that relationship. But it's not -- I wouldn't call it out as Fosun just yet. 
With that, I'll go ahead and close the call. And then we'll catch your next question on the next conference call. That was the last question. 
As we've said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We've built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months."

Our company performance in the quarter was solid, with increasing customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. 
Global procedure growth was over 14% year-over-year in the quarter. Drivers of growth centered on U.S. general surgery and growth in the use of da Vinci Surgical Systems outside the United States. In the United States, year-over-year growth in ventral and inguinal hernia repair continues to be strong. U.S. colon resection and lung resection also contributed to solid growth. As we've stated in prior calls, we are expecting growth rates in mature procedures in the U.S. to moderate, and U.S. dVP is starting to follow this pattern, driven by the macroeconomic environment for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
In Europe, procedure growth tempered in the quarter, with some countries posting solid performance while growth softened in others. 
We're pleased with growth in procedures in Asia, with Korea and China, in particular, demonstrating continued strength. Patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call. 
We placed 134 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 117 in Q3 of 2015. While we offer a range of models and price points, our most capable model, da Vinci Xi, again represented roughly 3/4 of new capital placements. As we've said on previous calls, capital placements are lumpy, and this quarter was no exception. 
Healthy placements stood out in the U.S., while placements in our European regions softened relative to a year ago. Capital placements in Asia are particularly unpredictable, given environment constraints like reimbursements in Japan and quotas in China. Placements in Asia were in line with prior quarters. 
Turning to revenue and gross margin dynamics. We experienced some onetime tailwinds in the quarter that contributed to higher-than-expected net income. Marshall will take you through these events and our general finances in greater detail later in the call. 
Turning to highlights of our third quarter operating results. Procedures grew approximately 14% over the fourth -- third quarter of last year. We shipped 134 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $683 million, up 16% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit margin was 73.1% compared to 16 -- 69.3% in the third quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $348 million, up 17%. Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $478 million, representing 70% of total revenue. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $308 million in the quarter, up 28% from the third quarter of last year. And pro forma net income was $246 million, up 23% from Q3 of 2015. 
As we discussed with you on our last call, as our business has strengthened, we have increased our mid- and long-term investments in creating our next generation of products and services. We've been increasing these investments based on our belief that our -- that substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally. 
We continue to enhance features and expand access to our Xi suite of instruments, accessories and imaging products. In the third quarter, we added the ability to ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries. In addition, interoperative table motion uptake and performance is meeting our expectations. We are continuing to invest in the expansion and refinement of our base instrument, stapling and vessel sealing products for our Xi platform. 
New system platforms continue to make good progress. Our da Vinci single port is progressing in its in-house clinical evaluations and preparations for human clinical trials expected later this quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we plan first markets to include head and neck surgery, urology and colorectal surgery. 
SP is a platform technology that allows high-dexterity access with great 3D vision to confined surgical spaces. Commentary by surgeons after in-house evaluations have indicated strong interest in the clinical potential of this platform. 
In the quarter, we also announced the creation of a joint venture with Fosun Pharma, owner of our current da Vinci partner in China. The JV's first objectives are to work with ISI and Fosun to produce products that address an acute need in the diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world and for which early detection and treatment are important. 
The technology underpinning the system is based on computer-controlled catheters, advanced image processing and sophisticated sensing. It incorporates a substantial set of proprietary intellectual property developed, owned or licensed by Intuitive over the past several years. This system is in its early stages of our human clinical experience, and final clearance and launch targets are not yet set. That said, the raw capability of the technology is compelling, and it has the potential to perform as a broader diagnostic and treatment platform over time. 
Bringing new platforms to the market represents a significant investment. We've added approximately 400 employees year-to-date and expect increased fixed investments and some lumpiness in spending in future quarters as these platforms move through design, validation, data collection and early launch. 
As we close 2016, we have focused on the following: first, expanding the use of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair; second, advancing our ecosystem, including new clearances, additional clinical and economic validation, training centers and the expansion of our product offerings; third, driving our organizational capabilities in markets in Europe and Asia; and finally, assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who'll review financial highlights."

I'll be describing our results on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased IP. 
We provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website so that there's no confusion. 
Third quarter 2016 revenue was $683 million, an increase of 16% compared with $590 million for the third quarter of 2015 and an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter revenue of $670 million. Third quarter 2016 procedures increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and decreased 1% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. The decrease relative to the prior quarter primarily reflects seasonality. 
Revenue highlights are as follows: Instrument and accessory revenue of $348 million increased 17% compared with last year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. Growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflects procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. 
Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,870 per procedure compared with $1,840 last year and $1,810 last quarter. The increases relative to the third quarter of 2015 and last quarter reflect increased sales for our stapling and vessel sealing products. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2016 also reflects the impact of customer buying patterns. 
System revenue of $205 million increased 18% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect higher system placements and higher revenue associated with lease buyouts, partially offset by lower average system selling prices. 
We generated approximately $13 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $3 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $13 million last quarter. While lease buyouts are difficult to predict, we expect the level of fourth quarter lease buyouts to be below those of the third quarter.
134 systems were placed in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 117 systems in the third quarter of 2015 and 130 systems last quarter. 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with 15 last quarter and 13 systems in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease. 
As of the end of the third quarter, there were 74 systems out in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and approximately $4 million last quarter. We exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system ASP calculations. 
Globally, our average system price was $1.53 million compared with $1.61 million last year and $1.56 million last quarter. The decreases compared with prior periods primarily reflect a lower mix of dual console systems, partially offset by a lower mix of trade-in systems in the third quarter of 2016. 
Service revenue of $130 million increased 10% year-over-year and increased approximately 1% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems. 
Outside of the U.S., results were as follows: Third quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $189 million increased 25% compared with $151 million for the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2% compared with $185 million for the second quarter. The increase compared with the previous year is comprised of a 26% growth in recurring revenue, which is driven by procedure growth of 25% and increased systems revenue of 24%. The increase compared to the second quarter reflects systems revenue growth of 2% and recurring revenue growth of 2% in a seasonally slower quarter. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 49 systems in the third quarter compared with 37 in the third quarter of 2015 and 51 systems last quarter. 
Current quarter system sales included 18 into Europe, 2 into China, 11 into Japan and 18 in the rest of world markets. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption. Some markets are highly seasonal, reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulation.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 73.1% compared with 69.3% for the third quarter of 2015 and 71.9% for the second quarter of 2016. 
The pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2016 included $7.1 million of Medical Device Tax refunds. Without the Medical Device Tax refunds, our pro forma gross margin would have been the same as the second quarter or 72%. 
Compared with the third quarter of 2015, the higher gross margin reflects reduced product costs, the Medical Device Tax refunds and manufacturing efficiencies. 
Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of system and instrument and accessory revenue, costs associated with our scope exchange program, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and, in the long term, the potential reinstatement of the Medical Device Tax. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $6 million compared with last quarter. The increases reflect increased headcount, increased product development activity and investments in our OUS commercial organization. 
We added over 400 employees, primarily in the product operations area, over the past year. The increase compared with the prior quarter primarily reflects increased headcount costs. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.7% compared with an effective rate of 18.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 27.8% last quarter. The pro forma third quarter of 2016 tax rate reflected $16 million of tax benefits or $0.40 per share realized as a result of the statute of limitation expirations in various jurisdictions. The third quarter of 2015 tax rate reflected $29 million or $0.77 per share related to a favorable tax court ruling involving an independent third party. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of OUS and U.S. income and with the impact of onetime items. 
Our third quarter 2016 pro forma net income was $246 million or $6.19 per share compared with $199 million or $5.24 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $220 million or $5.62 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
Excluding onetime income tax and Medical Device Tax benefits, pro forma net income would have been $225 million or $5.65 per share.
As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. 
GAAP net income was $211 million or $5.31 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $167 million or $4.40 per share for the third quarter of 2015 and $185 million or $4.71 per share for the second quarter of 2016. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. As our cash builds, we will continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick, who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights."
30239,402358121,1361493,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marshall.

Of our third quarter procedure growth of 14%; U.S. procedures grew approximately 11%; and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 25%. 
During the first 3 quarters of 2016, global procedure growth was nearly 16%. In the United States, taken together, growth in our mature procedures slowed in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. General and thoracic procedure growth remained healthy. 
In U.S. urology, third quarter growth in da Vinci Prostatectomy slowed to low single-digit growth, a level that we believe to be similar to the overall rate of diagnoses of new prostate cancers. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. 
In U.S. gynecology, third quarter procedures grew modestly year-over-year, with growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy. Continuing the recent trend, we estimate a larger proportion of da Vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the third quarter. Procedures for benign gynecologic conditions grew modestly during the third quarter, continuing a trend from the first half of the year. 
Third quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery, and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. 
Cholecystectomy procedures declined in the quarter, with growth in multi-port procedures being offset by declines in Single-Site procedures. Early-stage adoption of lobectomies and other thoracic procedures is encouraging. 
Last month at the global symposium on robotic-assisted and minimally-invasive hernia repair, several new data sets comparing da Vinci to open and laparoscopic hernia repair were presented. Among the most notable presentations, Dr. Rosen from the Cleveland Clinic presented new data on retromuscular ventral hernia repair from the American Hernia Society's Quality Collaborative or the AHSQC. 
In a prospective cohort of more than 400 patients, case-matched between da Vinci and open surgery, da Vinci surgery was shown to reduce the length of hospitalization by 2.5 days compared to open surgery, with similar levels of wound outcomes, readmissions and reoperations. Intuitive is a founding partner of AHSQC and we are supporting its expansion to include data for inguinal hernia repair. 
Turning abroad. Procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 25% in the third quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci Prostatectomy, with solid contributions from kidney procedures. Total procedure growth in Europe and Asia was similar to the first half of the year, though procedure performance varied by country.  Strong growth continued in China, South Korea, Japan and Germany. 
While adoption of da Vinci in urology is the primary driver of procedure growth outside of the United States, we are seeing multi-specialty adoption in certain countries. In China, roughly half of the year-to-date procedure growth has come from categories outside of urology. In South Korea, approximately 60% of the year-to-date procedures have come from categories outside of urology. 
We are investing in the development of clinical evidence to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery in markets around the world. Globally, we support several evidence initiatives and registries, including AHSQC, gynecologic oncology societal registries in the U.S. and Europe, and the colorectal registry in Europe. 
In the U.S., we are also supporting several comparative prospective and retrospective multicenter studies on hernia repair, colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. Outside of the United States, we are sponsoring clinical studies in Japan to support reimbursement submissions for malignant hysterectomy and gastrectomy. In Europe, we provide support for studies in colorectal, thoracic and gynecological oncology. 
We are committed to developing local evidence in key markets to support the adoption of da Vinci surgery where our technology can bring value to hospitals, surgeons, patients. 
Third quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I've selected a few studies that you may find interesting. Dr. Dalesh [ph] and colleagues from Indiana University published a study in Surgical Endoscopy comparing da Vinci to laparoscopic colorectal procedures captured in the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Project or NSQIP database from 2011 through 2014. 
Including over 27,000 procedures across a range of colon and rectal resections, in exchange for an approximate 45-minute longer operative time, da Vinci low anterior resections and right colectomies showed a reduction in conversion rates. Left colectomies trended towards a reduction in conversion rates without statistical significance. Low anterior resections also showed a lower rate of sepsis with a higher rate of diverting ostomy. Across all cohorts, da Vinci surgery generated a reduction in length of hospital stay. 
The next study was published by Dr. Ozben and colleagues from the Acibadem University in Istanbul, Turkey in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy and Percutaneous Technologies. In a small case series, the authors compared their performance in performing rectal resections on da Vinci Xi to da Vinci Si. They found that da Vinci Xi was associated with an approximate 40 minutes of reduced operative time. The reduction in operative time was attributable to an elimination of double docking and hybrid surgeries in the da Vinci Xi cohort. The surgeons also found the da Vinci Xi patient population experienced an increase in lymph nodes harvested and quicker return of bowel function with a 1 day longer length of hospital stay. 
The authors concluded ""The Xi generation appeared to allow shorter console times, and its broader capabilities promise to make it a lot easier for surgeons to perform this complex robotic procedure."" 
While this study highlights the enhanced workflow capabilities of da Vinci Xi for multi-quadrant surgery such as rectal resection, our da Vinci Si installed base has remained stable in 2016 as customers continue to find value in its utilization. 
Taken together, procedures performed on da Vinci Si and Xi platforms represented over 95% of our third quarter procedures. 
This concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin."

I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015.",526,"Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2016, starting with procedures. 
On our last call, we estimated full year 2016 procedure growth of 14% to 15% above the approximately 652,000 procedures performed in 2015. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to forecast full year procedure growth of 14% to 15%, likely towards the higher end of the range. 
With regard to Q4 2016 system placements, we directionally expect system placements for the quarter to follow recent seasonal trends. However, we anticipate system placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy as some of our U.S. -- OUS markets are in early stages of adoption and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations. 
Recall, we placed 13 systems into China and 7 systems into Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2015. As the quota in China expired in 2015 and a new quota has not yet been issued and as we are in the very early stages of adoption in Brazil, we do not expect comparables and placements into these markets in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Also, we believe that the flexibility we have offered customers in the form of operating leases has been well received. As a result, as compared to prior periods, we expect a higher proportion of Q4 2016 placements to be under operating leases, with revenue recognized in future periods. 
Finally, we expect to see a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous 2 quarters, given the lower number of short-term leases that are outstanding at this time. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full year 2016 pro forma gross profit margin to be approximately 71.5% of net revenue. 
As Marshall indicated, the third quarter benefited from a $7.1 million Medical Device Tax refund. Excluding that benefit, our gross profit margin would have been 72%. We expect our fourth quarter margin to be directionally lower than the third quarter, primarily due to product mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. Based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business, we expect expense growth will continue to accelerate. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2016 operating expenses to grow between 12% and 15% above 2015 levels. We are now refining this range to 13% to 14%. 
Consistent with our last call, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $170 million and $180 million in 2016 compared to $168 million in 2015.
We expect other income to total approximately $33 million in 2016, higher than the $30 million forecast on our last call, due primarily to higher interest income. 
With regard to income tax, consistent with previous guidance, we expect our Q4 2016 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5% and 28.5% of pretax income, depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

We'll, of course, give you additional detail in coming quarters. It is not currently designed as an add-on. The technology is based, as I said in the prepared remarks, on computer-controlled catheters, along with some special sensing technologies and some image analysis. Currently -- the current configuration it's in, it's a stand-alone. Those types of technologies in the future could be integrated into other things, and we won't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do conceive of it as a way to access the body through natural orifices and other means, where you want to follow a prescribed pathway to get to some deep place in the body and do something. Our first clinical interest is in biopsying lung cancers or biopsying suspicious lesions in the lung. We think that, that is important globally and particularly important in China. And as a result, the partnership with Fosun, who we've known through their Chindex company for many years, made a lot of sense to us. And we're excited about it.

I know you have multiple configurations, but in this quarter alone, Xi was still 75% of new placements. But if I think about the next 2 years, right, you're still going to have Xi and all those multiple Intuitive prior systems. You have XSP, and you're also now going to have this catheter-based sensing system. So I wonder if you could help us understand are we right to think about this company as morphing these next 2 years?

So we think SP can broaden clinically what surgeons can do. I think that will start in niches and then we'll move out into broader applications as we gain clinical experience. It does increase our support load a little bit in terms of complexity with regard to the SP, just because it's a new set of instruments and add-on accessories. But it's not an entirely new set of computational platform and things like that. As you start thinking about the catheter-based technologies, again, that's a new set of technologies. You had kind of framed it in a 2-year horizon. I would stretch that horizon out a little bit. I wouldn't anchor us there. I do think that takes us to different places. I think it allows access to parts of the body that you may not think of surgically. It may be more around diagnostics. And I think it will open up to practitioners' ways of approaching tissue that they just haven't thought about before. And that's why we're doing it. That -- you've seen us increase our R&D spend, and we've been both talking about it and doing it, and part of it has been investing in these technologies. And I think it matters.

As we improved the manufacturability and efficiency of the manufacturing processes, we've seen improvements in margins. So I'm not going to predict what we're going to do next year. I would just say that there are a lot of moving parts. Mix, geographically, also has an impact. Mix between systems and instruments and accessories has an impact.

And if you take the average of Q2 and Q3, you're right back at the $1,840, kind of in line with those trends over the past couple of years. As we said, though, we continue to see increasing utilization of the advanced instruments, including the stapler and vessel sealer. And moving forward, as we anticipate continued growth in the procedure volumes in colorectal and thoracic surgery, areas where these products are more widely used, we would anticipate a slightly higher contribution to revenue per procedure on an organic consumption model, if you will. But it's important to remember that a variety of factors impact revenue per procedure, including the type or procedure performed, the efficiency of use and optimization, use of advanced instruments, stocking orders, timing and distributors.

So as we've said in the past, adoption is really per procedure, and per procedure is really segmented. So for example, colorectal is probably really 4 or 5 underlying procedures that are a little bit different. And adoption goes quickly when there's large value, distinct value for the procedure relative to alternatives and when the procedure is pretty well concentrated in the hands of well-trained surgeons. So take colorectal and separate it a little bit. In the case of rectal cancer, that's a complex set of procedures. Oncologic, of course, in nature, has been growing steadily. Not a super rapid rise relative to some prior adoptions, but a steady adoption for us. And data collection has been occurring, data publication has been occurring, and we're doing okay there. I think in other parts of colon, sometimes it's for benign, sometimes it's oncology. Those are typically done by different surgeons. And so they adopt at little bit different rates. You look at hernia, again, it's sub-segmented, ventral hernia versus inguinal and subsegments within inguinal. So we look at it. Ventral hernia and inguinal hernia, as we define the available markets for procedures for which we bring value, have adopting pretty nicely relative to past trends. Rectal has been on a slower adoption but a steady one, and colon is in the middle."

You do get the first -- the greatest help on those things in the first few years of a platform release. And then after that, it starts getting increasingly hard. It's not specifically to say that it isn't possible to do it. In terms of headcount growth, it's a mixture of commercial growth, a little bit more weighted outside the U.S. than U.S., some manufacturing growth to cover volumes of things like instruments and accessories and other things that have been increasing as well as some design help. The headcount growth, as it relates to Fosun, we're not really to break out at this time.
