Good morning and thank all of you for joining us today. With me today are Craig Owen, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Sherrick, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Business Development; Paul Geiger, Senior Vice President of our Southwest Appalachia assets; and Michael Hancock, our Director of Investor Relations. 
If you've not received a copy of last night's 2 press releases regarding our fourth quarter 2015 financial and operating results, along with our 2016 initiatives and plan, you can find a copy of those in our website at swn.com. I'd also like to point out that many of the comments during this teleconference are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties affecting outcomes, many of which are beyond our control and are discussed in more detail in the risk factors and the forward-looking statement sections of our annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results or developments may differ materially.
Now let's begin. In the 4 years that I have the privilege of being part of this great company, our teams have accomplished a great deal. Southwestern Energy clearly has premier assets, disciplined capital investment, a low-cost operating model, a highly talented workforce and a strategy built upon our formula and inspired by our core values. I truly believe in the opportunities we have in front of us and the future success of our company. 
And although I know the company well, after moving into my current role last month, I thought it's important to take a stop and take a fresh look. And having done that, I'm confident that our strategy is an enduring one. And today I want to share with you several priorities as we move forward. I believe that credibility is derived from consistently delivering on commitments made and as such, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying assets, which is a core part of the SWN formula will drive our decisions on investment activity when prices are high and when they are not. The industry is facing tremendous challenges, especially related to commodity prices. Inspired by our formula, we've taken clear and decisive actions to respond to these near-term challenges and strengthen the bridge to value adding growth in the future. 
To achieve this we are focused on building our strong liquidity to further strengthen the balance sheet, to invest it in cash flow, driving further operating efficiencies, enhancing margins and optimizing the portfolio. 
Starting first with liquidity, Southwestern Energy's liquidity position is strong with $1.9 billion of undrawn capacity on our $2 billion unsecured revolver at the end of 2015. Withdrawing on that liquidity to invest in wells that have margin economics in today's price environment does not make sense to us. We will continue to watch prices as we get further into the year and we can adjust accordingly. Craig will go into more detail of our liquidity and our financials in just a few minutes. 
Another foundational aspect of our company is that future cash flows generated from our currently producing wells and our Midstream assets more than exceeds our total debt obligations for the company due to our large high-quality asset base and cash flows for Midstream. Strengthening the balance sheet is a key priority for us in 2016. We did not plan to add to debt and are actively pursuing a number of options to reduce our debt levels. Additionally, we have previously disclosed we have taken decisive steps including idling our company-owned drilling rigs and frac fleets, as we're committed to invest within cash flow based on strip pricing in 2016. We are reviewing options for potential asset sales and as we make tangible progress and have decisions in this area, we will share them with you. 
We are driving further operating efficiency, we have taken further steps to improve our margin by removing costs resulting from reduced activity and lower ongoing -- lowering our ongoing cost structure. As a result of this decreased activity, in January, we announced a workforce reduction with deep personal regret that impacted 40% of our SWN team. When we look at commodity prices at our current plans, there just wasn't enough activity to support that size of employee base. 
Also announced yesterday we have recently finalized a new agreement that reduces the gathering transportation and processing rates in our Southwest Appalachia acreage. This provides 2 major benefits for us: First, it significantly lowers the gathering rates of our existing production in this important growth assets; and second, it provides a highly competitive dry gas gathering solution for the core of our West Virginia acreage, creating an additional optionality to allocate capital to wet gas or dry gas locations, including our Utica potential as commodity prices dictate. 
These 2 actions alone have reduced our ongoing annual cost structure by more than $200 million. On the top line, we are unlocking additional value from existing wells through a series of changes we are making to drilling completions and operating practices. The results are encouraging and our teams are working across the company to unlock additional value. 
Let me turn to Craig for a moment to discuss some of our financial guidelines. Followed by Paul Geiger who will discuss some of our operational highlights and our exciting first year of our ownership of our Southwest Appalachia asset."

As Bill mentioned, Southwestern and the industry is facing challenges in this commodity price environment. While these challenges are substantial and requires action, we have taken significant amount of liquidity",362,"Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. As Bill mentioned, Southwestern and the industry is facing challenges in this commodity price environment. While these challenges are substantial and requires action, we have taken significant amount of liquidity with our $2 billion unsecured revolver that does not mature until late 2018. Southwestern and much of the industry have also experienced recent credit rating downgrades by the rating agencies and expanding credit metrics as a result of this environment. We are working to address these issues on a number of fronts. However, these actions and metrics have had no impact on our unsecured revolver or other debt instruments other than a minimal increase in our expected 2016 cash interest costs at our year end 2015 debt balances. 
And assuming those year end 2015 debt balances, total cash interest cost across all of our debt instruments will increase as a result of these downgrades by about $30 million on an annual basis beginning in 2017 and will begin to cutting again in 2018. The substantial liquidity position and active balance sheet management differentiates Southwestern from others. And when combined with our strong portfolio of assets, positions Southwestern well for a strong future. 
Additionally, and to emphasize a point that Bill made, these existing assets provide a substantial cash flow stream that at current commodity price forecast not only services our debt but pays it off over time. From a capital investment perspective in 2015, we began exhibiting our flexibility and modified our activities to align with the current environment as we move throughout the year. Importantly, we adjusted our capital investments down to $1.8 billion. This is a reduction of 30% from our original capital guidance of $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year and $50 million below our most recent public guidance. With this reduction, we're still able to deliver record production volumes of 976 Bcfe, a 27% increase over 2014, 9% of which was organic growth. And this growth reflect our significant operating achievements across the portfolio, despite depressed commodity price environment. 
I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our first year of operations in our Southwest Appalachia business."

Our first year of operations with the assets in Southwest Appalachia was an outstanding one from an operational perspective. We had efficiently integrated the Southwest Appalachia into SWN during 2015. We leveraged the many learnings and successes from our entry into Northeast Appalachia and Pennsylvania and was again demonstrated our ability to ramp quickly and produce impressive operating results in a short period of time. 
Our Southwest Appalachia asset has exceeded our expectations in every operational aspect as compared to our acquisition model. The genes hit the ground running delivering top quartile of drilling and completion efficiencies, a full 2 years ahead of expectations. Not only cost-efficient, this high quality execution resulted in an over 94% success rate of placing the drilled laterals some as low as 12,000 feet within our targeted 12-foot thick interval of the Marcellus. This exceptional performance combined with much higher sand concentration in our completions resulted in well performance that ranges from 30% to 100% better than the wells drilled by the previous operator on the same path. 
One outstanding pad development is our -- of this program is our [indiscernible] in the Central Panhandle. We were able to drill and complete 4 additional wells in this pad, placing 98% of the 43,000 feet of drilled lateral in our 12-foot target within the Marcellus interval. Initial production from the 9 total wells on this pad was over 900 cubic feet equipment per day, over half of which was liquids. 
In total, this initial year of drilling ramped production from these assets by over 65%, demonstrating the potential of this position. These factors have also increased our expectations of our core Panhandle acreage by over 50% on a per acre basis as compared to our acquisition. 
Over 200,000 of our 425,000 acres are in this core of the core from Marcellus and Utica development. Over 60% of which is held by production and over 80% of which has no obligation until 2018 or later. We accomplished a lot in our first year with this asset and we are not standing still. We are working to identify additional ways to improve returns as we continue development of this premium acreage position within a world-class producing basin. 
Across the company, 2015 included record drilling results, record well performance, material well cost savings and terrific results from our base production enhancement efforts. This performance had allowed us to build an even stronger base as we begin 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Bill for additional comments on 2016."

As we close the books on 2015, I want to turn forward and look at 2016. And as I mentioned earlier, our strategy will be one that focuses on rigorous financial discipline and unlocking additional value. With our commitment to investing within cash flow, we issued guidance yesterday afternoon as you know that included the minimal amount of new activity. We are committed to investing only in projects that meet or exceed our 1.3 PVI hurdle and in this environment that can return the cash flow from investment in this year. We are prepared for a prolonged low price environment but we remain equipped with the flexibility and liquidity to ramp activity quickly when prices improve. With this planned activity, production is expected to decline. And while this is different from our typical E&P operational plan, we are in very different times from a commodity price perspective and we believe this is the prudent path to take for now. 
Having said this, as prices recover, we have the ability to ramp up and increase activity quickly and capture the value that is associated with those improved prices. We have the core DNA in each area of our operation that will allow us to pivot from our current activity level to evaluating growth as market fundamentals normalize. 
So I want to stop here with my remarks so we can get back to the operator who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

Currently, there's a lot of conditions that can change between now and then. The simple fact that our production is declining from a company as large as ours is itself a market signal. I think when I look at 2017 and 2018, we've got various scenarios on how we might progress. But I want to see first how the rest of this year at least the early part of this year plays out. If you look at our current portfolio, every $0.25 [ph] movement in gas, adds $100 million of cash flow to our bottom line. And with our mandate to invest it in cash flow as we see prices improve, one of the opportunities for us is to get back into and restart our drilling and completions. We would certainly prioritize our work to wells that are currently drilled but not completed and then prioritize across the company in terms of the highest PVI projects. And how that exactly would work, I think what we want to do is let 2016 play a little longer. I carefully used the word idled my rigs. I didn't shut them down and take that away and get rid of them. We've had the capability to restart fairly quickly. If you look at where we would invest, certainly the economics in the Northeast tend to be the strongest economics we have. And as we have demonstrated by our well performance over the last couple of years, it takes far fewer rigs to drill and complete wells that have growing production than our original plans. So the number of rigs, the number of wells, that we are continuing the work and we'll talk more about that as we move forward."

But I think the Constitution Pipeline is really caught up in some issues related to the State of New York more than just in general because I think the State of Pennsylvania is ready to move on that. We have a portion of that pipeline in our portfolio. We've always planned to be -- our earliest plan 2, 3 years ago was far to come at the end of this year. So we basically managed around it so that we're pretty flexible. At the end of the day, when I get done, I think if the people of New York want to capitalize on the great value that natural gas brings to heating, I think we will speak up at that project to move ahead. When you look at the Southwest Appalachia area, it's a bit of different dynamic. It seems much liquid market, there's a lot more opportunities and a lot more projects moving into the area and they seem to be moving at pace. I mean we've got to listen to work together with the stakeholders but from what we understand, these projects are moving along from the perspective of getting approvals and getting all those. The certainly in the market as it unfolds going forward and pricing will also help dictate the pace of those but you've got projects that are proposed that span the next 5 or 4 years and they all seem to, at this point be lining up to be exactly where we need them to be."

In fact, we spend a lot of time of redrilling wells in paper to see how what I thought was going to happen happen and what it can do to change. The technology and the tools that are able to enable us to steer wells much closer to the drillbit than we ever have before, often times are used offshore technologies, enable those tools should be readily available for us in a lower commodity -- lower-cost environment on shoring shale. And so we've got the ability to steer and we've got the ability to see where we want to steer so lateral placement becomes so much more important. And as Paul said earlier, we can actually steer one of the 12,000-foot laterals. I believe we stayed in a 12-foot zone for 100% of the time with the tools that we have. If you can stay in that zone and you can get that lateral drilled then the completion techniques that we're using especially around sand loading to improve the near wellbore quality of the frac become significant. And the third thing, and Paul mentioned this as well, around the the content of liquids to gas and these pads is just like the old days of Haynesville, but for different reasons, managing the draw down on these reservoirs significantly improves or have the effects the outcome of the liquid content that is coming out of these wells. And so those techniques plus some of the work that we've done across the company and other areas around timing of beginning to flow wells in terms of debottlenecking the infrastructure that is both downhole and on the surface have really impacted performance across our company and we continue to share those techniques in each of the areas. We've made a lot of these major strides when we moved into Pennsylvania, 5 years ago, 6 years ago and the effects were significant. We took that team and moved it over to West Virginia and that team replicated that terrific [indiscernible] results in that."

But what I can say is at $3, we still have a couple of thousand of wells in inventory that we can -- that meet our hurdle and we can certainly go drill. And as the price comes off that, you have a full slate of wells that you can drill across the company and it gets back to that management and cash flow circuit breaker that we've imposed on ourselves to make sure that we're not going past that. Obviously, the Fayetteville Shale is more sensitive to gas prices. And as you go through so you can have $3.50, you can have 5,000 well locations and in its current prices today that number dropped significantly. In fact, I don't have economic wells to drill in this 10 seconds and what is now the third lowest March strip since we began tracking all of this. So you do have there's a lot of swing there. When you move to the Northeast, certainly the Northeast Pennsylvania is less sensitive but you still see a change drop off that you've got 1,300 wells or so in the inventory when prices get down, that number may drop down by half. Southwest Appalachia has 2 different kind of aspects to it. One is we have dry gas, we have wet gas, then the dry gas is even further subdivided into Marcellus and Utica. So as we work through the economics and certainly and the big deal is this gathering deal that you just finished with Williams, which expanded the pipe for both of us and is a win-win for both of us and is enabling our economic threshold of a big chunk of that acreage improve. So you've got that dynamic as well. We finished our first Utica well and when the first drilling goes, we don't need to or plan to complete it at this time because it's actually not in an area where our pipeline is built yet. So our rigorous attention to the margin is certainly there. But we know that, that area is far less sensitive to some of these changes in gas price and inventory means. So we've always been a low cost operator, we will drive even further to get our structural cost to change and bring it down along with these techniques that we've been talking about on improving the revenue side. In other words, the performance side of these wells and I think we'll continue to move ourselves along those curves as well."

And as I've mentioned in my opening comments, the northern part of our acreage is where we've also captured a gathering solution with Williams to gather that gas. And so as we begin the process of looking at how we want to lay that out now that we have that agreement in place, you can build that infrastructure out fairly quickly again given the economics, driven by priority but you can build that infrastructure pretty quickly and begin to look. Our next few wells in the area of the Utica we are planning in the north and that was because the dry gas infrastructure is present around those and we can move them in. If you then take a look at the wells that are being drilled and completed all around us, those wells are proving up our position and we are delighted with the success that our colleagues and the industry are having and it just reinforces the quality of the acreage that we have. And as soon as we can in the priority of investing with the cash flow and where they fit in the priority stack, we will begin getting down that path. I would remind everyone that when we did the acquisition, our plans were to do to begin the process of drilling the Utica in 2018 and so the well that we drilled in this last year advanced that by 2 years and we still see a lot of opportunities in that area. It's just a matter of prioritization at this point. And just to make some further clarity on the completion of the well that we did drill, we were going to point that in the wet gas system, it was a test in that part of our area and wanted to do that we've got worked out an arrangement to be able to do that. But honestly when you're putting a dry gas well into wet gas system, you need to take an impairment on economics. And so will just way to compute that well.

Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With me today, I've got Craig Owen, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Sherrick, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Business Development; Paul Geiger, Senior Vice President of our Southwest Appalachia assets; and Michael Hancock, our Director of Investor Relations. 
If you've not received a copy of last night's 2 press releases regarding our fourth quarter 2015 financial and operating results, along with our 2016 initiatives and plan, you can find a copy of those on our website at swn.com. 
I'd also like to point out that many of the comments during this teleconference are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties affecting outcomes, many of which are beyond our control and are discussed in more detail in the risk factors and the forward-looking statement section of our annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results or developments may differ materially.
Now let's begin. In the 4 years that I had the privilege of being part of this great company, our teams have accomplished a great deal. Southwestern Energy clearly has premier assets, disciplined capital investment, a low-cost operating model, a highly talented workforce and a strategy built upon our formula and inspired by our core values. I truly believe in the opportunities we have in front of us and the future success of our company. 
And although I know the company well, after moving into my current role last month, I thought it important to take stock and take a fresh look. And having done that, I'm confident that our strategy is an enduring one. And today, I want to share with you several priorities as we move forward. I believe that credibility is derived from consistently delivering on commitments made. And as such, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying assets, which is a core part of the SWN formula, will drive our decisions on investment activity when prices are high and when they are not. 
The industry is facing tremendous challenges, especially related to commodity prices. Inspired by our formula, we've taken clear and decisive actions to respond to these near-term challenges and strengthen the bridge to value-adding growth in the future. To achieve this, we are focused on building on -- our strong liquidity to further strengthen the balance sheet, to invest it in cash flow, driving further operating efficiencies, enhancing margins and optimizing the portfolio. 
Starting first with liquidity, Southwestern Energy's liquidity position is strong with $1.9 billion of undrawn capacity on our $2 billion unsecured revolver at the end of 2015. Withdrawing on that liquidity to invest in wells that have marginal economics in today's price environment does not make sense to us. We will continue to watch prices as we get further into the year and we can adjust accordingly. Craig will go into more detail of our liquidity and our financials in just a few minutes. 
Another foundational aspect of our company is that future cash flows, generated from our currently producing wells and our Midstream assets, more than exceeds our total debt obligations for the company due to our large high-quality asset base and cash flows for Midstream. Strengthening the balance sheet is a key priority for us in 2016. We do not plan to add to debt and are actively pursuing a number of options to reduce our debt levels. Additionally, we have previously disclosed we have taken decisive steps, including idling our company-owned drilling rigs and frac fleets, as we are committed to invest within cash flow based on strip pricing in 2016. We are reviewing options for potential asset sales and as we make tangible progress and have decisions in this area, we will share them with you. 
We're driving further operating efficiency, we have taken further steps to improve our margin by removing costs, resulting from reduced activity, and lower ongoing -- lowering our ongoing cost structure. As a result of this decreased activity, in January, we announced a workforce reduction with deep personal regret that impacted 40% of our SWN team. When we look at commodity prices and our current plans, there just wasn't enough activity to support that size of employee base. 
Also announced yesterday, we have recently finalized a new agreement that reduces the gathering, transportation and processing rates in our Southwest Appalachia acreage. This provides 2 major benefits for us: first, it significantly lowers the gathering rates of our existing production in this important growth asset; and second, it provides a highly competitive dry gas gathering solution for the core of our West Virginia acreage, creating an additional optionality to allocate capital to wet gas or dry gas locations, including our Utica potential as commodity prices dictate. 
These 2 actions alone have reduced our ongoing annual cost structure by more than $200 million. On the top line, we are unlocking additional value from existing wells through a series of changes we are making to drilling, completions and operating practices. The results are encouraging and our teams are working across the company to unlock additional value. 
Let me turn to Craig for a moment to discuss some of our financial highlights, followed by Paul Geiger, who will discuss some of their -- our operational highlights and the exciting first year of our ownership of our Southwest Appalachia asset."

As Bill mentioned, Southwestern and the industry are facing challenges in this commodity price environment. While these challenges are substantial and require action, we have a significant amount of liquidity with our $2 billion unsecured revolver that does not mature until late 2018. Southwestern and much of the industry have also experienced recent credit rating downgrades by the rating agencies and expanding credit metrics as a result of this environment. We are working to address these issues on a number of fronts. However, these actions and metrics have had no impact on our unsecured revolver or other debt instruments other than a minimal increase in our expected 2016 cash interest costs at our year end 2015 debt balances. 
And assuming those year end 2015 debt balances, total cash interest cost across all of our debt instruments will increase as a result of these downgrades by about $30 million on an annual basis beginning in 2017 and will begin declining again in 2018. Our substantial liquidity position and active balance sheet management differentiates Southwestern from others. And when combined with our strong portfolio of assets, positions Southwestern well for a strong future. 
Additionally, and to emphasize a point that Bill made, these existing assets provide a substantial cash flow stream that at current commodity price forecast, not only services our debt, but pays it off over time. From a capital investment perspective, in 2015, we began exhibiting our flexibility and modified our activities to align with the current environment as we move throughout the year. Importantly, we adjusted our capital investments down to $1.8 billion. This is a reduction of 30% from our original capital guidance of $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year and $50 million below our most recent public guidance. With this reduction, we are still able to deliver record production volumes of 976 Bcfe, a 27% increase over 2014, 9% of which was organic growth. And this growth reflects our significant operating achievements across the portfolio, despite the depressed commodity price environment. 
I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our first year of operations in our Southwest Appalachia business."

Our first year of operations with the assets in Southwest Appalachia was an outstanding one from an operational perspective. We efficiently integrated the Southwest Appalachia asset into SWN during 2015. We leveraged the many learnings and successes from our entry into Northeast Appalachia in Pennsylvania and once again demonstrated our ability to ramp quickly and produce impressive operating results in a short period of time. 
Our Southwest Appalachia asset has exceeded our expectations in every operational aspect as compared to our acquisition model. The teams hit the ground running, delivering top quartile of drilling and completion efficiencies, a full 2 years ahead of expectations. Not only cost-efficient, this high-quality execution resulted in an over 94% success rate of placing the drilled laterals, some as long as 12,000 feet, within our targeted 12-foot thick interval of the Marcellus. This exceptional performance combined with much higher sand concentration in our completions resulted in well performance that ranges from 30% to 100% better than the wells drilled by the previous operator on the same pad. 
One outstanding pad development is our -- of this program is our [indiscernible] in the Central Panhandle. We were able to drill and complete 4 additional wells on this pad, placing 98% of the 43,000 feet of drilled lateral in our 12-foot target within the Marcellus interval. Initial production from the 9 total wells on this pad was over 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day, over half of which was liquids. 
In total, this initial year of drilling ramped production from these assets by over 65%, demonstrating the potential of this position. These factors have also increased our expectations of our core Panhandle acreage by over 50% on a per acre basis as compared to our acquisition. 
Over 200,000 of our 425,000 acres are in this core of the core for Marcellus and Utica development. Over 60% of which is held by production and over 80% of which has no obligation until 2018 or later. We accomplished a lot in our first year with this asset and we are not standing still. We are working to identify additional ways to improve returns as we continue development of this premium acreage position within a world-class producing basin. 
Across the company, 2015 included record drilling results, record well performance, material well cost savings and terrific results from our base production enhancement efforts. This performance has allowed us to build an even stronger base as we begin 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Bill for additional comments on 2016."

As we close the books on 2015, I want to turn forward and look at 2016. And as I mentioned earlier, our strategy will be one that focuses on rigorous financial discipline and unlocking additional value. With our commitment to investing within cash flow, we issued guidance yesterday afternoon, as you know, that included a minimal amount of new activity. We are committed to investing only in projects that meet or exceed our 1.3 PVI hurdle and in this environment that can return their cash flow from divestment in this year. We are prepared for a prolonged low price environment, but we remain equipped with the flexibility and liquidity to ramp activity quickly when prices improve. With this planned activity, production is expected to decline. And while this is different from our typical E&P operational plan, we are very different -- we're in very different times from a commodity price perspective, and we believe this is the prudent path to take for now. 
Having said this, as prices recover, we have the ability to ramp up and increase activity quickly and capture the value that is associated with those improved prices. We have the core DNA in each area of our operation that will allow us to pivot from our current activity level to evaluating growth as market fundamentals normalize. 
So I want to stop here with my remarks so we can get back to the operator and -- who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

The simple fact that our production is declining from a company as large as ours is, in itself, a market signal. I think when I look at 2017 and 2018, we've got various scenarios on how we might progress, but I want to see first how the rest of this year, at least the early part of this year plays out. If you look at our current portfolio, every $0.20 -- $0.25 movement in gas, adds $200 million in cash flow to our bottom line. And with our mandate to invest within cash flow, as we see prices improve, one of the opportunities for us is to get back into and restart our drilling and completions. We would certainly prioritize our work to wells that are currently drilled but not completed, and then prioritize across the company in terms of the highest PVI projects. And how that exactly would work, I think what we want to do is let 2016 play out a little longer. I carefully used the words, ""idled my rigs."" I didn't shut them down and take -- or take them away and get rid of them. We have the capability to restart fairly quickly. If you look at where we would invest, certainly the economics in the Northeast tend to be the strongest economics we have. And as we have demonstrated just by our well performance over the last couple of years, it takes far fewer rigs to drill and complete wells that have growing production than our original plan. So the number of rigs, the number of wells, all of that, we are continuing the work and we'll talk more about that as we move forward."

We work very hard to work in areas where we operate and live within, minimizing our footprint. But I think the Constitution Pipeline is really caught up in some issues related to the State of New York more than just in general because I think the State of Pennsylvania is ready to move on that. We have a portion of that pipeline in our portfolio. We've always planned to be -- our earliest plan 2 or 3 years ago was for it to come on the end of this year. So we basically managed around it so that we're pretty flexible. At the end of the day, will it get done? I think if the people of New York want to capitalize on the great value the natural gas brings to heating, I think they will speak up and that project will move ahead. When you look at the Southwest Appalachia area, it's a bit of different dynamic. It seems there's -- it's a much more liquid market. There's a lot more opportunities and a lot more projects moving into the area and they seem to be moving at pace. I mean, we've got to listen to the various stakeholders, we've got to work together with the stakeholders, but from what we understand, those projects are moving along from the perspective of getting approvals and gaining all those. But certainly the market as it unfolds going forward and pricing will also help dictate the pace of those. But you've got projects that are proposed, that span in the next 5 or 4 years and they all seem to, at this point, be lining up to be exactly where we need them to be."

In fact, we spend a lot of time redrilling wells on paper to see how what we thought was going to happen and what we can do to change. The technology and the tools that are able to enable us to steer wells much closer to the drill bit than we ever had before that often times are used offshore. Technologies enable those tools to be readily available for us in a lower commodity -- lower-cost environment onshoring shale. And so we've got the ability to steer and we've got the ability to see where we want to steer, so lateral placement becomes so much more important. And as Paul said earlier, we can actually steer -- and one of the 12,000-foot laterals, I believe we stayed in a 12-foot zone for 100% of the time with the tools that we have. If you can stay in that zone and you can get that lateral drilled, then the completion techniques that we're using, especially around sand loading to improve the near wellbore quality of the frac become significant. And the third thing, and Paul mentioned this as well, around the content of liquids to gas on these pads is just like the old days of Haynesville, but for different reasons, managing the drawdown on these reservoirs significantly improves or affects the outcome of the liquid content that is coming out of these wells. And so those techniques plus some of the work that we've done across the company and other areas around timing of beginning-to-flow wells in terms of debottlenecking the infrastructure that is both downhole and on the surface have really impacted the performance across our company and we continue to share that -- those techniques in each of the areas. We made a lot of these major strides when we moved into Pennsylvania, about 5 years ago, 6 years ago, and the effects were significant. When we took that team and moved them over to West Virginia, and that team replicated that terrific -- those terrific results in there."

But what I can say is that $3, our -- we still have a couple thousand wells in inventory that we can -- that meet our hurdle and that we can certainly go drill. And as the price comes off that, you have a full slate of wells that you can drill across the company and it gets back to that management and cash flow circuit breaker that we had imposed on ourselves to make sure that we're not going past that. Obviously, the Fayetteville Shale is more sensitive to gas prices. And as you go through, so you can have -- at $3.50, you can have 5,000 well locations and at current prices today, that number drops significantly. In fact, we don't have economic wells to drill in this 10 seconds and what is now the third lowest March strip since we began tracking all of this. So you do have -- there's a lot of swing there. When you move to the Northeast, certainly in Northeast Pennsylvania, it's less sensitive but you still see a change dropoff if you've got 1,300 wells or so in the inventory. When prices get down, that number may drop down by half. Southwest Appalachia has 2 different kind of aspects to it. One is we have dry gas, we have wet gas, and the dry gas is even further subdivided into Marcellus and Utica. So as we work through the economics and certainly and a big deal is this gathering deal that we just finished with Williams, which expanded the pipe for both of us and is a win-win for both of us and is enabling our -- the economic threshold of a -- big chunk of that acreage to improve. So you've got that dynamic as well. We finished our first Utica well and when we -- as far as drilling goes, we don't need to or plan to complete it at this time because it's actually not in an area where our pipeline is built yet. And so our rigorous attention to margin is certainly there. But we know that, that area is far less sensitive to some of these changes in gas price and then inventory remains. So we've always been a low-cost operator, we will drive even further to get our structural cost to change and bring it down, along with these techniques that we've been talking about on improving the revenue side. In other words, the performance side of these wells and I think we'll continue to move ourselves along those curves as well."

I guess, your comment was we're not going to compete it at this point, but the area appears to be less sensitive on gas prices. What, in your opinion, is your plan at this point with the dry gas at Utica? It feels like it's an area you can monetize or in fact, develop as your most economic asset if it works out.

And as I've mentioned in my opening comments, the northern part of our acreage is where we've also captured a gathering solution with Williams to gather that gas. And so as we begin to -- the process of looking at how we want to lay that out now that we have that agreement in place, you can build that infrastructure out fairly quickly, again, driven by economics, driven by priority, but you can build that infrastructure out pretty quickly and then begin to look. Our next few wells in the area of the Utica were planned in the north and that was because the dry gas infrastructure is present around us and we can move them in. If you take a look at the wells that are being drilled and completed all around us, those wells are proving up our position and we're delighted with the success that our colleagues in the industry are having and it just reinforces the quality of the acreage that we have. And as soon as we can in the priority of investing with the cash flow and where they fit in the priority stack, we will begin going down that path. I would remind everyone that when we did the acquisition, our plans were to do -- to begin the process of drilling the Utica in 2018. And so the well that we drilled in this last year advanced that by 2 years and we still see a lot of opportunities in that area. It's just a matter of prioritization at this point. And just to make some further clarity on the completion of the well that we did drill, we were going to put that into a wet gas system. It was a test in that part of our area and we wanted to do. We've got -- we have worked out arrangements to be able to do that, but obviously when you're putting a dry gas well into wet gas system, you need to take an impairment on economics. And so we'll just wait to complete that well. We'll go if we get and -- if and when we get to the Utica North."

We're going to optimize the business and continue to drive for every dollar we can in that area and then really position ourselves to return evaluating growth when the environment improves. But before we kind of conclude, I want to emphasize the passion we have to deliver on these strategic priorities and to win in this environment is really beyond -- is unwavering. That is probably the best way I can put that. I firmly believe that our strong liquidity position, our premier portfolio of assets, investing within cash flow as a mandate that we've imposed on ourselves, our capital discipline of investing only in projects that exceed our 1.3 PVI hurdle, our aggressive drive on margin improvement, and really probably the most important part, our team of extraordinary people across the company will really enable us to execute the plan and allow us to forge ahead in these times and also create additional long-term value for our shareholders. 
In my experience, times like these, challenging times are often when the industry delivers the brightest ideas that take us to the next level. And I can tell you, we plan to be a big part of that future and a big part of unlocking ideas and value from our curiosity and learning here at Southwestern. 
So I want to thank you for joining the call. I look forward to meeting with you -- meeting the new faces that are on the call, and thank those that have been on the call previously for being here, and you all have a great weekend."

With me today, I've got Craig Owen, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Sherrick, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Business Development; Paul Geiger, Senior Vice President of our Southwest Appalachia assets; and Michael Hancock, our Director of Investor Relations. 
If you've not received a copy of last night's 2 press releases regarding our fourth quarter 2015 financial and operating results, along with our 2016 initiatives and plan, you can find a copy of those on our website at swn.com. 
I'd also like to point out that many of the comments during this teleconference are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties affecting outcomes, many of which are beyond our control and are discussed in more detail in the risk factors and the forward-looking statements section of our annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results or developments may differ materially.
Now let's begin. In the 4 years that I've had the privilege of being part of this great company, our teams have accomplished a great deal. Southwestern Energy clearly has premier assets, disciplined capital investment, a low-cost operating model, a highly talented workforce and a strategy built upon our formula and inspired by our core values. I truly believe in the opportunities we have in front of us and the future success of our company. 
And although I know the company well, after moving into my current role last month, I thought it important to take stock and take a fresh look. And having done that, I'm confident that our strategy is an enduring one. And today, I want to share with you several priorities as we move forward. I believe that credibility is derived from consistently delivering on commitments made. And as such, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying assets, which is a core part of the SWN formula, will drive our decisions on investment activity when prices are high and when they are not. 
The industry is facing tremendous challenges, especially related to commodity prices. Inspired by our formula, we've taken clear and decisive actions to respond to these near-term challenges and strengthen the bridge to value-adding growth in the future. To achieve this, we are focused on building on -- our strong liquidity, to further strengthen the balance sheet, to invest within cash flow, driving further operating efficiencies, enhancing margins and optimizing the portfolio. 
Starting first with liquidity, Southwestern Energy's liquidity position is strong, with $1.9 billion of undrawn capacity on our $2 billion unsecured revolver at the end of 2015. Withdrawing on that liquidity to invest in wells that have marginal economics in today's price environment does not make sense to us. We will continue to watch prices as we get further into the year and we can adjust accordingly. Craig will go into more detail of our liquidity and our financials in just a few moments. 
Another foundational aspect of our company is that future cash flows generated from our currently producing wells and our Midstream assets, more than exceeds our total debt obligations for the company due to our large high-quality asset base and cash flows for Midstream. Strengthening the balance sheet is a key priority for us in 2016. We do not plan to add to debt and are actively pursuing a number of options to reduce our debt levels. Additionally, we have previously disclosed we have taken decisive steps, including idling our company-owned drilling rigs and frac fleets, as we are committed to invest within cash flow based on strip pricing in 2016. We are reviewing options for potential asset sales and as we make tangible progress and have decisions in this area, we will share them with you. 
We're driving further operating efficiency, we have taken further steps to improve our margin by removing costs, resulting from reduced activity, and lower ongoing -- lowering our ongoing cost structure. As a result of this decreased activity, in January, we announced a workforce reduction with deep personal regret that impacted 40% of our SWN team. When we looked at commodity prices and our current plans, there just wasn't enough activity to support that size of employee base. 
Also announced yesterday, we have recently finalized a new agreement that reduces the gathering, transportation and processing rates in our Southwest Appalachia acreage. This provides 2 major benefits for us: first, it significantly lowers the gathering rates of our existing production in this important growth asset; and second, it provides a highly competitive dry gas gathering solution for the core of our West Virginia acreage, creating an additional optionality to allocate capital to wet gas or dry gas locations, including our Utica potential as commodity prices dictate. 
These 2 actions alone have reduced our ongoing annual cost structure by more than $200 million. On the top line, we are unlocking additional value from existing wells through a series of changes we are making to drilling, completions and operating practices. The results are encouraging and our teams are working across the company to unlock additional value. 
Let me turn it to Craig for a moment to discuss some of our financial highlights, followed by Paul Geiger, who will discuss some of their -- our operational highlights and the exciting first year of our ownership of our Southwest Appalachia asset."

As Bill mentioned, Southwestern and the industry are facing challenges in this commodity price environment. While these challenges are substantial and require action, we have a significant amount of liquidity with our $2 billion unsecured revolver that does not mature until late 2018. Southwestern and much of the industry have also experienced recent credit rating downgrades by the rating agencies and expanding credit metrics as a result of this environment. We are working to address these issues on a number of fronts. However, these actions and metrics have had no impact on our unsecured revolver or other debt instruments other than a minimal increase in our expected 2016 cash interest costs at our year-end 2015 debt balances. 
And assuming those year-end 2015 debt balances, total cash interest cost across all of our debt instruments will increase as a result of these downgrades by about $30 million on an annual basis beginning in 2017 and will begin declining again in 2018. Our substantial liquidity position and active balance sheet management differentiates Southwestern from others. And when combined with our strong portfolio of assets, positions Southwestern well for a strong future. 
Additionally, and to emphasize a point that Bill made, these existing assets provide a substantial cash flow stream that at current commodity price forecasts, not only services our debt, but pays it off over time. From a capital investment perspective, in 2015, we began exhibiting our flexibility and modified our activities to align with the current environment as we moved throughout the year. Importantly, we adjusted our capital investments down to $1.8 billion. This is a reduction of 30% from our original capital guidance of $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year and $50 million below our most recent public guidance. With this reduction, we were still able to deliver record production volumes of 976 Bcfe, a 27% increase over 2014, 9% of which was organic growth. And this growth reflects our significant operating achievements across the portfolio, despite the depressed commodity price environment. 
I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our first year of operations in our Southwest Appalachia business."

Our first year of operations with the assets in Southwest Appalachia was an outstanding one from an operational perspective. We efficiently integrated the Southwest Appalachia asset into SWN during 2015. We leveraged the many learnings and successes from our entry into Northeast Appalachia in Pennsylvania and once again demonstrated our ability to ramp quickly and produce impressive operating results in a short period of time. 
Our Southwest Appalachia asset has exceeded our expectations in every operational aspect as compared to our acquisition model. The teams hit the ground running, delivering top quartile of drilling and completion efficiencies, a full 2 years ahead of expectations. Not only cost efficient, this high-quality execution resulted in an over 94% success rate of placing the drilled laterals, some as long as 12,000 feet, within our targeted 12-foot thick interval of the Marcellus. This exceptional performance, combined with much higher sand concentration in our completions, resulted in well performance that ranges from 30% to 100% better than the wells drilled by the previous operator on the same pad. 
One outstanding pad development is our -- of this program is our Alice Edge pad in the Central Panhandle. We were able to drill and complete 4 additional wells on this pad, placing 98% of the 43,000 feet of drilled lateral in our 12-foot target within the Marcellus interval. Initial production from the 9 total wells on this pad was over 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day, over half of which was liquids. 
In total, this initial year of drilling ramped production from these assets by over 65%, demonstrating the potential of this position. These factors have also increased our expectations of our core Panhandle acreage by over 50% on a per acre basis as compared to our acquisition. 
Over 200,000 of our 425,000 acres are in this core of the core for Marcellus and Utica development, over 60% of which is held by production and over 80% of which has no obligations until 2018 or later. We accomplished a lot in our first year with this asset and we are not standing still. We are working to identify additional ways to improve returns as we continue development of this premium acreage position within a world-class producing basin. 
Across the company, 2015 included record drilling results, record well performance, material well cost savings and terrific results from our base production enhancement efforts. This performance has allowed us to build an even stronger base as we begin 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Bill for additional comments on 2016."

As we close the books on 2015, I want to turn forward and look at 2016. And as I mentioned earlier, our strategy will be one that focuses on rigorous financial discipline and unlocking additional value. With our commitment to investing within cash flow, we issued guidance yesterday afternoon, as you know, that included a minimal amount of new activity. We are committed to investing only in projects that meet or exceed our 1.3 PVI hurdle and in this environment, that can return their cash flow from investment in this year. We are prepared for a prolonged low price environment, but we remain equipped with the flexibility and liquidity to ramp activity quickly when prices improve. With this planned activity, production is expected to decline. And while this is different from our typical E&P operational plan, we are very different -- we're in very different times from a commodity price perspective, and we believe this is the prudent path to take for now. 
Having said this, as prices recover, we have the ability to ramp up and increase activity quickly and capture the value that is associated with those improved prices. We have the core DNA in each area of our operation that will allow us to pivot from our current activity level to evaluating growth as market fundamentals normalize. 
So I want to stop here with my remarks so we can get back to the operator and -- who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

The simple fact that our production is declining from a company as large as ours is, in itself, a market signal. I think when I look at 2017 and 2018, we've got various scenarios on how we might progress, but I want to see first how the rest of this year, at least the early part of this year, plays out. If you look at our current portfolio, every $0.20 -- $0.25 movement in gas, adds $200 million in cash flow to our bottom line. And with our mandate to invest within cash flow, as we see prices improve, one of the opportunities for us is to get back into and restart our drilling and completions. We would certainly prioritize our work to wells that are currently drilled but not completed, and then prioritize across the company in terms of the highest PVI projects. And how that exactly would work, I think what we want to do is let 2016 play out a little longer. I carefully used the words, ""idled my rigs."" I didn't shut them down and take -- or take them away and get rid of them. We have the capability to restart fairly quickly. If you look at where we would invest, certainly, the economics in the Northeast tend to be the strongest economics we have. And as we have demonstrated, just by our well performance over the last couple of years, it takes far fewer rigs to drill and complete wells that have growing production than our original plan. So the number of rigs, the number of wells, all of that, we are continuing to work and we'll talk more about that as we move forward."

But I think the Constitution Pipeline is really caught up in some issues related to the State of New York more than just in general, because I think the State of Pennsylvania is ready to move on that. We have a portion of that pipeline in our portfolio. We've always planned it to be -- our earliest plan, 2 or 3 years ago, was for it to come on the end of this year. So we basically managed around it so that we're pretty flexible. At the end of the day, will it get done? I think if the people of New York want to capitalize on the great value that natural gas brings to heating, I think they will speak up and that project will move ahead. When you look at the Southwest Appalachia area, it's a bit of different dynamic. It seems there's -- it's a much more liquid market. There's a lot more opportunities and a lot more projects moving into the area and they seem to be moving at pace. I mean, we've got to listen to the various stakeholders, we've got to work together with the stakeholders, but from what we understand, those projects are moving along from the perspective of getting approvals and gaining all those. But certainly the market, as it unfolds going forward, and pricing will also help dictate the pace of those.

In fact, we spend a lot of time redrilling wells on paper to see how what we thought was going to happen, happened, and what we can do to change. The technology and the tools that are able to enable us to steer wells much closer to the drill bit than we ever have before, that oftentimes are used offshore, technology has enabled those tools to be readily available for us in a lower commodity -- lower-cost environment onshore in shale. And so we've got the ability to steer and we've got the ability to see where we want to steer, so lateral placement becomes so much more important. And as Paul said earlier, we can actually steer -- and one of the 12,000-foot laterals, I believe we actually stayed in a 12-foot zone for 100% of the time with the tools that we have. If you can stay in that zone and you can get that lateral drilled, then the completion techniques that we're using, especially around sand loading to improve the near wellbore quality of the frac, become significant. And the third thing, and Paul mentioned this as well, around the content of liquids to gas on these pads is just like the old days of Haynesville, but for different reasons, managing the drawdown on these reservoirs significantly improves or affects the outcome of the liquid content that is coming out of these wells. And so those techniques plus some of the work that we've done across the company and other areas around timing of beginning to flow wells, in terms of debottlenecking the infrastructure that is both downhole and on the surface, have really impacted the performance across our company and we continue to share that -- those techniques in each of the areas. We made a lot of these major strides when we moved into Pennsylvania about 5 years ago, 6 years ago, and the effects were significant. When we took that team and moved them over to West Virginia, and that team replicated that terrific -- those terrific results in there."

But what I can say is that at $3, our -- we still have a couple thousand wells in inventory that we can -- that meet our hurdle and that we can certainly go drill. And as the price comes off that, you have a full slate of wells that you can drill across the company and it gets back to that manage within cash flow circuit breaker that we have imposed on ourselves to make sure that we're not going past that. Obviously, the Fayetteville Shale is more sensitive to gas prices. And as you go through, so you can have -- at $3.50, you can have 5,000 well locations and at current prices today, that number drops significantly. In fact, we don't have economic wells to drill at this [indiscernible], at what is now the third lowest March strip since we began tracking all of this. So you do have -- there's a lot of swing there. When you move to the Northeast, certainly in Northeast Pennsylvania, it's less sensitive, but you still see a change dropoff if you've got 1,300 wells or so in the inventory. When prices get down, that number may drop down by half. Southwest Appalachia has 2 different kind of aspects to it. One is we have dry gas, we have wet gas, and the dry gas is even further subdivided into Marcellus and Utica. So as we work through the economics and certainly and a big deal is this gathering deal that we just finished with Williams, which expanded the pie for both of us and is a win-win for both of us and is enabling our -- the economic threshold of a big chunk of that acreage to improve. So you've got that dynamic as well. We finished our first Utica well and when we -- as far as drilling goes, we don't need to or plan to complete it at this time, because it's actually not in an area where a pipeline is built yet. And so our rigorous attention to margin is certainly there. But we know that, that area is far less sensitive to some of these changes in gas price and the inventory remains. So we've always been a low-cost operator, we will drive even further to get our structural costs to change and bring it down, along with these techniques that we've been talking about on improving the revenue side. In other words, the performance side of these wells, and I think we'll continue to move ourselves along those curves as well."

What, in your opinion, is your plan at this point with the dry gas at Utica? It feels like it's an area you can monetize or in fact develop as your most economic asset if it works out.

And as I've mentioned in my opening comments, the northern part of our acreage is where we've also captured a gathering solution with Williams to gather that gas. And so as we begin to -- the process of looking at how we want to lay that out now that we have that agreement in place, you can build that infrastructure out fairly quickly, again, driven by economics, driven by priority, but you can build that infrastructure out pretty quickly and then begin to look. Our next few wells in the area of the Utica were planned in the north and that was because the dry gas infrastructure is present around us and we can move them in. If you take a look at the wells that are being drilled and completed all around us, those wells are proving up our position and we're delighted with the success that our colleagues in the industry are having and it just reinforces the quality of the acreage that we have. And as soon as we can, in the priority of investing within cash flow and where they fit in the priority stack, we will begin going down that path. I would remind everyone that when we did the acquisition, our plans were to do -- to begin the process of drilling the Utica in 2018. And so the well that we drilled this last year advanced that by 2 years and we still see a lot of opportunities in that area. It's just a matter of prioritization at this point. And just to make some further clarity on the completion of the well that we did drill, we were going to put that into a wet gas system. It was a test in that part of our area and we wanted to do that. We've got -- we worked out arrangements to be able to do that, but obviously, when you're putting a dry gas well into a wet gas system, you need to take an impairment on economics. And so we'll just wait to complete that well. We'll go, if we get -- if and when we get into the Utica, we'll go north."

In closing our call, I want you to know I'm very confident that the actions we're implementing really does support our strategy, will allow us to drive through these times created by this commodity price position that we're in. We're going to optimize the business and continue to drive for every dollar we can in that area and then really position ourselves to return to value-adding growth when the environment improves. But before we kind of conclude, I want to emphasize the passion we have to deliver on these strategic priorities and to win in this environment, is really beyond -- is unwavering. That is probably the best way I can put that. I firmly believe that our strong liquidity position, our premier portfolio of assets, investing within cash flow as a mandate that we've imposed on ourselves, our capital discipline of investing only in projects that exceed our 1.3 PVI hurdle, our aggressive drive on margin improvement, and really probably the most important part, our team of extraordinary people across the company, will really enable us to execute the plan and allow us to forge ahead in these times and also create additional long-term value for our shareholders. 
In my experience, times like these, challenging times, are often when the industry delivers the brightest ideas that take us to the next level. And I can tell you, we plan to be a big part of that future and a big part of unlocking ideas and value from our curiosity and learning here at Southwestern.

With me today, I've got Craig Owen, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Sherrick, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Business Development; Paul Geiger, Senior Vice President of our Southwest Appalachia assets; and Michael Hancock, our Director of Investor Relations. 
If you've not received a copy of last night's 2 press releases regarding our fourth quarter 2015 financial and operating results, along with our 2016 initiatives and plan, you can find a copy of those on our website at swn.com. 
I'd also like to point out that many of the comments during this teleconference are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties affecting outcomes, many of which are beyond our control and are discussed in more detail in the risk factors and the forward-looking statements section of our annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results or developments may differ materially.
Now let's begin. In the 4 years that I've had the privilege of being part of this great company, our teams have accomplished a great deal. Southwestern Energy clearly has premier assets, disciplined capital investment, a low-cost operating model, a highly talented workforce and a strategy built upon our formula and inspired by our core values. I truly believe in the opportunities we have in front of us and the future success of our company. 
And although I know the company well, after moving into my current role last month, I thought it important to take stock and take a fresh look. And having done that, I'm confident that our strategy is an enduring one. And today, I want to share with you several priorities as we move forward. I believe that credibility is derived from consistently delivering on commitments made. And as such, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying assets, which is a core part of the SWN formula, will drive our decisions on investment activity when prices are high and when they are not. 
The industry is facing tremendous challenges, especially related to commodity prices. Inspired by our formula, we've taken clear and decisive actions to respond to these near-term challenges and strengthen the bridge to value-adding growth in the future. To achieve this, we are focused on building on -- our strong liquidity, to further strengthen the balance sheet, to invest within cash flow, driving further operating efficiencies, enhancing margins and optimizing the portfolio. 
Starting first with liquidity, Southwestern Energy's liquidity position is strong, with $1.9 billion of undrawn capacity on our $2 billion unsecured revolver at the end of 2015. Withdrawing on that liquidity to invest in wells that have marginal economics in today's price environment does not make sense to us. We will continue to watch prices as we get further into the year and we can adjust accordingly. Craig will go into more detail of our liquidity and our financials in just a few moments. 
Another foundational aspect of our company is that future cash flows generated from our currently producing wells and our Midstream assets, more than exceeds our total debt obligations for the company due to our large high-quality asset base and cash flows for Midstream. Strengthening the balance sheet is a key priority for us in 2016. We do not plan to add to debt and are actively pursuing a number of options to reduce our debt levels. Additionally, we have previously disclosed we have taken decisive steps, including idling our company-owned drilling rigs and frac fleets, as we are committed to invest within cash flow based on strip pricing in 2016. We are reviewing options for potential asset sales and as we make tangible progress and have decisions in this area, we will share them with you. 
We're driving further operating efficiency, we have taken further steps to improve our margin by removing costs, resulting from reduced activity, and lower ongoing -- lowering our ongoing cost structure. As a result of this decreased activity, in January, we announced a workforce reduction with deep personal regret that impacted 40% of our SWN team. When we looked at commodity prices and our current plans, there just wasn't enough activity to support that size of employee base. 
Also announced yesterday, we have recently finalized a new agreement that reduces the gathering, transportation and processing rates in our Southwest Appalachia acreage. This provides 2 major benefits for us: first, it significantly lowers the gathering rates of our existing production in this important growth asset; and second, it provides a highly competitive dry gas gathering solution for the core of our West Virginia acreage, creating an additional optionality to allocate capital to wet gas or dry gas locations, including our Utica potential as commodity prices dictate. 
These 2 actions alone have reduced our ongoing annual cost structure by more than $200 million. On the top line, we are unlocking additional value from existing wells through a series of changes we are making to drilling, completions and operating practices. The results are encouraging and our teams are working across the company to unlock additional value. 
Let me turn it to Craig for a moment to discuss some of our financial highlights, followed by Paul Geiger, who will discuss some of their -- our operational highlights and the exciting first year of our ownership of our Southwest Appalachia asset."

As Bill mentioned, Southwestern and the industry are facing challenges in this commodity price environment. While these challenges are substantial and require action, we have a significant amount of liquidity with our $2 billion unsecured revolver that does not mature until late 2018. Southwestern and much of the industry have also experienced recent credit rating downgrades by the rating agencies and expanding credit metrics as a result of this environment. We are working to address these issues on a number of fronts. However, these actions and metrics have had no impact on our unsecured revolver or other debt instruments other than a minimal increase in our expected 2016 cash interest costs at our year-end 2015 debt balances. 
And assuming those year-end 2015 debt balances, total cash interest cost across all of our debt instruments will increase as a result of these downgrades by about $30 million on an annual basis beginning in 2017 and will begin declining again in 2018. Our substantial liquidity position and active balance sheet management differentiates Southwestern from others. And when combined with our strong portfolio of assets, positions Southwestern well for a strong future. 
Additionally, and to emphasize a point that Bill made, these existing assets provide a substantial cash flow stream that at current commodity price forecasts, not only services our debt, but pays it off over time. From a capital investment perspective, in 2015, we began exhibiting our flexibility and modified our activities to align with the current environment as we moved throughout the year. Importantly, we adjusted our capital investments down to $1.8 billion. This is a reduction of 30% from our original capital guidance of $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year and $50 million below our most recent public guidance. With this reduction, we were still able to deliver record production volumes of 976 Bcfe, a 27% increase over 2014, 9% of which was organic growth. And this growth reflects our significant operating achievements across the portfolio, despite the depressed commodity price environment. 
I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our first year of operations in our Southwest Appalachia business."

Our first year of operations with the assets in Southwest Appalachia was an outstanding one from an operational perspective. We efficiently integrated the Southwest Appalachia asset into SWN during 2015. We leveraged the many learnings and successes from our entry into Northeast Appalachia in Pennsylvania and once again demonstrated our ability to ramp quickly and produce impressive operating results in a short period of time. 
Our Southwest Appalachia asset has exceeded our expectations in every operational aspect as compared to our acquisition model. The teams hit the ground running, delivering top quartile of drilling and completion efficiencies, a full 2 years ahead of expectations. Not only cost efficient, this high-quality execution resulted in an over 94% success rate of placing the drilled laterals, some as long as 12,000 feet, within our targeted 12-foot thick interval of the Marcellus. This exceptional performance, combined with much higher sand concentration in our completions, resulted in well performance that ranges from 30% to 100% better than the wells drilled by the previous operator on the same pad. 
One outstanding pad development is our -- of this program is our Alice Edge pad in the Central Panhandle. We were able to drill and complete 4 additional wells on this pad, placing 98% of the 43,000 feet of drilled lateral in our 12-foot target within the Marcellus interval. Initial production from the 9 total wells on this pad was over 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day, over half of which was liquids. 
In total, this initial year of drilling ramped production from these assets by over 65%, demonstrating the potential of this position. These factors have also increased our expectations of our core Panhandle acreage by over 50% on a per acre basis as compared to our acquisition. 
Over 200,000 of our 425,000 acres are in this core of the core for Marcellus and Utica development, over 60% of which is held by production and over 80% of which has no obligations until 2018 or later. We accomplished a lot in our first year with this asset and we are not standing still. We are working to identify additional ways to improve returns as we continue development of this premium acreage position within a world-class producing basin. 
Across the company, 2015 included record drilling results, record well performance, material well cost savings and terrific results from our base production enhancement efforts. This performance has allowed us to build an even stronger base as we begin 2016. 
I'll now turn it back over to Bill for additional comments on 2016."

As we close the books on 2015, I want to turn forward and look at 2016. And as I mentioned earlier, our strategy will be one that focuses on rigorous financial discipline and unlocking additional value. With our commitment to investing within cash flow, we issued guidance yesterday afternoon, as you know, that included a minimal amount of new activity. We are committed to investing only in projects that meet or exceed our 1.3 PVI hurdle and in this environment, that can return their cash flow from investment in this year. We are prepared for a prolonged low price environment, but we remain equipped with the flexibility and liquidity to ramp activity quickly when prices improve. With this planned activity, production is expected to decline. And while this is different from our typical E&P operational plan, we are very different -- we're in very different times from a commodity price perspective, and we believe this is the prudent path to take for now. 
Having said this, as prices recover, we have the ability to ramp up and increase activity quickly and capture the value that is associated with those improved prices. We have the core DNA in each area of our operation that will allow us to pivot from our current activity level to evaluating growth as market fundamentals normalize.

The simple fact that our production is declining from a company as large as ours is, in itself, a market signal. I think when I look at 2017 and 2018, we've got various scenarios on how we might progress, but I want to see first how the rest of this year, at least the early part of this year, plays out. If you look at our current portfolio, every $0.20 -- $0.25 movement in gas, adds $200 million in cash flow to our bottom line. And with our mandate to invest within cash flow, as we see prices improve, one of the opportunities for us is to get back into and restart our drilling and completions. We would certainly prioritize our work to wells that are currently drilled but not completed, and then prioritize across the company in terms of the highest PVI projects. And how that exactly would work, I think what we want to do is let 2016 play out a little longer. I carefully used the words, ""idled my rigs."" I didn't shut them down and take -- or take them away and get rid of them. We have the capability to restart fairly quickly. If you look at where we would invest, certainly, the economics in the Northeast tend to be the strongest economics we have. And as we have demonstrated, just by our well performance over the last couple of years, it takes far fewer rigs to drill and complete wells that have growing production than our original plan. So the number of rigs, the number of wells, all of that, we are continuing to work and we'll talk more about that as we move forward."

But I think the Constitution Pipeline is really caught up in some issues related to the State of New York more than just in general, because I think the State of Pennsylvania is ready to move on that. We have a portion of that pipeline in our portfolio. We've always planned it to be -- our earliest plan, 2 or 3 years ago, was for it to come on the end of this year. So we basically managed around it so that we're pretty flexible. At the end of the day, will it get done? I think if the people of New York want to capitalize on the great value that natural gas brings to heating, I think they will speak up and that project will move ahead. When you look at the Southwest Appalachia area, it's a bit of different dynamic. It seems there's -- it's a much more liquid market. There's a lot more opportunities and a lot more projects moving into the area and they seem to be moving at pace. I mean, we've got to listen to the various stakeholders, we've got to work together with the stakeholders, but from what we understand, those projects are moving along from the perspective of getting approvals and gaining all those. But certainly the market, as it unfolds going forward, and pricing will also help dictate the pace of those.

In fact, we spend a lot of time redrilling wells on paper to see how what we thought was going to happen, happened, and what we can do to change. The technology and the tools that are able to enable us to steer wells much closer to the drill bit than we ever have before, that oftentimes are used offshore, technology has enabled those tools to be readily available for us in a lower commodity -- lower-cost environment onshore in shale. And so we've got the ability to steer and we've got the ability to see where we want to steer, so lateral placement becomes so much more important. And as Paul said earlier, we can actually steer -- and one of the 12,000-foot laterals, I believe we actually stayed in a 12-foot zone for 100% of the time with the tools that we have. If you can stay in that zone and you can get that lateral drilled, then the completion techniques that we're using, especially around sand loading to improve the near wellbore quality of the frac, become significant. And the third thing, and Paul mentioned this as well, around the content of liquids to gas on these pads is just like the old days of Haynesville, but for different reasons, managing the drawdown on these reservoirs significantly improves or affects the outcome of the liquid content that is coming out of these wells. And so those techniques plus some of the work that we've done across the company and other areas around timing of beginning to flow wells, in terms of debottlenecking the infrastructure that is both downhole and on the surface, have really impacted the performance across our company and we continue to share that -- those techniques in each of the areas. We made a lot of these major strides when we moved into Pennsylvania about 5 years ago, 6 years ago, and the effects were significant. When we took that team and moved them over to West Virginia, and that team replicated that terrific -- those terrific results in there."

But what I can say is that at $3, our -- we still have a couple thousand wells in inventory that we can -- that meet our hurdle and that we can certainly go drill. And as the price comes off that, you have a full slate of wells that you can drill across the company and it gets back to that manage within cash flow circuit breaker that we have imposed on ourselves to make sure that we're not going past that. Obviously, the Fayetteville Shale is more sensitive to gas prices. And as you go through, so you can have -- at $3.50, you can have 5,000 well locations and at current prices today, that number drops significantly. In fact, we don't have economic wells to drill at this [indiscernible], at what is now the third lowest March strip since we began tracking all of this. So you do have -- there's a lot of swing there. When you move to the Northeast, certainly in Northeast Pennsylvania, it's less sensitive, but you still see a change dropoff if you've got 1,300 wells or so in the inventory. When prices get down, that number may drop down by half. Southwest Appalachia has 2 different kind of aspects to it. One is we have dry gas, we have wet gas, and the dry gas is even further subdivided into Marcellus and Utica. So as we work through the economics and certainly and a big deal is this gathering deal that we just finished with Williams, which expanded the pie for both of us and is a win-win for both of us and is enabling our -- the economic threshold of a big chunk of that acreage to improve. So you've got that dynamic as well. We finished our first Utica well and when we -- as far as drilling goes, we don't need to or plan to complete it at this time, because it's actually not in an area where a pipeline is built yet. And so our rigorous attention to margin is certainly there. But we know that, that area is far less sensitive to some of these changes in gas price and the inventory remains. So we've always been a low-cost operator, we will drive even further to get our structural costs to change and bring it down, along with these techniques that we've been talking about on improving the revenue side. In other words, the performance side of these wells, and I think we'll continue to move ourselves along those curves as well."

What, in your opinion, is your plan at this point with the dry gas at Utica? It feels like it's an area you can monetize or in fact develop as your most economic asset if it works out.

And as I've mentioned in my opening comments, the northern part of our acreage is where we've also captured a gathering solution with Williams to gather that gas. And so as we begin to -- the process of looking at how we want to lay that out now that we have that agreement in place, you can build that infrastructure out fairly quickly, again, driven by economics, driven by priority, but you can build that infrastructure out pretty quickly and then begin to look. Our next few wells in the area of the Utica were planned in the north and that was because the dry gas infrastructure is present around us and we can move them in. If you take a look at the wells that are being drilled and completed all around us, those wells are proving up our position and we're delighted with the success that our colleagues in the industry are having and it just reinforces the quality of the acreage that we have. And as soon as we can, in the priority of investing within cash flow and where they fit in the priority stack, we will begin going down that path. I would remind everyone that when we did the acquisition, our plans were to do -- to begin the process of drilling the Utica in 2018. And so the well that we drilled this last year advanced that by 2 years and we still see a lot of opportunities in that area. It's just a matter of prioritization at this point. And just to make some further clarity on the completion of the well that we did drill, we were going to put that into a wet gas system. It was a test in that part of our area and we wanted to do that. We've got -- we worked out arrangements to be able to do that, but obviously, when you're putting a dry gas well into a wet gas system, you need to take an impairment on economics. And so we'll just wait to complete that well. We'll go, if we get -- if and when we get into the Utica, we'll go north."

Lots of the energy companies in the United States are headquartered here, and it's impacting a lot of folks, so please keep them again in your minds and help out where you can. 
When I look at the company at the moment, on our last call, I walked through our strategic initiatives for this year and discussed how we would proactively drive through the current price environment to strengthen and cross the bridge to the future. As you read in last night's press release, we are delivering on that plan that we laid out. 
The first quarter demonstrated our focus and our resolve to deliver results as we exceed guidance on production volumes and delivered better margins than anticipated through production enhancements and cost savings initiatives. Our results are demonstrating a number of reasons to be confident about investing in Southwestern Energy. And I'd like to take a few minutes and walk through a few of those this morning with you.
Much of the gas price challenge being faced today is largely the result of the impact of one of the warmest winters on record. There are a number of signposts, however, indicating that the macro picture is changing and that the commodity price improvement may not be far away. With an over $45 billion reduction in industry-wide capital investments compared to 2015, a supply response and particularly -- potentially significant is underway in the industry. 
In the Marcellus and Utica areas alone, where some of the best dry gas rock is located, there were over 90 rigs running in the Northeast in 2015 while today, there are fewer than 40. This pattern has repeated itself across the country and in many cases, even more extreme level than in the Northeast. 
The recent EIA data released shows production in January of 2016 has flattened, remaining at levels back from in the summer of 2015. With these results being from very early 2016, this supply slowdown largely does not factor in the impacts of the 60% reduction in capital investment from last year. 
As we all know, it takes time for this investment slowdown to demonstrate its impacts on the supply. And in our view, this means the supply decline will likely even be greater as we move through the year. Recent data is estimating that the current U.S. dry gas production is lower year-over-year by over 1 Bcf per day for the month of April so far. 
The slowing supply is coming at a time when a strong demand story is no longer just a vision but is a visible reality. For years, the industry has discussed the upcoming LNG facilities, coal plant retirements, petrochemical expansions and pipeline exports. In 2016, we're seeing these materialize and tangibly increase U.S. demand. 
With Sabine Pass LNG terminal now up and running, incremental demand is online and forecasted to increase to over 1 Bcf per day by the end of 2016. Recent data also continues to show Mexico imports increasing, with these exports now totaling over 3.5 Bcf per day. This is up over 1.5 Bcf per day from 2015 levels. 
Another key source of the growing demand is power generation, where coal plant retirements and increasing gas-fired power demand are forecast to increase demand by over 2 Bcf per day by the end of the year. 
In addition to the improving macro position, another reason to be confident about Southwestern Energy is the progress being made on the strategic initiatives we've previously discussed that will set us up for differentiating value-adding growth when commodity prices do recover. Just a few months into the year, we are well on our way to delivering on that plan as we promised. 
Now I appreciate you all have keen interest in the options being considered, whether that is in maintaining our already strong liquidity position, managing our balance sheet or our asset sales efforts. Please allow us to continue to work on these. As I've commented to you before and I've committed to you before, at the appropriate time, we will talk in detail about the actions we have already taken to strengthen the balance sheet, and be assured we'd make good progress and are resolved to complete this work as clear as recently demonstrated by the tangible steps we took in the first quarter to maximize each of the available options to address strengthening the balance sheet. And again, we will discuss the pertinent options as we complete them throughout the year. 
Another key contributor to our confidence surrounding the company is associated with our ability to drive costs out of the system since we last spoke. Consistent with our historical approach of driving down cost, in less than 2 months since our call, we've identified an additional $40 million of 2016 cost savings. This is in addition to the $200 million previously disclosed. 
As we continue to look for ways to expand this number, Paul will discuss some of the main contributors to these savings to date in a few moments, but each area in the company has found ways to enhance their margins in the first quarter of 2016. 
Finally, I'm confident that with our vertical integration, we stand ready to respond as commodity prices support additional investment activity. Owning our own rig fleet and completion equipment and having terrific teams to manage them will allow us the ability to bring wells to sales very quickly as market conditions warrant. 
Now let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights, and he will be followed by Paul, who will discuss some of our operational highlights for the first quarter."

As Bill mentioned, we had a strong quarter exceeding the guidance we released in February and are making progress on each of the strategic initiatives we outlined at that time. 
One of the key focus items was to strengthen our balance sheet. In the first quarter, we maintained our emphasis on liquidity by adjusting our activity level with cash flow. Our net cash flow was $147 million while our capital investments were $122 million in the quarter. This demonstrates our differentiating capital discipline. 
We also enhanced our liquidity with the position to pay our April preferred dividend in common shares, preserving $27 million in cash. We used our strong liquidity position to temporarily borrow $1.55 billion at the end of the quarter to maximize our secured and subsidiary debt capacity. This entire amount was paid back in full on April 1. 
We appreciate that there are many questions and heightened interest regarding our plans, if any, to utilize this secured and subsidiary debt capacity to address our debt maturities. However, and as Bill mentioned, we will not be addressing further details or specifics on what we are considering possible terms, status of discussions or anything else on the topic today. 
Another component of strengthening the balance sheet includes potential asset sales. As the press release noted last night, our asset sales process is continuing. As we will make a decision on which asset sales make the most sense to move forward with as an option to address our debt levels. We will update you more on these decisions as these decisions are finalized. 
In an effort to further protect the balance sheet in this challenging commodity price environment, we were also able to add commodity hedges in the first quarter. We now have hedges for 107 Bcf or approximately 20% of our estimated 2016 remaining production, utilizing a combination of swaps and puts at an average price of $2.43. Approximately 100 Bcf of this amount covers April through October production when we see commodity prices remain challenged -- most challenged as stores levels are worked back toward normal ranges. We will continue to monitor market conditions and look for opportunities to add to our hedge portfolio.
I will now turn over to Paul to discuss a few of the first quarter operating highlights."

I'll briefly run through some of our first quarter activities for our E&P and Midstream businesses. We completed 9 wells and brought 12 wells to sales. We expect to place an additional 11 wells to sales in the second quarter. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, one of our key focus areas during the first 3 months of 2016 has been an aggressive pursuit of margin enhancements. This emphasis has been placed on both the revenue side and cost side of margin. 
On the revenue side, we exceeded the top end of our production guidance by 2 Bcfe as a result of our production enhancement efforts in the first quarter. This was the result of a number of initiatives, including the increased production from compression and gathering system optimization projects. Also across the company, strong well performance resulted in shallower decline of our base production than previously estimated.
In Southwest Appalachia, we placed 7 wells to sales in 2015 with lateral links over 10,000 feet. The declines on these wells continue to outperform wells in the area, and we are learning a lot from the performance of these wells that will be applied in future drilling to enhance value. 
Another example of outperformance is the Pad, which was brought online in November of 2015. This pad is currently producing 85 million cubic feet equivalent per day from 9 wells after almost 5 months in production.
In addition to production improvements, we have realized over $15 million of operating expense savings in the first quarter through a review of operational practices, vendor usage and contract terms. These savings is in addition to the more than $35 million in annual savings associated with the gathering contract changes that were finalized early in the first quarter. 
With this focus on cost reductions, our E&P cash costs, which include LOE, G&A and taxes other than income taxes, decreased to $1.15 per Mcfe for the first quarter of '16 as compared to $1.28 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2015.
In the first quarter, we were able to reduce our water handling costs through reduced contractual rates with our vendors and by finding more efficient routes to move water. In Midstream, we are finding ways to further optimize our compressor fleet to align with production level changes. In the first quarter, we realized $4 million in savings primarily through equipment and maintenance optimization. As a result of these and other efforts, we have identified over $40 million in expected annual savings for 2016.
The company's differentiating firm transportation and sales portfolio once again provided tangible benefits. For the first quarter of 2016, our Appalachia firm transportation and sales portfolio added over $30 million in value compared to selling produced volumes into local production area indices. 
In addition to the pricing benefits we received from our own natural gas, we were able to utilize some of the unused capacity within our firm transportation portfolio to generate additional margin. Our Appalachian transportation and sales portfolio will continue to be an asset that we leverage as we move forward. As a reminder, in the Northeast Appalachia, we have built an outstanding firm transportation portfolio that allows us to move our gas to multiple markets with volume and term flexibility.
Another way we are working to create Value+ in today's environment is by focusing on increasing our learnings from historical drilling and completion techniques and results. For example, our teams are redrilling wells on paper to identify improvement opportunities and fine-tune their geologic models to further increase the efficiency of future drilling activities. With these learnings, the company expects to further optimize our well economics and to add to shareholder value.
That concludes today's prepared comments. So we will now turn it back to the operator who will explain the procedures for asking questions."

I'll let Paul talk a little bit about it in a second. But a quick couple of factors out on the table. One, when we first went into West Virginia, our initial plans were to drill Utica wells beginning in 2018 and begin to ramp that program at that time. You'll know that we drilled a Utica well in a portion of our acreage. We have not completed it yet. And as we've ranked capital projects this year and prioritized them, we're keeping that one in mind on when we've actually completed. We have some additional Utica wells planned for other portions of our acreage that are said in the Q. And I think a lot of it really depends on where gas prices go, where liquids prices go and the balance between wet and dry Marcellus and Utica. And then we operate as a portfolio so then you go up and look in the Northeast of Pennsylvania, the dry gas Marcellus area as well. So too early to tell in specific drilling schedule, but we have advanced the process from 2018 to sooner just on a general basis because we've already made that one well test. The other thing that we're excited about is that we have for the area where we would put down the next Utica well series when we get to that point, we have a dry gas solution in hand and we're -- which would enable us to have that optionality to go in any of the particular areas we want to drill."

Based on what I've just said, all of our areas with the exception of Fayetteville are economic. And it gets back to a question of investing within cash flow. And as we see that cash flow be assured, then we can increase that investment. And I think we've talked about before. Our -- if you look at the highest capital-efficient wells that we have, and we -- and I'm using averages here. So we've had some stellar wells in Fayetteville that have exceeded our expectations even this year. But on average, my highest capital-efficient areas will be the Northeast and it will depend really on the fact that we now have NGLs as a part of this. And so as you look at NGL pricing and gas pricing. But basically, West Virginia and Pennsylvania both would be in the top of that priority list. The other thing that we would do is look at our inventory. And we've got somewhere less than 100 of those that -- or excuse me, just over 100 of those that we would put in the front of the line bring cash flow back simply because they're already drilled so as you're looking at buyer to station."

And so we're watching those from a decline standpoint. There's some -- there were some industry concern about are you able to effectively produce the tail end of that lateral? We believe we are through a various combination of things, including well plugs, through plugs, things like that. We think we're getting good contribution there. But as you'll recall from our earlier comments regarding overall productive strategy, the ability to have tight landing zone control, the ability to have increased sand on completions and the ability to have managed drawdown were big factors, we believe, to outperformance from a well standpoint. So the longer laterals, we believe we're able to produce of those at a managed rate and get improved EURs. But then also in our liquids rich Marcellus area has also increased liquids recovery versus offset shorter laterals or wells with higher drawdown.

Before we get started, parts of the Greater Houston area, which is our home here at Southwestern Energy, have experienced some rather epic flooding, and it continues to impact the city.

Lots of the energy companies in the United States are headquartered here, and it's impacting a lot of folks, so please keep them again, in your minds and help out where you can.
When I look at the company at the moment, on our last call, I walked through our strategic initiatives for this year and discussed how we would proactively drive through the current price environment to strengthen and cross the bridge to the future. As you read in last night's press release, we are delivering on that plan that we laid out.
The first quarter demonstrated our focus and our resolve to deliver results as we exceed guidance on production volumes and delivered better margins than anticipated through production enhancements and cost savings initiatives. Our results are demonstrating a number of reasons to be confident about investing in Southwestern Energy. And I'd like to take a few minutes and walk through a few of those this morning with you.
Much of the gas price challenge being faced today is largely the result of the impact of one of the warmest winters on record. There are a number of signposts, however, indicating that the macro picture is changing and that the commodity price improvement may not be far away. With an over $45 billion reduction in industry-wide capital investments compared to 2015, a supply response and particularly -- potentially significant is underway in the industry.
In the Marcellus and Utica areas alone, where some of the best dry gas rock is located, there were over 90 rigs running in the Northeast in 2015 while today, there are fewer than 40. This pattern has repeated itself across the country and in many cases, even more extreme level than in the Northeast.
The recent EIA data released shows production in January of 2016 has flattened, remaining at levels back from in the summer of 2015. With these results being -- from very early 2016, this supply slowdown largely does not factor in the impacts of the 60% reduction in capital investment from last year.
As we all know, it takes time for this investment slowdown to demonstrate its impacts on the supply. And in our view, this means the supply decline will likely even be greater as we move through the year. Recent data is estimating that the current U.S. dry gas production is lower year-over-year by over 1 Bcf per day for the month of April so far.
The slowing supply is coming at a time when a strong demand story is no longer just a vision but is a visible reality. For years, the industry has discussed the upcoming LNG facilities, coal plant retirements, petrochemical expansions and pipeline exports. In 2016, we're seeing these materialize and tangibly increase U.S. demand.
With Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG terminal now up and running, incremental demand is online and forecasted to increase to over 1 Bcf per day by the end of 2016. Recent data also continues to show Mexico imports increasing, with these exports now totaling over 3.5 Bcf per day. This is up over 1.5 Bcf per day from 2015 levels.
Another key source of the growing demand is power generation, where coal plant retirements and increasing gas-fired power demand are forecast to increase demand by over 2 Bcf per day by the end of the year.
In addition to the approving macro position, another reason to be confident about Southwestern Energy is the progress being made on the strategic initiatives we've previously discussed that will set us up for differentiating value-adding growth when commodity prices do recover. Just a few months into the year, we are well on our way to delivering on that plan as we promised.
Now I appreciate you all are -- have keen interest in the options being considered, whether that is in maintaining our already strong liquidity position, managing our balance sheet or our asset sales efforts. Please allow us to continue to work on these. As I've commented to you before and I've committed to you before, at the appropriate time, we will talk in detail about the actions we have already taken to strengthen the balance sheet, and be assured, we'd make good progress, and our resolve to complete this work is clear as recently demonstrated by the tangible steps we took in the first quarter to maximize each of the available options to address strengthening the balance sheet. And again, we will discuss the pertinent options as we complete them throughout the year.
Another key contributor to our confidence surrounding the company is associated with our ability to drive costs out of the system since we last spoke. Consistent with our historical approach of driving down cost, in less than 2 months since our call, we've identified an additional $40 million of 2016 cost savings. This is in addition to the $200 million previously disclosed.
As we continue to look for ways to expand this number, Paul will discuss some of the main contributors to these savings to date in a few moments, but each area in the company has found ways to enhance their margins in the first quarter of 2016.
Finally, I'm confident that with our vertical integration, we stand ready to respond as commodity prices support additional investment activity. Owning our own rig fleet and completion equipment and having terrific teams to manage them will allow us the ability to bring wells to sales very quickly as market conditions warrant.
Now let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights, and he will be followed by Paul, who will discuss some of our operational highlights for the first quarter."

As Bill mentioned, we had a strong quarter exceeding the guidance we released in February and are making progress on each of the strategic initiatives we outlined at that time.
One of the key focus items was to strengthen our balance sheet. In the first quarter, we maintained our emphasis on liquidity by adjusting our activity level with cash flow. Our net cash flow was $147 million while our capital investments were $122 million in the quarter. This demonstrates our differentiating capital discipline.
We also enhanced our liquidity with the decision to pay our April preferred dividend in common shares, preserving $27 million in cash. We used our strong liquidity position to temporarily borrow $1.55 billion at the end of the quarter to maximize our secured and subsidiary debt capacity. This entire amount was paid back in full on April 1.
We appreciate that there are many questions and heightened interest regarding our plans, if any, to utilize this secured and subsidiary debt capacity to address our debt maturities. However, and as Bill mentioned, we will not be addressing further details or specifics on what we are considering, possible terms, status of discussions or anything else on the topic today.
Another component of strengthening the balance sheet includes potential asset sales. As the press release noted last night, our asset sales process is continuing. As bids are received, we will make a decision on which asset sales make the most sense to move forward with as an option to address our debt levels. We will update you more on these decisions as these decisions are finalized.
In an effort to further protect the balance sheet in this challenging commodity price environment, we were also able to add commodity hedges in the first quarter. We now have hedges for 107 Bcf or approximately 20% of our estimated 2016 remaining production, utilizing a combination of swaps and puts at an average price of $2.43. Approximately 100 Bcf of this amount covers April through October production when we see commodity prices remain challenged -- most challenged as stores levels are worked back toward normal ranges. We will continue to monitor market conditions and look for opportunities to add to our hedge portfolio.
I will now turn over to Paul to discuss a few of the first quarter operating highlights."

I'll briefly run through some of our first quarter activities for our E&P and Midstream businesses. We completed 9 wells and brought 12 wells to sales. We expect to place an additional 11 wells to sales in the second quarter.
As Bill mentioned earlier, one of our key focus areas during the first 3 months of 2016 has been an aggressive pursuit of margin enhancements. This emphasis has been placed on both the revenue side and cost side of the margin.
On the revenue side, we exceeded the top end of our production guidance by 2 Bcfe as a result of our production enhancement efforts in the first quarter. This was the result of a number of initiatives, including the increased production from compression and gathering system optimization projects. Also across the company, strong well performance resulted in shallower decline of our base production than previously estimated.
In Southwest Appalachia, we placed 7 wells to sales in 2015, with lateral links over 10,000 feet. The declines on these wells continue to outperform offset wells in the area, and we are learning a lot from the performance of these wells that will be applied in future drilling to enhance value.
Another example of outperformance is the Alice Edge pad, which was brought online in November of 2015. This pad is currently producing 85 million cubic feet equivalent per day from 9 wells after almost 5 months in production.
In addition to production improvements, we have realized over $15 million of operating expense savings in the first quarter through a review of operational practices, vendor usage and contract terms. These savings is in addition to the more than $35 million in annual savings associated with the gathering contract changes that were finalized early in the first quarter.
With this focus on cost reductions, our E&P cash costs, which include LOE, G&A and taxes other than income taxes, decreased to $1.15 per Mcfe for the first quarter of '16 as compared to $1.28 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2015.
In the first quarter, we were able to reduce our water handling costs through reduced contractual rates with our vendors and by finding more efficient routes to move water. In Midstream, we are finding ways to further optimize our compressor fleet to align with production level changes. In the first quarter, we realized $4 million in savings, primarily through equipment and maintenance optimization. As a result of these and other efforts, we have identified over $40 million in expected annual savings for 2016.
The company's differentiating firm transportation and sales portfolio once again provided tangible benefits. For the first quarter of 2016, our Appalachia firm transportation and sales portfolio added over $30 million in value compared to selling produced volumes into local production area indices.
In addition to the pricing benefits we received from our own natural gas, we were able to utilize some of the unused capacity within our firm transportation portfolio to generate additional margin. Our Appalachian transportation and sales portfolio will continue to be an asset that we leverage as we move forward. As a reminder, in the Northeast Appalachia, we have built an outstanding firm transportation portfolio that allows us to move our gas to multiple markets with volume and term flexibility.
Another way we are working to create Value+ in today's environment is by focusing on increasing our learnings from historical drilling and completion techniques and results. For example, our teams are redrilling wells on paper to identify improvement opportunities and fine-tune their geologic models to further increase the efficiency of future drilling activities. With these learnings, the company expects to further optimize our well economics and to add to shareholder value.
That concludes today's prepared comments. So we will now turn it back to the operator who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

You'll know that we've drilled a Utica well in a portion of our acreage. We have not completed it yet. And as we've ranked capital projects this year and prioritized them, we're keeping that one in mind on when we've actually completed. We have some additional Utica wells planned for other portions of our acreage that are set in the queue. And I think a lot of it really depends on where gas prices go, where liquids prices go and the balance between wet and dry Marcellus and Utica. And then we operate it as a portfolio, so then you go up and look in the Northeast of Pennsylvania and the dry gas Marcellus area as well. So too early to tell in specific drilling schedule, but we have advanced the process from 2018 to sooner, just on a general basis because we've already made that one well test. The other thing that we're excited about is that we have for the area where we would put down the next Utica well series.

Based on what I've just said, all of our areas, with the exception of Fayetteville, are economic. And it gets back to a question of investing within cash flow. And as we see that cash flow be assured, then we can increase that investment. And I think we've talked about before, our -- if you look at the highest capital-efficient wells that we have, and we -- and I'm using averages here. So we've had some stellar wells in Fayetteville that have exceeded our expectations even this year. But on average, my highest capital-efficient areas will be the Northeast, and it will depend really on the fact that we now have NGLs as a part of this. And so as you look at NGL pricing and gas pricing. But basically, West Virginia and Pennsylvania both would be in the top of that priority list. The other thing that we would do is look at our dock inventory. And we've got somewhere less than 100 of those that -- or excuse me, just over 100 of those that we would put in the front of the line because they bring cash flow back cyclically because they're already drilled so as you're looking at prioritization."

As we -- certainly it's the most economic thing to do on paper, right? From a fixed and variable cost and benefit standpoint is to push those laterals out as long as you think you can get incremental economic returns. So that's on paper. And so what we've demonstrated a few of those operationally and been able to get out and not only drill but complete those and drill those out, bring them on to production. And so we're watching those from a decline standpoint. There's some -- there was some industry concern about are you able to effectively produce the tail end of that lateral? We believe we are through a various combination of things, including dissolvable plugs, flow-through plugs, things like that. We think we're getting good contribution there. But as you recall from our earlier comments regarding overall productive strategy, the ability to have tight landing zone control, the ability to have increased sand on completions and the ability to have managed drawdown were big factors, we believe, to outperformance this from a well standpoint. So the longer laterals, we believe, were able to produce those at a managed rate and get improved EURs. But then also in our liquids rich Marcellus area has also increased liquids recovery versus offset shorter laterals or wells with higher drawdown.

And we're excited about the future that we have in front of us and are looking forward to talking with you again about these accomplishments as we continue to generate them. And until then, we want to thank you for being here with us today, and I hope you have a great weekend.
So thanks a lot."

Before we get started, parts of the Greater Houston area, which is our home here at Southwestern Energy, have experienced some rather epic flooding, and it continues to impact the city. And I just ask you all to keep the people of the Greater Houston area in your hearts and minds and ask you all in the call to support any kind of relief efforts through your time or your treasure. Lots of the energy companies in the United States are headquartered here, and it's impacting a lot of folks, so please keep them, again, in your minds and help out where you can.
When I look at the company at the moment, on our last call, I walked through our strategic initiatives for this year and discussed how we would proactively drive through the current price environment to strengthen and cross the bridge to the future. As you read in last night's press release, we are delivering on that plan that we laid out.
The first quarter demonstrated our focus and our resolve to deliver results as we exceeded guidance on production volumes and delivered better margins than anticipated through production enhancements and cost savings initiatives. Our results are demonstrating a number of reasons to be confident about investing in Southwestern Energy. And I'd like to take a few minutes and walk through a few of those this morning with you.
Much of the gas price challenge being faced today is largely the result of the impact of one of the warmest winters on record. There are a number of signposts, however, indicating that the macro picture is changing and that a commodity price improvement may not be far away. With an over $45 billion reduction in industry-wide capital investments compared to 2015, a supply response and particularly -- potentially significant is underway in the industry.
In the Marcellus and Utica areas alone, where some of the best dry gas rock is located, there were over 90 rigs running in the Northeast in 2015, while today, there are fewer than 40. This pattern has repeated itself across the country and, in many cases, even more extreme level than in the Northeast.
The recent EIA data released shows production in January of 2016 has flattened, remaining at levels back from in the summer of 2015. With these results being -- from very early 2016, this supply slowdown largely does not factor in the impacts of the 60% reduction in capital investment from last year.
As we all know, it takes time for this investment slowdown to demonstrate its impacts on the supply. And in our view, this means the supply decline will likely even be greater as we move through the year. Recent data is estimating that the current U.S. dry gas production is lower year-over-year by over 1 Bcf per day for the month of April so far.
The slowing supply is coming at a time when a strong demand story is no longer just a vision but is a visible reality. For years, the industry has discussed the upcoming LNG facilities, coal plant retirements, petrochemical expansions and pipeline exports. In 2016, we're seeing these materialize and tangibly increase U.S. demand.
With Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG terminal now up and running, incremental demand is online and forecasted to increase to over 1 Bcf per day by the end of 2016. Recent data also continues to show Mexico imports increasing with these exports now totaling over 3.5 Bcf per day. This is up over 1.5 Bcf per day from 2015 levels.
Another key source of the growing demand is power generation where coal plant retirements and increasing gas-fired power demand are forecast to increase demand by over 2 Bcf per day by the end of the year.
In addition to the improving macro position, another reason to be confident about Southwestern Energy is the progress being made on the strategic initiatives we previously discussed that will set us up for differentiating value-adding growth when commodity prices do recover. Just a few months into the year, we are well on our way to delivering on that plan as we promised.
Now I appreciate you all are -- have keen interest in the options being considered, whether that is in maintaining our already strong liquidity position, managing our balance sheet or our asset sales efforts. Please allow us to continue to work on these. As I've commented to you before and I've committed to you before, at the appropriate time, we will talk in detail about the actions we have already taken to strengthen the balance sheet, and be assured, we've make good progress, and our resolve to complete this work is clear as recently demonstrated by the tangible steps we took in the first quarter to maximize each of the available options to address strengthening the balance sheet. And again, we will discuss the pertinent options as we complete them throughout the year.
Another key contributor to our confidence surrounding the company is associated with our ability to drive cost out of the system since we last spoke. Consistent with our historical approach of driving down costs, in less than 2 months since our call, we've identified an additional $40 million of 2016 cost savings. This is in addition to the $200 million previously disclosed.
As we continue to look for ways to expand this number, Paul will discuss some of the main contributors to these savings to-date in a few moments, but each area in the company has found ways to enhance their margins in the first quarter of 2016.
Finally, I'm confident that, with our vertical integration, we stand ready to respond as commodity prices support additional investment activity. Owning our own rig fleet and completion equipment and having terrific teams to manage them will allow us the ability to bring wells to sales very quickly as market conditions warrant.
Now let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights, and he will be followed by Paul, who will discuss some of our operational highlights for the first quarter."

As Bill mentioned, we had a strong quarter exceeding the guidance we released in February and are making progress on each of the strategic initiatives we outlined at that time.
One of the key focus items was to strengthen our balance sheet. In the first quarter, we maintained our emphasis on liquidity by adjusting our activity level with cash flow. Our net cash flow was $147 million while our capital investments were $122 million in the quarter. This demonstrates our differentiating capital discipline.
We also enhanced our liquidity with the decision to pay our April preferred dividend in common shares, preserving $27 million in cash. We used our strong liquidity position to temporarily borrow $1.55 billion at the end of the quarter to maximize our secured and subsidiary debt capacity. This entire amount was paid back in full on April 1.
We appreciate that there are many questions and heightened interest regarding our plans, if any, to utilize this secured and subsidiary debt capacity to address our debt maturities. However, and as Bill mentioned, we will not be addressing further details or specifics on what we are considering, possible terms, status of discussions or anything else on the topic today.
Another component of strengthening the balance sheet includes potential asset sales. As the press release noted last night, our asset sales process is continuing. As bids are received, we will make a decision on which asset sales make the most sense to move forward with as an option to address our debt levels. We will update you more on these decisions as these decisions are finalized.
In an effort to further protect the balance sheet in this challenging commodity price environment, we were also able to add commodity hedges in the first quarter. We now have hedges for 107 Bcf or approximately 20% of our estimated 2016 remaining production, utilizing a combination of swaps and puts at an average price of $2.43. Approximately 100 Bcf of this amount covers April through October production when we see commodity prices remain challenged -- most challenged as stores' levels are worked back toward normal ranges. We will continue to monitor market conditions and look for opportunities to add to our hedge portfolio.
I will now turn over to Paul to discuss a few of the first quarter operating highlights."

I'll briefly run through some of our first quarter activities for our E&P and Midstream businesses. We completed 9 wells and brought 12 wells to sales. We expect to place an additional 11 wells to sales in the second quarter.
As Bill mentioned earlier, one of our key focus areas during the first 3 months of 2016 has been an aggressive pursuit of margin enhancements. This emphasis has been placed on both the revenue side and cost side of the margin.
On the revenue side, we exceeded the top end of our production guidance by 2 Bcfe as a result of our production enhancement efforts in the first quarter. This was the result of a number of initiatives, including the increased production from compression and gathering system optimization projects. Also, across the company, strong well performance resulted in shallower decline of our base production than previously estimated.
In Southwest Appalachia, we placed 7 wells to sales in 2015 with lateral links over 10,000 feet. The declines on these wells continue to outperform offset wells in the area, and we are learning a lot from the performance of these wells that will be applied in future drilling to enhance value.
Another example of outperformance is the Alice Edge pad, which was brought online in November of 2015. This pad is currently producing 85 million cubic feet equivalent per day from 9 wells after almost 5 months of production.
In addition to production improvements, we have realized over $15 million of operating expense savings in the first quarter through a review of operational practices, vendor usage and contract terms. This savings is in addition to the more than $35 million in annual savings associated with the gathering contract changes that were finalized early in the first quarter.
With this focus on cost reductions, our E&P cash costs, which include LOE, G&A and taxes other than income taxes, decreased to $1.15 per Mcfe for the first quarter of '16 as compared to $1.28 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2015.
In the first quarter, we were able to reduce our water-handling costs through reduced contractual rates with our vendors and by finding more efficient routes to move water. In Midstream, we are finding ways to further optimize our compressor fleet to align with production level changes. In the first quarter, we realized $4 million in savings, primarily through equipment and maintenance optimization. As a result of these and other efforts, we have identified over $40 million in expected annual savings for 2016.
The company's differentiating firm transportation and sales portfolio once again provided tangible benefits. For the first quarter of 2016, our Appalachia firm transportation and sales portfolio added over $30 million in value compared to selling produced volumes into local production area indices.
In addition to the pricing benefits we received from our own natural gas, we were able to utilize some of the unused capacity within our firm transportation portfolio to generate additional margin. Our Appalachian transportation and sales portfolio will continue to be an asset that we leverage as we move forward. As a reminder, in the Northeast Appalachia, we have built an outstanding firm transportation portfolio that allows us to move our gas to multiple markets with volume and term flexibility.
Another way we are working to create Value+ in today's environment is by focusing on increasing our learnings from historical drilling and completion techniques and results. For example, our teams are redrilling wells on paper to identify improvement opportunities and fine-tune their geologic models to further increase the efficiency of future drilling activities. With these learnings, the company expects to further optimize our well economics and to add to shareholder value.
That concludes today's prepared comments. So we will now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

One, when we first went into the -- to West Virginia, our initial plans were to drill Utica wells in -- beginning in 2018 and begin to ramp that program at that time. You'll know that we've drilled a Utica well in a portion of our acreage. We have not completed it yet. And as we've ranked capital projects this year and prioritized them, we're keeping that one in mind on when we've actually completed. We have some additional Utica wells planned for other portions of our acreage that are set in the queue. And I think a lot of it really depends on where gas prices go, where liquids prices go and the balance between wet and dry Marcellus and Utica. And then we operate as a portfolio, so then you go up and look in the Northeast of Pennsylvania and the dry gas Marcellus area as well. So too early to tell in specific drilling schedule, but we have advanced the process from 2018 to sooner, just on a general basis because we've already made that one well test. The other thing that we're excited about is that we have for the area where we would put down the next Utica well series, when we get to that point, we have a dry gas solution in hand, and we're -- which would enable us to have that optionality to go in any of the particular areas we want to drill."

We have quite a bit of compression in Fayetteville across a very large gathering system but optimizing that and looking at any kind of constraints. But your specific question around where the biggest benefit was came from our Northeast operations, which is around compression, would it be in there. In addition, just I'll point out because we talked about this before, our renegotiations with Williams and our great new deal we have with them contributes to that as well."

And so we're watching those from a decline standpoint. There's some -- there was some industry concern about are you able to effectively produce the tail end of that lateral? We believe we are through a various combination of things, including dissolvable plugs, flow-through plugs, things like that. We think we're getting good contribution there. But as you recall from our earlier comments regarding overall productive strategy, the ability to have a tight landing zone control, the ability to have increased sand on completions and the ability to have managed drawdown were big factors, we believe, to outperformance from a well standpoint. So the longer laterals, we believe, we're able to produce those at a managed rate and get improved EURs.

Thanks for joining us on the call today, and your continued interest in Southwestern Energy Company. 
Earlier this year, we set out on a mission and articulated a clear set of objectives committing to reinforce our company, restore confidence and strengthen our bridge to resuming value adding growth as commodity prices and economics improve. We have delivered on these commitments here as you've seen over the past few months, we have been keenly focused on strengthening our balance sheet, including managing near-term maturities by pushing out a material amount of 2018 maturities to 2020, and have taken specific actions to reduce approximately $1.2 billion of debt through the sale of a portion of our long-dated undeveloped acreage and our very successful equity offering. Craig is going to discuss the details of this very successful deleveraging activity in a few minutes. 
In addition, we have continued to do what we do best, aggressively improve margin, both cost and performance, from our premier asset portfolio. We continue to drive costs out of the system and optimize our base production. The results of these efforts were evident in last night's release where you saw our strong quarterly results, including production, beating the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf equivalent. While the cost metrics came in below guidance. These achievements position the company to capture the benefits of a strengthening commodity price of that appears to be in process. Based on this strong operational performance and our high quality assets, improved commodity prices, a stronger balance sheet, including the preservation of our strong liquidity position and funds earmarked from our equity offering, we are reinitiating economic drilling and completion activities in each of our operating areas. These activities include completion of drilled but uncompleted wells and drilling of new wells, all meeting or exceeding our rigorous economic criteria. In fact, giving -- given our vertically integrated business model and only after the funds were secured, we have already resumed drilling activities much faster than we anticipated. Our first well, which was spud last weekend, reached TV in less than 4 days which is comparable to what we were doing 7 months ago when we halted drilling activities.
We plan to add want 1 to 2 rigs per month in -- across the company during the third quarter, demonstrating the speed and agility with which we can adjust our activity. Our well costs will also see the benefit of this vertical integration as the industry increases activity over time in response to the improved commodity prices. However, we plan to continue to evaluate and utilize both internal and external services as we ramp up activity and as economics dictate. Jack will walk through the detailed plan for Southwestern for the second half of 2016 in a moment which will have a material beneficial impact on 2017 and beyond.
While we've not communicated our 2017 plans, early indications show that we can invest in value adding economic projects resulting in production volumes flat year-over-year with a capital program of just $700 million in '17, given the optimization work underway and a higher capital efficiency in our go forward plans. Let me be clear, we will not chase uneconomic production growth. Each well we drill, each well we complete must meet our economic threshold of 1.3 PVI at current pricing before we drill. In line with our intent to invest within cash flow and drive continued improvement in the balance sheet, we will remain flexible and adjust activities accordingly as prices move.
A critical aspect of our commitment to financial discipline and an essential part of our forward investment plan is to take steps to assure our commodity price projections used in our economics for projects are realized. Consistent with our strategy to protect returns on our investment, to date, we have hedged just over 225 Bcf of our 2017 production, locking in a portion of our 2017 cash flow. 
With that, let me turn it over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the second quarter."

As Bill mentioned, we had a very strong quarter and successfully delivered on our commitments. Since the beginning of the year, we have consistently noted that strengthening the balance sheet is a core focus. We took significant steps and delivered steps in this area during the second quarter. 
The first step announced was the divestiture of long-dated acreage in West Virginia for $450 million. This acreage was scheduled to be developed in or after 2023, providing us with the opportunity to realize a strong purchase price with no appreciable near-term production or cash flow loss. The due diligence is progressing well and the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. Additionally, we announced the amendment and extension of our bank agreements which ensures significant liquidity availability through 2020. Our portfolio of premier assets and strong bank relationships made this amendment process possible despite the challenging lending environment currently facing the banks.
Combining the impacts of our bank transactions with our $1.25 billion equity offering and successful debt repurchase in July, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion in cash in addition to the undrawn $800 million from the revolving credit facilities. Pro forma for these transactions, our net debt balance was reduced to $3.2 billion, with debt maturities prior to 2020 reduced from $2 billion to $300 million. This is a very positive development for our credit and liquidity profile as it positions our balance sheet well to drive value from our outstanding assets. As we strengthen our balance sheet with these proactive steps, we are also taking steps to resume value adding growth as we resumed drilling and completion activity in the second half of 2016. We are committed to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and protecting our returns and have been actively hedging our remaining 2016 production as well as 2017. We have now hedged 93 Bcf of our remaining 2016 production at an average floor price of $2.57 per Mcf and approximately 228 Bcf of expected 2017 production at an average floor price of $3.01 per Mcf. These positions provide and our hedging program in general will provide protection on cash flows and include options that allow exposure to offset price movements. 
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results and increased capital program for the second half of the year."

As you saw in last night's release, in addition to the great financial achievements that Craig mentioned that we made in the second quarter, we also delivered excellent operational results. The quality of our acreage and the strength of our well performance continue to show as demonstrated by the second quarter production exceeding the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf while investing less than $15 million of drilling and completion capital during the quarter. With this strong portfolio performance, we are raising our 2016 production guidance by 45 Bcfe or 5% using midpoints. Almost 3 quarters of this improvement is attributable to our team's efforts to increase production from our existing wells.
Along with this impressive production performance, our aggressive assault on margin is continuing to reap benefits as our E&P costs which include lease operating expenses, general and administrative and taxes other than income taxes, decreased to $1.17 per Mcfe in the second quarter of '16 compared to $1.24 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2015. LOE costs for the quarter were again lower than our guidance range as the team's progress -- as the teams progress their efforts to identify efficiencies in the field. Our identified LOE cost savings for 2016 is now over $50 million, an increase of $10 million from savings that we discussed in our last call. These savings are in addition to the $35 million annual impact of the amended Williams agreement we've previously discussed. The incremental $10 million was primarily driven by efficiencies implemented around saltwater disposal and contracted services. We expect to leverage this focus on margin enhancement as we reinitiate our growing and completion activities.
As Bill mentioned earlier, we have already started our drilling and completion activities, and we anticipate 5 rigs running by the end of the third quarter: 2 in Northeast Appalachian, 2 in Southwest Appalachian and 1 in the Fayetteville. We expect to drill approximately 60 wells and place approximately 100 wells to sales on -- in the second half of this year, which includes our Utica well which we drilled in late 2015. While this additional activity will impact 2016 slightly with increased production, the real benefit of this comes in 2017 as we build the momentum of the portfolio and return to value-added growth.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we will now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

But if you go and look at wells that we've drilled in the last 12 months in the West Virginia or excuse me, Southwest Appalachia area, and expertly manage prior to us coming there, a lot of focus on good operatorship. We came in with a different concept and we drilled and completed wells, a number of them, across the acreage. We increased the sand loading substantially, we optimized where we landed the wells. In fact, we took the wells that were already drilled and drilled them on paper to figure out if you're going to redo it, how would you steer it. We used tools that weren't used on the first well. We upped the sand loading considerably. We managed the flowback on those wells to increase condensate yield and the ultimate EURs. And we drilled of those wells nearly or virtually 100% in the 15-foot targeted interval we had. So long way of saying we had a different concept and the wells are 40% or more, more productive and better EURs than the ones that were there when we got there. So much so that when we could go back to our reserves auditors and explain to them what we are doing, that was a-- we wanted to test it all the way through the system, so we are taking those learnings, applying them back into West -- to Pennsylvania and even into Fayetteville. There's no condensate yield or NGL yield in the other 2 divisions so that part doesn't apply. So hitting, putting stronger metrics in for being in zone 100% of the time changes, in our sand loading, changes in our flowback regime, elimination and debottlenecking of both the downhole equipment and the surface facilities are producing better wells and those kind of learnings are what we learn.

As I said in my kind of prepared remarks, we're going to economically evaluate our equipment and third parties, but directionally, when I look at the drilling rigs for example, our drilling rigs are handbuilt by us.

And so the likelihood of us using our own rigs to do that versus the cost of external rigs and the flexibility advantage we have by using our own, you put all that into the economics in our cost of drilling should stay right where they are continue to improve just because of our performance on the completion side. There's a part of the equation that's really huge here and it's utilization. And it is utilization in a place so that it becomes hyperefficient. And as we ramp-up, and we're are still working on this concept by the way, as we ramp up at this first initial pace, the numbers of wells, the numbers of completions to keep something, keep a team and a frac fleet, et cetera, fully utilized, lay heavily on the economic side.

This transitional phase we are working on it. So I don't see any changes in our drilling side costs in terms of moving them up.

And we -- NGL pricing has been under quite a bit of pressure for the last many months and we are seeing fundamentals show us that there are more, an uphill trend buoyed by specific fundamentals in each of the NGLs that enable us to see the opportunities to shift even on the fly from Northeast to West Virginia to capture that is available to us. So we do have a starting point. We're seeing some of the available or the fundamentals that may shift that as we go through these drilling projects. The second part of it is our available wells to be able to be drilled in from a permit perspective. So you keep an inventory of permitting -- permitted wells in each area, you watch acreage explorations, you watch a number of things. And so those are qualitative issues around the shift in economic or the specific economics. I believe that when you look at the longer-term drilling profile and you look at the pricing that we see, et cetera, more and more of our capital will go to this West Virginia area. Again, assuming that they're superior economics, which when -- as NGL pricing returns to some more -- a more fundamentally -- a market fundamentally-based pricing regime, we expect that, that will happen. The prospecting, all of that is there, so it's just really a matter of where do we get started and how do we get started. Another piece of this, the economics are again a big piece of this. We've positioned rigs back in December, January in place much, some might even on pads. Some of the initial drilling to complement the permits and the plans that were already there are the most efficient things to do as well."

In contrast to allocation for rig adds, it looks like the Fayetteville has actually seen the biggest blowdown of docks, at least at the end of this year, just looking at the guidance for drilled wells versus completions.

We're biased to the Northeast. Those are the investments we've made that we're waiting to capture the revenue associated with them. And so bringing that inventory down as low as we can makes economic sense and it makes practical sense. In the Northeast, let me stop for a second and make 1 another comment relative to docks in general. We don't drill wells -- we don't have a dock inventory for any other reason than to be efficient. We don't drill wells and hold them and wait on price or doing that kind of stuff. So as we build this restart plan and we're looking towards the Northeast, we need a certain inventory of docks to be efficient. There was a -- the initial view was let's go Northeast, let's do work there. In West Virginia, we weren't going to do as many wells, and so we could burn off some of our dock inventory because we didn't need as many to be efficient and that is -- that variable moves around all the time. And so it's an efficiency issue, it's a straight up economic issue, but in this case, at this moment in time, with clearing up excess inventory, you'll recall we came to a very abrupt halt. And so as you work off that inventory and get it down to where it needs to be, that's why they came out the way they did. And we've got about 100 across the company and most of Fayetteville's will be done, and many more West Virginia's will be done and we'll have Fayetteville's, or excuse me, Appalachia's towards the end of the year. But we end up at 60 [ph] year, so by the end of the year. And keep in mind, from an operational perspective, calendar years are only to do budgets. Operationally, we keep the machine flowing through the year. And part of our plan of this restart had 2017 in mind. And again, a continuous efficient, hyperefficient operating regime."

So we're -- this initial phase of restart related to docks is just putting the house from an abrupt start into an efficient mode again. If we're not drilling a bunch of wells in a particular area, we don't need a bunch of docks and we can monetize that cash flow coming back quickly. As we go into '17, my guess from a drilling and completions kind of overall priority will be more what I would call normal. First of all, highly constructed by economics and differentials and cash flow. We'll invest within cash flow, as I said earlier. We will prioritize where we go in how we do it based off of a reasonably smooth development plan, but one that is driven by economics and we will ashore of our confidence in that through a hedging program. And so you won't see some kind of opening, like we are starting over in '17 and doing a bunch of completions, you'll see us trend through the rest of this year.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today and your continued interest in Southwestern Energy Company. Earlier this year, we set out on a mission and articulated a clear set of objectives committing to reinforce",674,"Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today and your continued interest in Southwestern Energy Company. 
Earlier this year, we set out on a mission and articulated a clear set of objectives committing to reinforce our company, restore confidence and strengthen our bridge to resuming value-adding growth as commodity prices and economics improved. We have delivered on these commitments. As you've seen over the past few months, we have been keenly focused on strengthening our balance sheet, including managing near-term maturities, by pushing out a material amount of 2018 maturities to 2020 and have taken specific actions to reduce approximately $1.2 billion of debt through the sale of a portion of our long-dated undeveloped acreage and our very successful equity offering. Craig is going to discuss the details of this very successful deleveraging activity in a few minutes. 
In addition, we have continued to do what we do best, aggressively improve margin, both cost and performance, from our premier asset portfolio. We continue to drive cost out of the system and optimize our base production. The results of these efforts were evident in last night's release, where you saw our strong quarterly results, including production, beating the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf equivalent, while the cost metrics came in below guidance. These achievements position the company to capture the benefits of a strengthening commodity price that appears to be in process. Based on this strong operational performance and our high-quality assets; improved commodity prices; a stronger balance sheet, including the preservation of our strong liquidity position; and funds earmarked from our equity offering, we are reinitiating economic drilling and completion activities in each of our operating areas. These activities include completion of drilled but uncompleted wells and drilling of new wells, all meeting or exceeding our rigorous economic criteria. In fact, giving our -- given our vertically integrated business model and only after the funds were secured, we have already resumed drilling activities much faster than we anticipated. Our first well, which was spud last weekend, reached TD in less than 4 days, which is comparable to what we were doing 7 months ago when we halted drilling activities.
We plan to add one to 2 rigs per month in the -- across the company during the third quarter, demonstrating the speed and agility with which we can adjust our activity. Our well cost will also see the benefit of this vertical integration as the industry increases activity over time in response to the improved commodity prices. However, we plan to continue to evaluate and utilize both internal and external services as we ramp up activity and as economics dictate. Jack will walk through the detailed plan for Southwestern for the second half of 2016 in a moment, which will have a material beneficial impact on 2017 and beyond.
While we've not communicated our 2017 plans, early indications show that we can invest in value-adding economic projects, resulting in production volumes flat year-over-year with a capital program of just $700 million in '17, given the optimization work underway and the higher capital efficiency in our go-forward plans. Let me be clear. We will not chase uneconomic production growth. Each well we drill, each well we complete must meet our economic threshold of 1.3 PVI at current pricing before we drill. In line with our intent to invest within cash flow and drive continued improvement in the balance sheet, we will remain flexible and adjust activities accordingly as prices move.
A critical aspect of our commitment to financial discipline and an essential part of our forward investment plan is to take steps to assure our commodity price projections used in our economics for projects are realized. Consistent with our strategy to protect returns on our investment, to date, we have hedged just over 225 Bcf of our 2017 production, locking in a portion of our 2017 cash flow. 
With that, let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the second quarter."
304260,373739104,1010896,"Southwestern Energy Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Southwestern Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

As Bill mentioned, we had a very strong quarter and successfully delivered on our commitments. Since the beginning of the year, we have consistently noted that strengthening the balance sheet is a core focus. We took significant steps and delivered steps in this area during the second quarter. 
The first step announced was the divestiture of a long-dated acreage in West Virginia for $450 million. This acreage was scheduled to be developed in or after 2023, providing us with the opportunity to realize a strong purchase price with no appreciable near-term production or cash flow loss. The due diligence is progressing well, and the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. Additionally, we announced the amendment and extension of our bank agreements, which ensures significant liquidity availability through 2020. Our portfolio of premier assets and strong bank relationships made this amendment process possible despite the challenging lending environment currently facing the banks.
Combining the impacts of our bank transactions with our $1.25 billion equity offering and successful debt repurchase in July, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion in cash in addition to the undrawn $800 million from the revolving credit facilities. Pro forma for these transactions, our net debt balance was reduced to $3.2 billion, with debt maturities prior to 2020 reduced from $2 billion to $300 million. This is a very positive development for our credit and liquidity profile as it positions our balance sheet well to drive value from our outstanding assets. As we strengthen our balance sheet with these proactive steps, we are also taking steps to resume value-adding growth as we resume drilling and completion activity in the second half of 2016. We are committed to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and protecting our returns and have been actively hedging our remaining 2016 production as well as 2017. We have now hedged 93 Bcf of our remaining 2016 production at an average floor price of $2.57 per Mcf and approximately 228 Bcf of expected 2017 production at an average floor price of $3.01 per Mcf. These positions provide -- and our hedging program in general will provide protection on cash flows and include options that allow exposure to upside price movements. 
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results and increased capital program for the second half of the year."

As you saw in last night's release, in addition to the great financial achievements that Craig mentioned that we made in the second quarter, we also delivered excellent operational results. The quality of our acreage and the strength of our well performance continue to show, as demonstrated by the second quarter production exceeding the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf while investing less than $15 million of drilling and completion capital during the quarter. With this strong portfolio performance, we are raising our 2016 production guidance by 45 Bcfe or 5% using midpoints. Almost 3 quarters of this improvement is attributable to our team's efforts to increase production from our existing wells.
Along with this impressive production performance, our aggressive assault on margin is continuing to reap benefits as our E&P costs, which include lease operating expenses, general and administrative and taxes other than income taxes, decreased to $1.17 per Mcfe in the second quarter of '16 compared to $1.24 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2015. LOE costs for the quarter were again lower than our guidance range as the team's progress -- as the teams progress their efforts to identify efficiencies in the field. Our identified LOE cost savings for 2016 is now over $50 million, an increase of $10 million from savings that we discussed in our last call. These savings are in addition to the $35 million annual impact of the amended Williams agreement we previously discussed. The incremental $10 million was primarily driven by efficiencies implemented around saltwater disposal and contracted services. We expect to leverage this focus on margin enhancement as we reinitiate our drilling and completion activities.
As Bill mentioned earlier, we have already started our drilling and completion activities, and we anticipate 5 rigs running by the end of the third quarter: 2 in Northeast Appalachia, 2 in Southwest Appalachia and one in the Fayetteville. We expect to drill approximately 60 wells and place approximately 100 wells to sales on -- in the second half of this year, which includes our Utica well, which we drilled in late 2015. While this additional activity will impact 2016 slightly with increased production, the real benefit of this comes in 2017 as we build the momentum of the portfolio and return to value-added growth.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we will now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

Is the $700 million that you referred to, is that just D&C CapEx? Or is that total CapEx? And then if you could drill in a little bit more on the comment of being flat year-over-year. The way I look at it, if you're going to be flat year-over-year, you'd actually probably have to resume growth quarter-over-quarter, sequential growth, sometime in early 2017. Is that the right read on that?"

Our previous guidance was that for about that much capital, again, all in, we could achieve a -- year-end '16 to year-end '17, you'd end up in the same -- where you started, but that had a decline built into it because it's a U-shaped kind of production profile. With this -- with us reinitiating drilling and completions -- and remember, we're doing a number of our DUCs, and we're going to talk about that later, some of our DUCs and drilling new wells, we accelerate that progression. Or another way to look at it, you flatten out the trough of decline. So yes, you're going to have -- we have to turn it. We'll turn it early in the year probably rather than waiting until sometime mid- to late year to do that. And so it's -- we wanted to kind of compare something that we'd put out before, which was at about $700 million, instead of it being exit-to-exit is now full year-on-full year flat. And so you are correct. As we enter the second half of next year, you get on that growth ramp, assuming that we -- again, assuming that's the number.

And then whether the projections forward apply to the whole company or not, I think we're still working on that. But if you go and look at wells that we drilled in the last 12 months in the West Virginia -- or excuse me, Southwest Appalachia area and expertly managed prior to us coming there, a lot of focus on good operatorship, we came in with a different concept. And we drilled and completed wells, a number of them, across the acreage. We increased the sand loading substantially. We optimized where we landed the wells. In fact, we took the wells that were already drilled and drilled them on paper to figure out if you were going to redo it, how would you steer it. We used tools that weren't used on the first well. We upped the sand loading considerably. We managed the flowback on those wells to increase condensate yield and the ultimate EURs. And we drilled those wells nearly or virtually 100% in the 15-foot targeted interval we had. So long way of saying we had a different concept, and the wells are 40% or more, more productive and better EURs than the ones that were there when we got there. So much so that when we could go back to our reserves auditors and explain to them what we are doing, that was a -- we wanted to test it all the way through the system. So we are taking those learnings, applying them back into West -- to Pennsylvania and even into Fayetteville. There's no condensate yield or NGL yield in the other 2 divisions, so that part doesn't apply. But hitting -- putting stronger metrics in for being in-zone 100% of the time, changes in our sand loading, changes in our flowback regime, elimination and debottlenecking of both the downhole equipment and the surface facilities are producing better wells, and those kind of learnings are what we've learned.

As I've said in my kind of prepared remarks, we're going to economically evaluate our equipment and third parties. But directionally, when I look at the drilling rigs, for example, our drilling rigs are handbuilt by us. I mean, we -- in terms of picking all the pieces, we've got extraordinary employees that are compensated as employees that are drilling these wells and doing an incredible job. And so the likelihood of us using our own rigs to do that versus the cost of external rigs and the flexibility advantage we have by using our own, you put all that in the economics, and our costs on drilling should stay right where they are or continue to improve just because of our performance. On the completion side, there's a part of the equation that's really huge here, and it's utilization. And it is utilization in a place so that it becomes hyperefficient. And as we ramp up -- and we're are still working on this concept, by the way. As we ramp up at this first initial pace, the numbers of wells, the numbers of completions to keep something, keep a team and a frac fleet, et cetera, fully utilized, lay heavily on the economic side. If you use them half-time, you got to charge yourself quite a bit more. If you're not -- if you use them full time, you can compete. We can compete with anyone, and we have. This transitional phase, we're working on it. So I don't see any changes in our drilling side costs in terms of moving them up. We've worked with a lot of our suppliers and have put in place agreements for as long as 18 months to try to enable them to get back to work, but enable us to save cost and keep our costs in check.

But on a pumping services side, that is something we consider as protection against those higher prices, if they come, that will be utilized and ours, again, with the utilization Bill mentioned.

One of the key drivers is the variability on liquids pricing and the assumptions that we make and then what we -- where we see the market. And we -- NGL pricing has been under quite a bit of pressure for the last many months, and we are seeing fundamentals show us that there are more -- an uphill trend buoyed by specific fundamentals in each of the NGLs that enable us to see the opportunities to shift on -- even on the fly from Northeast to West Virginia to capture that is available to us. So we have to have a starting point. We're seeing some of the available -- or the fundamentals that may shift that as we go through these drilling projects. The second part of it is our available wells to be able to be drilled in -- from a permit perspective. So you keep an inventory of permitting -- permitted wells in each area. You watch acreage explorations. You watch a number of things. And so those are qualitative issues around the shift in economic -- or the specific economics. I believe that when you look at the longer-term drilling profile and you look at the pricing that we see, et cetera, more and more of our capital will go to this West Virginia area. Again, assuming that they're superior economics, which when -- as NGL pricing returns to some more -- a more -- a market fundamentally based pricing regime, we expect that, that will happen. The capacity, processing, all of that is there, so it's just really a matter of where do we get started and how do we get started. Another piece of this, economics are, again, a big piece of this. We've positioned rigs back in December, January in plays much less -- some even on pads. And some of the initial drilling to complement the permits and the plans that were already there are the most efficient things to do as well."

In contrast to the allocation for rig adds, it looks like the Fayetteville has actually seen the biggest blowdown of DUCs, at least to the end of this year, just looking at the guidance for drilled wells versus completions.

We're biased to the Northeast. Those are investments we've made that are waiting to capture the revenue associated with them. And so bringing that inventory down as low as we can makes economic sense, and it makes practical sense. In the Northeast -- let me stop for a second and make one other comment relative to DUCs in general. We don't drill -- we don't have a DUC inventory for any other reason than to be efficient. We don't drill wells and hold them and wait on price or doing that kind of stuff. So as we built this restart plan and we're looking towards the Northeast, we need a certain inventory of DUCs to be efficient. There was a -- the initial view was, ""Let's go to Northeast, let's do work there."" In West Virginia, we weren't going to do as many wells, and so we could burn off some of our DUC inventory because we didn't need as many to be as efficient. And that is -- that variable moves around all the time. And so it's an efficiency issue. It's a straight-up economic issue. But in this case, at this moment in time, with clearing up excess inventory, you'll recall we came to a very abrupt halt. And so as you work off that inventory and get it down to where it needs to be, that's why they came out the way they did. And we've got about 100 across the company and most of Fayettevilles will be done, and many more West Virginias will be done, and we'll have Fayettevilles -- or excuse me, Appalachias towards the end of the year. But we end up at 60-or-so by the end of the year. And keep in mind, from an operational perspective, we -- calendar years are only to do budgets. Operationally, we keep the machine flowing through the year. Part of our plan of this restart had 2017 in mind. And again, a continuous efficient -- hyperefficient operating regime."

One, the statement I made before, DUCs are an efficiency improvement tool for us more than a pile of a bunch of DUCs and wait for price to get better and then move them off. So we're -- this initial phase of restart related to DUCs is just putting the house from an abrupt start into an efficient mode again. If we're not drilling a bunch of wells in a particular area, we don't need a bunch of DUCs. And we can monetize those and get cash flow coming back quickly. As we go into '17, my guess from a drilling and completions kind of overall priority will be more what we -- what I would call normal. First of all, highly instructed by economics and differentials and cash flow. We'll invest within cash flow, as I said earlier. We'll prioritize where we go and how we do it based off of a reasonably smooth development plan, but one that is driven by economics. And we will shore up our confidence in that through a hedging program. And so you'll -- you won't see some kind of opening like we're starting over in '17 and doing a bunch of completions.

Thanks for joining us on the call today and your continued interest in Southwestern Energy Company. 
Earlier this year, we set out on a mission and articulated a clear set of objectives committing to reinforce our company, restore confidence and strengthen our bridge to resuming value-adding growth as commodity prices and economics improved. We have delivered on these commitments. As you've seen over the past few months, we have been keenly focused on strengthening our balance sheet, including managing near-term maturities, by pushing out a material amount of 2018 maturities to 2020 and have taken specific actions to reduce approximately $1.2 billion of debt through the sale of a portion of our long-dated undeveloped acreage and our very successful equity offering. Craig is going to discuss the details of this very successful deleveraging activity in a few minutes. 
In addition, we have continued to do what we do best, aggressively improve margin, both cost and performance, from our premier asset portfolio. We continue to drive cost out of the system and optimize our base production. The results of these efforts were evident in last night's release, where you saw our strong quarterly results, including production, beating the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf equivalent, while the cost metrics came in below guidance. These achievements position the company to capture the benefits of a strengthening commodity price that appears to be in process. Based on this strong operational performance and our high-quality assets; improved commodity prices; a stronger balance sheet, including the preservation of our strong liquidity position; and funds earmarked from our equity offering, we are reinitiating economic drilling and completion activities in each of our operating areas. These activities include completion of drilled but uncompleted wells and drilling of new wells, all meeting or exceeding our rigorous economic criteria. In fact, giving our -- given our vertically integrated business model and only after the funds were secured, we have already resumed drilling activities much faster than we anticipated. Our first well, which was spud last weekend, reached TD in less than 4 days, which is comparable to what we were doing 7 months ago when we halted drilling activities.
We plan to add 1 to 2 rigs per month in the -- across the company during the third quarter, demonstrating the speed and agility with which we can adjust our activity. Our well costs will also see the benefit of this vertical integration as the industry increases activity over time in response to the improved commodity prices. However, we plan to continue to evaluate and utilize both internal and external services as we ramp up activity and as economics dictate. Jack will walk through the detailed plan for Southwestern for the second half of 2016 in a moment, which will have a material beneficial impact on 2017 and beyond.
While we've not communicated our 2017 plans, early indications show that we can invest in value-adding economic projects, resulting in production volumes flat year-over-year with a capital program of just $700 million in '17, given the optimization work underway and the higher capital efficiency in our go-forward plans. Let me be clear. We will not chase uneconomic production growth. Each well we drill, each well we complete, must meet our economic threshold of 1.3 PVI at current pricing before we drill. In line with our intent to invest within cash flow and drive continued improvement in the balance sheet, we will remain flexible and adjust activities accordingly as prices move.
A critical aspect of our commitment to financial discipline and an essential part of our forward investment plan is to take steps to assure our commodity price projections used in our economics for projects are realized. Consistent with our strategy to protect returns on our investment, to date, we have hedged just over 225 Bcf of our 2017 production, locking in a portion of our 2017 cash flow. 
With that, let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the second quarter."
304260,373739104,1011026,"Southwestern Energy Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Southwestern Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

As Bill mentioned, we had a very strong quarter and successfully delivered on our commitments. Since the beginning of the year, we have consistently noted that strengthening the balance sheet is a core focus. We took significant steps and deliberate steps in this area during the second quarter. 
The first step announced was the divestiture of a long-dated acreage in West Virginia for $450 million. This acreage was scheduled to be developed in or after 2023, providing us with the opportunity to realize a strong purchase price with no appreciable near-term production or cash flow loss. The due diligence is progressing well, and the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. Additionally, we announced the amendment and extension of our bank agreements, which ensures significant liquidity availability through 2020. Our portfolio of premier assets and strong bank relationships made this amendment process possible despite the challenging lending environment currently facing the banks.
Combining the impacts of our bank transactions with our $1.25 billion equity offering and successful debt repurchase in July, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion in cash in addition to the undrawn $800 million from the revolving credit facilities. Pro forma for these transactions, our net debt balance was reduced to $3.2 billion, with debt maturities prior to 2020 reduced from $2 billion to $300 million. This is a very positive development for our credit and liquidity profile as it positions our balance sheet well to drive value from our outstanding assets. As we strengthen our balance sheet with these proactive steps, we are also taking steps to resume value-adding growth as we resume drilling and completion activity in the second half of 2016. We are committed to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and protecting our returns and have been actively hedging our remaining 2016 production as well as 2017. We have now hedged 93 Bcf of our remaining 2016 production at an average floor price of $2.57 per Mcf and approximately 228 Bcf of expected 2017 production at an average floor price of $3.01 per Mcf. These positions provide -- and our hedging program in general will provide protection on cash flows and include options that allow exposure to upside price movements. 
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results and increased capital program for the second half of the year."

As you saw in last night's release, in addition to the great financial achievements that Craig mentioned that we made in the second quarter, we also delivered excellent operational results. The quality of our acreage and the strength of our well performance continue to show, as demonstrated by the second quarter production exceeding the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf while investing less than $15 million of drilling and completion capital during the quarter. With this strong portfolio performance, we are raising our 2016 production guidance by 45 Bcfe or 5% using midpoints. Almost 3/4 of this improvement is attributable to our team's efforts to increase production from our existing wells.
Along with this impressive production performance, our aggressive assault on margin is continuing to reap benefits as our E&P costs, which include lease operating expenses, general and administrative and taxes other than income taxes, decreased to $1.17 per Mcfe in the second quarter of '16 compared to $1.24 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2015. LOE costs for the quarter were again lower than our guidance range as the team's progress -- as the teams progress their efforts to identify efficiencies in the field. Our identified LOE cost savings for 2016 is now over $50 million, an increase of $10 million from savings that we discussed in our last call. These savings are in addition to the $35 million annual impact of the amended Williams agreement we previously discussed. The incremental $10 million was primarily driven by efficiencies implemented around saltwater disposal and contracted services. We expect to leverage this focus on margin enhancement as we reinitiate our drilling and completion activities.
As Bill mentioned earlier, we have already started our drilling and completion activities, and we anticipate 5 rigs running by the end of the third quarter: 2 in Northeast Appalachia, 2 in Southwest Appalachia and one in the Fayetteville. We expect to drill approximately 60 wells and place approximately 100 wells to sales on -- in the second half of this year, which includes our Utica well, which we drilled in late 2015. While this additional activity will impact 2016 slightly with increased production, the real benefit of this comes in 2017 as we build the momentum of the portfolio and return to value-added growth.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we will now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

We'll turn it early in the year probably rather than waiting until sometime mid- to late year to do that. And so it's -- we wanted to kind of compare something that we'd put out before, which was at about $700 million, instead of it being exit-to-exit, it is now full year-on-full year flat. And so you are correct. As we enter the second half of next year, you get on that growth ramp, assuming that we -- again, assuming that's the number. We haven't done our capital budget, and -- but we guided on that before, so we just wanted to make it -- connect the dots for you."

And then whether the projections forward apply to the whole company or not, I think we're still working on that. But if you go and look at wells that we drilled in the last 12 months in the West Virginia -- or excuse me, Southwest Appalachia area and expertly managed prior to us coming there, a lot of focus on good operatorship, we came in with a different concept. And we drilled and completed wells, a number of them, across the acreage. We increased the sand loading substantially. We optimized where we landed the wells. In fact, we took the wells that were already drilled and drilled them on paper to figure out if you were going to redo it, how would you steer it. We used tools that weren't used on the first wells. We upped the sand loading considerably. We managed the flowback on those wells to increase condensate yield and the ultimate EURs. And we drilled those wells nearly or virtually 100% in the 15-foot targeted interval we had. So long way of saying, we had a different concept, and the wells are 40% or more, more productive and better EURs than the ones that were there when we got there. So much so that when we could go back to our reserves auditors and explain to them what we are doing, that was a -- we wanted to test it all the way through the system. So we are taking those learnings, applying them back into West -- to Pennsylvania and even into Fayetteville. There's no condensate yield or NGL yield in the other 2 divisions, so that part doesn't apply. But hitting -- putting stronger metrics in for being in-zone 100% of the time, changes in our sand loading, changes in our flowback regime, elimination and debottlenecking of both the downhole equipment and the surface facilities are producing better wells, and those kind of learnings are what we've learned.

Jack can kind of go into a couple of percentages. Let me just touch on a couple of things. As I've said in my kind of prepared remarks, we're going to economically evaluate our equipment and third parties. But directionally, when I look at the drilling rigs, for example, our drilling rigs are hand built by us. I mean, we -- in terms of picking all the pieces, we've got extraordinary employees that are compensated as employees that are drilling these wells and doing an incredible job. And so the likelihood of us using our own rigs to do that versus the cost of external rigs and the flexibility advantage we have by using our own, you put all that into economics, and our costs on drilling should stay right where they are or continue to improve just because of our performance. On the completion side, there's a part of the equation that's really huge here, and it's utilization. And it is utilization in a place so that it becomes hyper efficient. And as we ramp up -- and we're are still working on this concept, by the way. As we ramp up at this first initial pace, the numbers of wells, the numbers of completions to keep something, keep a team and a frac fleet, et cetera, fully utilized, weigh heavily on the economic side. If you're using them half-time, you got to charge yourself quite a bit more. If you're not -- if you're using them full time, you can compete. We can compete with anyone, and we have. This transitional phase, we're working on it. So I don't see any changes in our drilling side costs in terms of moving them up. We've worked with a lot of our suppliers and have put in place agreements for as long as 18 months to try to enable them to get back to work, but enable us to save cost and keep our costs in check.

It is considerably less right now. One of the reasons, vertically integrated, as Bill said about drilling rigs, we expect to use our drilling rigs mainly. But on a pumping services side, that is something we consider as protection against those higher prices, if they come, that will be utilized and ours, again, with the utilization Bill mentioned.

Nothing that we feel like we have to do something immediately, but we'll continue to look at the balance sheet, whether it's '18 or any other debt that we have for paydown potentially."

One of the key drivers is the variability on liquids pricing and the assumptions that we make and then what we -- where we see the market. And we -- NGL pricing has been under quite a bit of pressure for the last many months, and we are seeing fundamentals show us that there are more -- an uphill trend buoyed by specific fundamentals in each of the NGLs that enable us to see the opportunities to shift on -- even on the fly from Northeast to West Virginia to capture that is available to us. So we had to have a starting point. We're seeing some of the available -- or the fundamentals that may shift that as we go through these drilling projects. The second part of it is our available wells to be able to be drilled in -- from a permit perspective. So you keep an inventory of permitting -- permitted wells in each area. You watch acreage explorations. You watch a number of things. And so those are qualitative issues around the shift in economic -- or the specific economics. I believe that when you look at the longer-term drilling profile and you look at the pricing that we see, et cetera, more and more of our capital will go to this West Virginia area. Again, assuming that they're superior economics, which when -- as NGL pricing returns to some more -- a more -- a market fundamentally based pricing regime, we expect that, that will happen. The capacity, processing, all of that is there, so it's just really a matter of where do we get started and how do we get started. Another piece of this, economics are, again, a big piece of this. We've positioned rigs back in December, January in plays much less -- some even on pads. And some of the initial drilling to complement the permits and the plans that were already there are the most efficient things to do as well."

In contrast to the allocation for rig adds, it looks like the Fayetteville has actually seen the biggest blowdown of DUCs, at least to the end of this year, just looking at the guidance for drilled wells versus completions.

We're biased to the Northeast. Those are investments we've made that are waiting to capture the revenue associated with them. And so bringing that inventory down as low as we can makes economic sense, and it makes practical sense. In the Northeast -- let me stop for a second and make one other comment relative to DUCs in general. We don't drill -- we don't have a DUC inventory for any other reason than to be efficient. We don't drill wells and hold them and wait on price or do any of that kind of stuff. So as we built this restart plan and we're looking towards the Northeast, we need a certain inventory of DUCs to be efficient. There was a -- the initial view was, ""Let's go to Northeast, let's do work there."" In West Virginia, we weren't going to do as many wells, and so we could burn off some of our DUC inventory because we didn't need as many to be as efficient. And that is -- that variable moves around all the time. And so it's an efficiency issue. It's a straight-up economic issue. But in this case, at this moment in time, with clearing up excess inventory, you'll recall we came to a very abrupt halt. And so as you work off that inventory and get it down to where it needs to be, that's why they came out the way they did. And we've got about 100 across the company and most of Fayettevilles will be done, and many more West Virginias will be done, and we'll have Fayettevilles -- or excuse me, Appalachias towards the end of the year. But we end up at 60-or-so by the end of the year. And keep in mind, from an operational perspective, we -- calendar years are only to do budgets. Operationally, we keep the machine flowing through the year. Part of our plan of this restart had 2017 in mind. And again, a continuous efficient -- hyper efficient operating regime."

One, the statement I made before, DUCs are an efficiency improvement tool for us more than a pile of a bunch of DUCs and wait for price to get better and then move them off. So we're -- this initial phase of restart related to DUCs is just putting the house from an abrupt start into an efficient mode again. If we're not drilling a bunch of wells in a particular area, we don't need a bunch of DUCs. And we can monetize those and get cash flow coming back quickly. As we go into '17, my guess from a drilling and completions kind of overall priority will be more what we -- what I would call normal. First of all, highly instructed by economics and differentials and cash flow. We'll invest within cash flow, as I said earlier. We'll prioritize where we go and how we do it based off of a reasonably smooth development plan, but one that is driven by economics. And we will shore up our confidence in that through a hedging program. And so you'll -- you won't see some kind of opening like we're starting over in '17 and doing a bunch of completions.

Thanks for joining us on the call today and your continued interest in Southwestern Energy Company. 
Earlier this year, we set out on a mission and articulated a clear set of objectives committing to reinforce our company, restore confidence and strengthen our bridge to resuming value-adding growth as commodity prices and economics improved. We have delivered on these commitments. As you've seen over the past few months, we have been keenly focused on strengthening our balance sheet, including managing near-term maturities, by pushing out a material amount of 2018 maturities to 2020 and have taken specific actions to reduce approximately $1.2 billion of debt through the sale of a portion of our long-dated undeveloped acreage and our very successful equity offering. Craig is going to discuss the details of this very successful deleveraging activity in a few minutes. 
In addition, we have continued to do what we do best, aggressively improve margin, both cost and performance, from our premier asset portfolio. We continue to drive cost out of the system and optimize our base production. The results of these efforts were evident in last night's release, where you saw our strong quarterly results, including production, beating the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf equivalent, while the cost metrics came in below guidance. These achievements position the company to capture the benefits of a strengthening commodity price that appears to be in process. Based on this strong operational performance and our high-quality assets; improved commodity prices; a stronger balance sheet, including the preservation of our strong liquidity position; and funds earmarked from our equity offering, we are reinitiating economic drilling and completion activities in each of our operating areas. These activities include completion of drilled but uncompleted wells and drilling of new wells, all meeting or exceeding our rigorous economic criteria. In fact, giving our -- given our vertically integrated business model and only after the funds were secured, we have already resumed drilling activities much faster than we anticipated. Our first well, which was spud last weekend, reached TD in less than 4 days, which is comparable to what we were doing 7 months ago when we halted drilling activities.
We plan to add 1 to 2 rigs per month in the -- across the company during the third quarter, demonstrating the speed and agility with which we can adjust our activity. Our well costs will also see the benefit of this vertical integration as the industry increases activity over time in response to the improved commodity prices. However, we plan to continue to evaluate and utilize both internal and external services as we ramp up activity and as economics dictate. Jack will walk through the detailed plan for Southwestern for the second half of 2016 in a moment, which will have a material beneficial impact on 2017 and beyond.
While we've not communicated our 2017 plans, early indications show that we can invest in value-adding economic projects, resulting in production volumes flat year-over-year with a capital program of just $700 million in '17, given the optimization work underway and the higher capital efficiency in our go-forward plans. Let me be clear. We will not chase uneconomic production growth. Each well we drill, each well we complete, must meet our economic threshold of 1.3 PVI at current pricing before we drill. In line with our intent to invest within cash flow and drive continued improvement in the balance sheet, we will remain flexible and adjust activities accordingly as prices move.
A critical aspect of our commitment to financial discipline and an essential part of our forward investment plan is to take steps to assure our commodity price projections used in our economics for projects are realized. Consistent with our strategy to protect returns on our investment, to date, we have hedged just over 225 Bcf of our 2017 production, locking in a portion of our 2017 cash flow. 
With that, let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the second quarter."
304260,373739104,1011169,"Southwestern Energy Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Southwestern Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

As Bill mentioned, we had a very strong quarter and successfully delivered on our commitments. Since the beginning of the year, we have consistently noted that strengthening the balance sheet is a core focus. We took significant steps and deliberate steps in this area during the second quarter. 
The first step announced was the divestiture of a long-dated acreage in West Virginia for $450 million. This acreage was scheduled to be developed in or after 2023, providing us with the opportunity to realize a strong purchase price with no appreciable near-term production or cash flow loss. The due diligence is progressing well, and the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. Additionally, we announced the amendment and extension of our bank agreements, which ensures significant liquidity availability through 2020. Our portfolio of premier assets and strong bank relationships made this amendment process possible despite the challenging lending environment currently facing the banks.
Combining the impacts of our bank transactions with our $1.25 billion equity offering and successful debt repurchase in July, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion in cash in addition to the undrawn $800 million from the revolving credit facilities. Pro forma for these transactions, our net debt balance was reduced to $3.2 billion, with debt maturities prior to 2020 reduced from $2 billion to $300 million. This is a very positive development for our credit and liquidity profile as it positions our balance sheet well to drive value from our outstanding assets. As we strengthen our balance sheet with these proactive steps, we are also taking steps to resume value-adding growth as we resume drilling and completion activity in the second half of 2016. We are committed to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and protecting our returns and have been actively hedging our remaining 2016 production as well as 2017. We have now hedged 93 Bcf of our remaining 2016 production at an average floor price of $2.57 per Mcf and approximately 228 Bcf of expected 2017 production at an average floor price of $3.01 per Mcf. These positions provide -- and our hedging program in general will provide protection on cash flows and include options that allow exposure to upside price movements. 
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results and increased capital program for the second half of the year."

As you saw in last night's release, in addition to the great financial achievements that Craig mentioned that we made in the second quarter, we also delivered excellent operational results. The quality of our acreage and the strength of our well performance continue to show, as demonstrated by the second quarter production exceeding the top end of guidance by 10 Bcf while investing less than $15 million of drilling and completion capital during the quarter. With this strong portfolio performance, we are raising our 2016 production guidance by 45 Bcfe or 5% using midpoints. Almost 3/4 of this improvement is attributable to our team's efforts to increase production from our existing wells.
Along with this impressive production performance, our aggressive assault on margin is continuing to reap benefits as our E&P costs, which include lease operating expenses, general and administrative and taxes other than income taxes, decreased to $1.17 per Mcfe in the second quarter of '16 compared to $1.24 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2015. LOE costs for the quarter were again lower than our guidance range as the team's progress -- as the teams progress their efforts to identify efficiencies in the field. Our identified LOE cost savings for 2016 is now over $50 million, an increase of $10 million from savings that we discussed in our last call. These savings are in addition to the $35 million annual impact of the amended Williams agreement we previously discussed. The incremental $10 million was primarily driven by efficiencies implemented around saltwater disposal and contracted services. We expect to leverage this focus on margin enhancement as we reinitiate our drilling and completion activities.
As Bill mentioned earlier, we have already started our drilling and completion activities, and we anticipate 5 rigs running by the end of the third quarter: 2 in Northeast Appalachia, 2 in Southwest Appalachia and one in the Fayetteville. We expect to drill approximately 60 wells and place approximately 100 wells to sales on -- in the second half of this year, which includes our Utica well, which we drilled in late 2015. While this additional activity will impact 2016 slightly with increased production, the real benefit of this comes in 2017 as we build the momentum of the portfolio and return to value-added growth.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we will now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

That's one of the reasons we were able to immediately get back on curve. Everything didn't go perfect on that well, but yet, we still were right on pace with what we did in the past. We've also looked at every one of our completions that have basically gone to engineered completions as far as looking at how much is in-zone, completing it, completing the work that's in-zone and have spent a lot of time looking at how we could -- more sand placement.

And then whether the projections forward apply to the whole company or not, I think we're still working on that. But if you go and look at wells that we drilled in the last 12 months in the West Virginia -- or excuse me, Southwest Appalachia area and expertly managed prior to us coming there, a lot of focus on good operatorship, we came in with a different concept. And we drilled and completed wells, a number of them, across the acreage. We increased the sand loading substantially. We optimized where we landed the wells. In fact, we took the wells that were already drilled and drilled them on paper to figure out if you were going to redo it, how would you steer it. We used tools that weren't used on the first wells. We upped the sand loading considerably. We managed the flowback on those wells to increase condensate yield and the ultimate EURs. And we drilled those wells nearly or virtually 100% in the 15-foot targeted interval we had. So long way of saying, we had a different concept, and the wells are 40% or more, more productive and better EURs than the ones that were there when we got there. So much so that when we could go back to our reserves auditors and explain to them what we are doing, that was a -- we wanted to test it all the way through the system. So we are taking those learnings, applying them back into West -- to Pennsylvania and even into Fayetteville. There's no condensate yield or NGL yield in the other 2 divisions, so that part doesn't apply. But hitting -- putting stronger metrics in for being in-zone 100% of the time, changes in our sand loading, changes in our flowback regime, elimination and debottlenecking of both the downhole equipment and the surface facilities are producing better wells, and those kind of learnings are what we've learned. And then we project those into our going-forward estimates where we can substantiate them."

Jack can kind of go into a couple of percentages. Let me just touch on a couple of things. As I've said in my kind of prepared remarks, we're going to economically evaluate our equipment and third parties. But directionally, when I look at the drilling rigs, for example, our drilling rigs are hand built by us. I mean, we -- in terms of picking all the pieces, we've got extraordinary employees that are compensated as employees that are drilling these wells and doing an incredible job. And so the likelihood of us using our own rigs to do that versus the cost of external rigs and the flexibility advantage we have by using our own, you put all that into economics, and our costs on drilling should stay right where they are or continue to improve just because of our performance. On the completion side, there's a part of the equation that's really huge here, and it's utilization. And it is utilization in a place so that it becomes hyper efficient. And as we ramp up -- and we're are still working on this concept, by the way. As we ramp up at this first initial pace, the numbers of wells, the numbers of completions to keep something, keep a team and a frac fleet, et cetera, fully utilized, weigh heavily on the economic side. If you're using them half-time, you got to charge yourself quite a bit more. If you're not -- if you're using them full time, you can compete. We can compete with anyone, and we have. This transitional phase, we're working on it. So I don't see any changes in our drilling side costs in terms of moving them up. We've worked with a lot of our suppliers and have put in place agreements for as long as 18 months to try to enable them to get back to work, but enable us to save cost and keep our costs in check.

It is considerably less right now. One of the reasons, vertically integrated, as Bill said about drilling rigs, we expect to use our drilling rigs mainly. But on a pumping services side, that is something we consider as protection against those higher prices, if they come, that will be utilized and ours, again, with the utilization Bill mentioned. As that goes, our pumping services will be able to supplant if prices get out of hand. So we think that's a little bit of a hedge that we're protected. Currently..."

I'd like to approach the question -- some of the questions regarding the rigs in a slightly different way, but one that you've always been pretty consistent about. Slide 17 of the current corporate presentation shows that Southwest Appalachia has far more economic locations at $3 nat gas than the Fayetteville or Northeast Appalachia combined. So I was wondering, what are the drivers that are putting 60% of your rigs in those plays instead of more rigs into Southwest Appalachia?"

One of the key drivers is the variability on liquids pricing and the assumptions that we make and then what we -- where we see the market. And we -- NGL pricing has been under quite a bit of pressure for the last many months, and we are seeing fundamentals show us that there are more -- an uphill trend buoyed by specific fundamentals in each of the NGLs that enable us to see the opportunities to shift on -- even on the fly from Northeast to West Virginia to capture that is available to us. So we had to have a starting point. We're seeing some of the available -- or the fundamentals that may shift that as we go through these drilling projects. The second part of it is our available wells to be able to be drilled in -- from a permit perspective. So you keep an inventory of permitting -- permitted wells in each area. You watch acreage explorations. You watch a number of things. And so those are qualitative issues around the shift in economic -- or the specific economics. I believe that when you look at the longer-term drilling profile and you look at the pricing that we see, et cetera, more and more of our capital will go to this West Virginia area. Again, assuming that they're superior economics, which when -- as NGL pricing returns to some more -- a more -- a market fundamentally based pricing regime, we expect that, that will happen. The capacity, processing, all of that is there, so it's just really a matter of where do we get started and how do we get started. Another piece of this, economics are, again, a big piece of this. We've positioned rigs back in December, January in plays much less -- some even on pads. And some of the initial drilling to complement the permits and the plans that were already there are the most efficient things to do as well."

In contrast to the allocation for rig adds, it looks like the Fayetteville has actually seen the biggest blowdown of DUCs, at least to the end of this year, just looking at the guidance for drilled wells versus completions. The Northeast, in comparison, looks to be building a bit potentially or at least staying flat. Does that speak to your view on Northeast bases entering next year?

We're biased to the Northeast. Those are investments we've made that are waiting to capture the revenue associated with them. And so bringing that inventory down as low as we can makes economic sense, and it makes practical sense. In the Northeast -- let me stop for a second and make one other comment relative to DUCs in general. We don't drill -- we don't have a DUC inventory for any other reason than to be efficient. We don't drill wells and hold them and wait on price or do any of that kind of stuff. So as we built this restart plan and we're looking towards the Northeast, we need a certain inventory of DUCs to be efficient. There was a -- the initial view was, ""Let's go to Northeast, let's do work there."" In West Virginia, we weren't going to do as many wells, and so we could burn off some of our DUC inventory because we didn't need as many to be as efficient. And that is -- that variable moves around all the time. And so it's an efficiency issue. It's a straight-up economic issue. But in this case, at this moment in time, with clearing up excess inventory, you'll recall we came to a very abrupt halt. And so as you work off that inventory and get it down to where it needs to be, that's why they came out the way they did. And we've got about 100 across the company and most of Fayettevilles will be done, and many more West Virginias will be done, and we'll have Fayettevilles -- or excuse me, Appalachias towards the end of the year. But we end up at 60-or-so by the end of the year. And keep in mind, from an operational perspective, we -- calendar years are only to do budgets. Operationally, we keep the machine flowing through the year. Part of our plan of this restart had 2017 in mind. And again, a continuous efficient -- hyper efficient operating regime."

One, the statement I made before, DUCs are an efficiency improvement tool for us more than a pile of a bunch of DUCs and wait for price to get better and then move them off. So we're -- this initial phase of restart related to DUCs is just putting the house from an abrupt start into an efficient mode again. If we're not drilling a bunch of wells in a particular area, we don't need a bunch of DUCs. And we can monetize those and get cash flow coming back quickly. As we go into '17, my guess from a drilling and completions kind of overall priority will be more what we -- what I would call normal. First of all, highly instructed by economics and differentials and cash flow. We'll invest within cash flow, as I said earlier. We'll prioritize where we go and how we do it based off of a reasonably smooth development plan, but one that is driven by economics. And we will shore up our confidence in that through a hedging program. And so you'll -- you won't see some kind of opening like we're starting over in '17 and doing a bunch of completions. You ought to see us trend through the rest of this year. So as we -- they'll ebb and flow, but not by plus and minus 30s because we'll have cleaned that up by now."

And thank you for joining us on our call today.
This year has been one of unwavering focus in SWN. And that focus is on our commitments that we laid out in February, namely to strengthen our balance sheet, aggressively improve margin, optimize the portfolio and remain agile, enabling us to be ready to capture opportunities to add value as the commodity price environment improves. And we're delighted to be here today to talk with you about this and talk about another quarter in which we delivered on those commitments.
I'd like to start by thanking the Southwestern team for all that has been accomplished so far this year. We've tackled a number of different challenges and set the company up for significant value creation as we finish up 2016 and prepare to move on to 2017. This year's accomplishments are a direct reflection of the commitment and dedication that each employee brings to the work every day, and I commend you for all that you do and all that you've done.
When we spoke last quarter, we discussed our plans to reinitiate investment in drilling and completion activities as a result of our strengthened balance sheet, the improving commodity price environment and our ability to assure solid returns provided by our commitment to prudent hedging and disciplined risk management. We'll provide more details about this in a few minutes. However, I can tell you that the learning, planning and preparation that each of the teams focused on during the pause in drilling and completions activity resulted in an extremely successful reinitiation of our drilling and completion operations.
As expected, we now have 5 rigs running company-wide: 2 in Northeast Appalachia, 2 in Southwest Appalachia and one in Fayetteville. The drilling results have been better than expected as we've seen record performance in drilling times that are even better than when we halted activity at the end of 2015.
However, speed is only part of the story. We've also been able to stay within our targeted zone over 95% of the time, which can be as narrow as 10 feet. Steering the well fully in zone supports the completion optimization by placing the entire length of the lateral in the integral that is most favorable for fracture stimulation and initiation. These impressive results have been driven by the learnings we captured from drilling and completing wells on paper during the first half of the year and applying these learnings now as we resume activity.
Additionally, the utilization of technology such as rotary steerable tools and other technologies are now standard on many of our wells. The activity in the second half of this year primes the portfolio for a robust 2017.
Regarding 2017, while we have not approved next year's capital program, at current strip prices, we expect cash flow to be in excess of $1 billion. We've had some questions on maintenance capital for next year. So let me reconfirm that the maintenance capital required to hold 2017 annual volumes flat at 2016 levels is only $700 million, given our improved capital efficiency and the benefits of flow -- flowing from our recent restart activity of approximately 150 Bcf equivalent of incremental 2017 production from the wells that we are drilling and completing during the second half of this year. With this quarter's impressive restart of activity, we also fully expect to arrest our production decline by the end of the year, this year, 2016, after which we will be back on the growth trajectory.
Reduced overall decline and resumption of value-added growth are both the results of our work to improve the performance of our vast portfolio. This $700 million in maintenance capital is an all-in capital number, including capitalized interest and expenses.
Closing this part of the discussion, while the maintenance capital is approximately $700 million, this is well below the expected more than $1 billion in cash flow for 2017 that I mentioned earlier at current strip prices. We plan to watch the impacts of the winter weather on 2017 prices and issue public guidance in February.
Let me now move on to our marketing and commercial activities. As is historically the case, we experienced our widest differentials for the year in the third quarter. Our overall discount, inclusive of differentials and transport costs, was $1.03 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing compared to $1 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing during the third quarter of 2015. This slight widening of the 2016 quarter was influenced largely by regional storage levels being at or near capacity and the percentage of total production from our Northeast assets increasing versus guidance.
Factoring in the forecasted gains of approximately $0.03 per Mcf on basis hedges currently in place, the company anticipates its total company discount to NYMEX for the year will be at the high end of guidance range or about $0.83 per Mcf.
We do believe that the current challenges facing the Appalachia Basin are a short-term issue and that the quality and quantity of our transportation portfolio in our Appalachian Basin businesses is robust and allows us both strong access to markets and growth opportunities this year and beyond. Over the long-term, our view of -- on improving regional basis differentials has not changed. And we expect the projected capacity additions out of the greater Appalachian region to come online over the next few years. These pipeline projects have robust economics and are of high quality, and we remain confident that the capacity for these pipeline projects gets overbuilt, albeit not without some scheduling challenges on individual projects.
Lastly, we are encouraged by the strengthening of NGL pricing for 2016 and how the NGL demand picture, particularly ethane, seems to be shaping up over the next few years. Given SWN's capacity on ATEX, we are in a strong position to capitalize on rising ethane prices at Mont Belvieu as projects making up the estimated 620,000 barrels a day of new demand begin to come online between now and 2019. With our vast resource position and the optionality provided by the wet gas window of Southwest Appalachia, increased NGL prices materially enhance the margins provided from that area.
With that, let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the third quarter. And then, we'll have Jack talk a bit more about some operations."

Good morning, everyone. I thought I would start this morning by summarizing the steps we have taken to strengthen the balance sheet this year, since many of them were in progress at the end of the second quarter.
In the third quarter, we completed the equity offering for $1.25 billion, of which a portion was used to retire $700 million in 2018 debt maturities, with $500 million earmarked for resumption of drilling and completion activities. Additionally, in the third quarter, we closed the previously announced acreage divestiture in Southwest Appalachia. As you saw in last night's release, net debt as of September 30 was $3.2 billion, down from $4.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.
And as a reminder, when we amended the bank agreement, its structure changed from our historical revolving credit facility. The new credit facility is supplemented by the fully drawn $1.2 billion secured term loan, which we expect to utilize for liquidity purposes and result in large cash balances going forward compared to our historical amounts.
We have made great strides strengthening the balance sheet this year and expect net debt-to-EBITDA for 2017 to be in the high 2s, assuming current price levels. With these actions and the improved commodity price environment, we are confident in our trajectory and, therefore, have no other asset sale plans imminent or of a material nature. In the normal course, we will continue to evaluate options and opportunities, but are confident with our portfolio and balance sheet where it stands today.
In the third quarter, we continued to add to our hedge position. We have now hedged 535 Bcfe -- Bcf, excuse me, of 2017 production, of which approximately half of these positions are collars providing upside exposure to improving prices. On these 2017 hedges, we have a weighted average strike price for the swaps and purchase puts of $3 per Mcf. We have also been actively adding financial and physical basis hedges to the portfolio where we currently have 75 Bcf protected in the fourth quarter and 196 Bcf protected in 2017. These hedging activities will help us achieve our expected returns, providing downside protection while also retaining upside potential as prices improve.
With the financial strengthening steps taken in 2016, we are now positioned to drive value generation with our premier assets.
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results in the third quarter."

As Bill mentioned earlier, we have successfully reinitiated our drilling and completion activities, which was a primary focus of the third quarter for operations. It's not often that you completely halt drilling and completion work for 6 months and then ramp up to 5 rigs in such a short period of time as we have this year. The success of this resumption demonstrates our differentiating agility as a company.
While returning to drilling and completions, we did not lose sight of the importance of our 2016 strategic initiatives, evidenced by once again hitting the top end of our production guidance at 211 Bcfe, while continuing our focus on improving margins. In particular, we reduced our lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis for the fifth quarter in a row.
In each of our areas, we continue to push the boundaries of our completion design. We are experimenting with increased proppant volumes with tests in Southwest Appalachia reaching up to 5,000 pounds per foot. We are also challenging ourselves to find the technical limits of these solutions. With such a vast number of drilling locations in the area, determining the optimal proppant loading will significantly increase the value of this play.
Our proppant testing is not just limited to Southwest Appalachia. We are also testing this in each of our other operating areas. In Fayetteville, we are testing over 2x as much proppant as our historical averages were. We expect to have some preliminary results on our next call, but the early indications are promising.
In Southwest Appalachia, we completed 8 wells in the third quarter and plan to connect 9 wells to sales by -- prior to the end of the year. While we did not turn on any wells to sales in the third quarter, we continue to see strong well performance from our Ridgetop Land Ventures Pad in Wetzel County, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, we have increased our lean gas type curves for the second time this year to approximately 25 Bcfe based on 7,500 foot laterals. The wells that we have drilled and completed there continue to outperform the offset wells drilled by the previous operator by as much as 40%. As we look forward, this asset provides substantial optionality where capital could be allocated to the wet or dry gas targets depending on commodity prices.
Moving to Northeast Appalachia, we currently have 2 rigs running which were the first 2 rigs to be mobilized. As Bill mentioned, the preparation for the reinitiation of activity resulted in some exceptional accomplishments. For the quarter, we have achieved a record total drill depth time of less than 8 days from reentry to reentry, which is 5% faster than the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in these results was one well drilled over 4,700 foot of lateral in just 24 hours, a company record in the area.
On the completion size -- side, we have tested reduced cluster spacing to increase well performance. This, when coupled with the optimized flow techniques we're using, expect to materially improve the flow rates. For example, the Racine pad we brought on in Susquehanna County this quarter came online at greater than 50 million cubic feet a day from just 3 wells. We plan to continue testing these techniques in the fourth quarter, and we'll discuss further as we have more information.
Moving to Fayetteville. We hit a very big milestone there during the third quarter where we surpassed 5 trillion cubic feet of production since our inception in 2004. Even with the recent reduction in rig count, this play still produces approximately 2% of the nation's gas supply and contributed over $60 million to the company in cash flow in the third quarter.
We continued our testing efforts in Fayetteville during the quarter on the Moorefield Shale, which lies just below the Fayetteville Shale. We brought online one Moorefield well at the end of June that had an initial production rate of 6.2 million cubic feet of gas per day, a lateral length of approximately 7,300 feet and an estimated EUR of over 4 Bcf.
This continues the encouraging results we've seen since the beginning of 2015. The 7 Moorefield wells brought online since the beginning of the year in '15 averaged an additional -- initial production rate of 7.2 million cubic feet a day, a lateral length of approximately 6,950 feet and an estimated EUR of over 5 Bcfe. We will continue watching the long-term performance of these wells to determine the aerial extent of the acreage prospective for this interval. With the potential of the Moorefield and the impact of increased proppant loading in the Fayetteville that we discussed earlier, we are encouraged that these, along with other initiatives being tested in the play, could significantly lower the breakeven price for the play and help it compete with opportunities available in the Appalachian portion of the portfolio.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we'll now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

First component on fracture stimulation side is we want to be as efficient as we can, and we want to get the count to where it optimally suits our budget. The second thing that we talked about, and this is critical, is the frac intensity or the testing that's going on these -- on some of these wells. We're ramping sand loading in a couple of cases from 1,000 to 2,000 pounds a foot, from 2,000 to 5,000 pounds a foot. And so -- that testing impacts some of these wells. And to put much more sand in that many more stages into a well takes longer to do. And so the only issue that we have right now -- and it's not really an issue. I miscalled it, It's an opportunity  -- is we're doing some testing related to higher sand loading, which will have positive effects we expect on our wells. We've already seen that in West Virginia where we've gone up about 2,000 to almost 3,000 pounds in wells already online. And that, with how we're landing and how we're flowing them and all of that, is improving their individual performance. we expect that to be the case elsewhere. and nuance to all of that statement is we're right now focused on technical limit. So we've already proved to ourselves that we can get a whole lot more sand in and then make whole lot better wells, which makes them more economic. We want to know how much more can you do. so we focus the focus on that. We will do those wells and get them online and see and we'll break them. And if we go to the place where much higher sand content and stage phasing, et cetera, becomes more of the norm after we tested, then we readjust our schedule, let you know what that looks like, and go from there.

And you move the needle. So there's a lot of very exciting testing going on around water management and around different techniques. It can move the dial. So as you work through the remainder of this year and continue this, the planning for '17, all of that will be taken into account. But the headline for you is really it's all about economic value and driving economic value that what we have. So the bias, the current view of this obviously goes to capturing that value in the northeast."

And assuming pipes come in when -- [indiscernible] come in, we can ramp that thing at 35% a year for the next 3 years comfortable. we wanted to look at where the pipe gets built. So committing our right pipes in the right place to access our acreage was really important. And we stepped back. 16 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity, excluding expansion capacity, being built all in one area is a lot of capacity. And taking on long-term commitments, which end up having to drill into or whatever, didn't make any sense to us at all. And so we said we're wait. Because we do believe and, I think the industry shares this with us, that there will come an inflection point in the -- all of this expansion were the cause of those. especially when you get into any expansion type capacity, the cost of that comes down. and we will get to that at a later date as costs come down. and the terms get more rationalized. We also have the opportunity to enter firm sales capacity where we are making sales into other consuming demand-side in capacity. So we'll continue to work that. And Randy may have some additional color put on that. the high level, it's kind of our philosophy."

And thank you for joining us on our call today.
This year has been one of unwavering focus in SWN. And that focus is on our commitments that we laid out in February, namely to strengthen our balance sheet, aggressively improve margin, optimize the portfolio and remain agile, enabling us to be ready to capture opportunities to add value as the commodity price environment improves. And we're delighted to be here today to talk with you about this and talk about another quarter in which we delivered on those commitments.
I'd like to start by thanking the Southwestern team for all that has been accomplished so far this year. We've tackled a number of different challenges and set the company up for significant value creation as we finish up 2016 and prepare to move on to 2017. This year's accomplishments are a direct reflection of the commitment and dedication that each employee brings to the work every day, and I commend you for all that you do and all that you've done.
When we spoke last quarter, we discussed our plans to reinitiate investment in drilling and completion activities as a result of our strengthened balance sheet, the improving commodity price environment and our ability to assure solid returns provided by our commitment to prudent hedging and disciplined risk management. We'll provide more details about this in a few minutes. However, I can tell you that the learning, planning and preparation that each of the teams focused on during the pause in drilling and completions activity resulted in an extremely successful reinitiation of our drilling and completion operations.
As expected, we now have 5 rigs running company-wide: 2 in Northeast Appalachia, 2 in Southwest Appalachia and one in Fayetteville. The drilling results have been better than expected as we've seen record performance in drilling times that are even better than when we halted activity at the end of 2015.
However, speed is only part of the story. We've also been able to stay within our targeted zone over 95% of the time, which can be as narrow as 10 feet. Steering the well fully in zone supports the completion optimization by placing the entire length of the lateral in the integral that is most favorable for fracture stimulation and initiation. These impressive results have been driven by the learnings we captured from drilling and completing wells on paper during the first half of the year and applying these learnings now as we resume activity.
Additionally, the utilization of technology such as rotary steerable tools and other technologies are now standard on many of our wells. The activity in the second half of this year primes the portfolio for a robust 2017.
Regarding 2017, while we have not approved next year's capital program, at current strip prices, we expect cash flow to be in excess of $1 billion. We've had some questions on maintenance capital for next year. So let me reconfirm that the maintenance capital required to hold 2017 annual volumes flat at 2016 levels is only $700 million, given our improved capital efficiency and the benefits of flow -- flowing from our recent restart activity of approximately 150 Bcf equivalent of incremental 2017 production from the wells that we are drilling and completing during the second half of this year. With this quarter's impressive restart of activity, we also fully expect to arrest our production decline by the end of the year, this year, 2016, after which we will be back on the growth trajectory.
Reduced overall decline and resumption of value-added growth are both the results of our work to improve the performance of our vast portfolio. This $700 million in maintenance capital is an all-in capital number, including capitalized interest and expenses.
Closing this part of the discussion, while the maintenance capital is approximately $700 million, this is well below the expected more than $1 billion in cash flow for 2017 that I mentioned earlier at current strip prices. We plan to watch the impacts of the winter weather on 2017 prices and issue public guidance in February.
Let me now move on to our marketing and commercial activities. As is historically the case, we experienced our widest differentials for the year in the third quarter. Our overall discount, inclusive of differentials and transport costs, was $1.03 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing compared to $1 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing during the third quarter of 2015. This slight widening of the 2016 quarter was influenced largely by regional storage levels being at or near capacity and the percentage of total production from our Northeast assets increasing versus guidance.
Factoring in the forecasted gains of approximately $0.03 per Mcf on basis hedges currently in place, the company anticipates its total company discount to NYMEX for the year will be at the high end of guidance range or about $0.83 per Mcf.
We do believe that the current challenges facing the Appalachia Basin are a short-term issue and that the quality and quantity of our transportation portfolio in our Appalachian Basin businesses is robust and allows us both strong access to markets and growth opportunities this year and beyond. Over the long-term, our view of -- on improving regional basis differentials has not changed. And we expect the projected capacity additions out of the greater Appalachian region to come online over the next few years. These pipeline projects have robust economics and are of high quality, and we remain confident that the capacity for these pipeline projects gets overbuilt, albeit not without some scheduling challenges on individual projects.
Lastly, we are encouraged by the strengthening of NGL pricing for 2016 and how the NGL demand picture, particularly ethane, seems to be shaping up over the next few years. Given SWN's capacity on ATEX, we are in a strong position to capitalize on rising ethane prices at Mont Belvieu as projects making up the estimated 620,000 barrels a day of new demand begin to come online between now and 2019. With our vast resource position and the optionality provided by the wet gas window of Southwest Appalachia, increased NGL prices materially enhance the margins provided from that area.
With that, let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the third quarter. And then, we'll have Jack talk a bit more about some operations."

Good morning, everyone. I thought I would start this morning by summarizing the steps we have taken to strengthen the balance sheet this year, since many of them were in progress at the end of the second quarter.
In the third quarter, we completed the equity offering for $1.25 billion, of which a portion was used to retire $700 million in 2018 debt maturities, with $500 million earmarked for resumption of drilling and completion activities. Additionally, in the third quarter, we closed the previously announced acreage divestiture in Southwest Appalachia. As you saw in last night's release, net debt as of September 30 was $3.2 billion, down from $4.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.
And as a reminder, when we amended the bank agreement, its structure changed from our historical revolving credit facility. The new credit facility is supplemented by the fully drawn $1.2 billion secured term loan, which we expect to utilize for liquidity purposes and result in large cash balances going forward compared to our historical amounts.
We have made great strides strengthening the balance sheet this year and expect net debt-to-EBITDA for 2017 to be in the high 2s, assuming current price levels. With these actions and the improved commodity price environment, we are confident in our trajectory and, therefore, have no other asset sale plans imminent or of a material nature. In the normal course, we will continue to evaluate options and opportunities, but are confident with our portfolio and balance sheet where it stands today.
In the third quarter, we continued to add to our hedge position. We have now hedged 535 Bcfe -- Bcf, excuse me, of 2017 production, of which approximately half of these positions are collars providing upside exposure to improving prices. On these 2017 hedges, we have a weighted average strike price for the swaps and purchase puts of $3 per Mcf. We have also been actively adding financial and physical basis hedges to the portfolio where we currently have 75 Bcf protected in the fourth quarter and 196 Bcf protected in 2017. These hedging activities will help us achieve our expected returns, providing downside protection while also retaining upside potential as prices improve.
With the financial strengthening steps taken in 2016, we are now positioned to drive value generation with our premier assets.
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results in the third quarter."

As Bill mentioned earlier, we have successfully reinitiated our drilling and completion activities, which was a primary focus of the third quarter for operations. It's not often that you completely halt drilling and completion work for 6 months and then ramp up to 5 rigs in such a short period of time as we have this year. The success of this resumption demonstrates our differentiating agility as a company.
While returning to drilling and completions, we did not lose sight of the importance of our 2016 strategic initiatives, evidenced by once again hitting the top end of our production guidance at 211 Bcfe, while continuing our focus on improving margins. In particular, we reduced our lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis for the fifth quarter in a row.
In each of our areas, we continue to push the boundaries of our completion design. We are experimenting with increased proppant volumes with tests in Southwest Appalachia reaching up to 5,000 pounds per foot. We are also challenging ourselves to find the technical limits of these solutions. With such a vast number of drilling locations in the area, determining the optimal proppant loading will significantly increase the value of this play.
Our proppant testing is not just limited to Southwest Appalachia. We are also testing this in each of our other operating areas. In Fayetteville, we are testing over 2x as much proppant as our historical averages were. We expect to have some preliminary results on our next call, but the early indications are promising.
In Southwest Appalachia, we completed 8 wells in the third quarter and plan to connect 9 wells to sales by -- prior to the end of the year. While we did not turn on any wells to sales in the third quarter, we continue to see strong well performance from our Ridgetop Land Ventures Pad in Wetzel County, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, we have increased our lean gas type curves for the second time this year to approximately 25 Bcfe based on 7,500 foot laterals. The wells that we have drilled and completed there continue to outperform the offset wells drilled by the previous operator by as much as 40%. As we look forward, this asset provides substantial optionality where capital could be allocated to the wet or dry gas targets depending on commodity prices.
Moving to Northeast Appalachia, we currently have 2 rigs running which were the first 2 rigs to be mobilized. As Bill mentioned, the preparation for the reinitiation of activity resulted in some exceptional accomplishments. For the quarter, we have achieved a record total drill depth time of less than 8 days from reentry to reentry, which is 5% faster than the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in these results was one well drilled over 4,700 foot of lateral in just 24 hours, a company record in the area.
On the completion size -- side, we have tested reduced cluster spacing to increase well performance. This, when coupled with the optimized flow techniques we're using, expect to materially improve the flow rates. For example, the Racine pad we brought on in Susquehanna County this quarter came online at greater than 50 million cubic feet a day from just 3 wells. We plan to continue testing these techniques in the fourth quarter, and we'll discuss further as we have more information.
Moving to Fayetteville. We hit a very big milestone there during the third quarter where we surpassed 5 trillion cubic feet of production since our inception in 2004. Even with the recent reduction in rig count, this play still produces approximately 2% of the nation's gas supply and contributed over $60 million to the company in cash flow in the third quarter.
We continued our testing efforts in Fayetteville during the quarter on the Moorefield Shale, which lies just below the Fayetteville Shale. We brought online one Moorefield well at the end of June that had an initial production rate of 6.2 million cubic feet of gas per day, a lateral length of approximately 7,300 feet and an estimated EUR of over 4 Bcf.
This continues the encouraging results we've seen since the beginning of 2015. The 7 Moorefield wells brought online since the beginning of the year in '15 averaged an additional -- initial production rate of 7.2 million cubic feet a day, a lateral length of approximately 6,950 feet and an estimated EUR of over 5 Bcfe. We will continue watching the long-term performance of these wells to determine the aerial extent of the acreage prospective for this interval. With the potential of the Moorefield and the impact of increased proppant loading in the Fayetteville that we discussed earlier, we are encouraged that these, along with other initiatives being tested in the play, could significantly lower the breakeven price for the play and help it compete with opportunities available in the Appalachian portion of the portfolio.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we'll now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

And our objective is to invest it in cash flow. And as that cash flow changes or rises, I guess, the option is to move forward. The rigs are -- our rigs were very flexible in terms of what we can turn on and turn off. And so we can be very agile in that view as we get closer to February."

The headline is it's going terrific. Remember, there's 2 components to this. First component on the fracture stimulation side is we want to be as efficient as we can and we want to get the count to where it optimally suits our budget.
The second thing that we talked about, and this is critical, is the frac intensity or the testing that's going on these -- on some of these wells. We're ramping sand loading in a couple of cases from 1,000 to 2,000 pounds a foot from 2,000 to 5,000 pounds a foot. And so those -- that testing impacts some of these wells. And to put that much more sand in that many more stages into a well takes longer to do. And so the only issue that we have right now -- and it's not really an issue. I miscalled it, it's an opportunity -- is we're doing some testing related to higher sand loading, which will have positive effects, we expect, on our wells. We've already seen that in West Virginia where we've gone up about 2,000 to almost 3,000 pounds in wells that are already online. And that, combined with how we're landing them and how we're flowing them and all of that, is improving their individual performance. Well, we expect that to be the case elsewhere.
And a nuance to all of that statement is we're, right now, focused on technical limit. So we've already proved out to ourselves that we can get a whole lot more sand in and then make a whole lot better wells, which makes them more economic. We want to know how much more can you do. And so we focused the folks on that. We'll do those wells and get them online and see, and then we'll bring them. And if we go to the place where much higher sand content and stage phasing, et cetera, becomes more of the norm after we test it, then we'll readjust our schedule and let you know what that looks like and go from there.

We have brought on, in Northeast PA, some of our -- the Racine pad I mentioned was one that we went to tighter cluster spacing, more stages.

Last year, we added some additional capacity around what we already had, anticipating that you could have some scheduling challenges.
I think, further, probably the greatest near-term impact becomes the seasonal differential challenge, especially as production and pricing resumes. And if you get production come back online, you get the differential challenge. We're trying to manage that through basis hedging.

They're up to $8 million on the well cost, $8 million to $8.5 million, but we're getting a great return. I believe the work we did at the end of '15, we think, on that $2 million we invested extra on those, we got 2 PVI on that $2 million.

We want to understand how the changes to our completion technology or completion practices, flow back practices and drilling practices, what impact that has on the Fayetteville.
I remain in the same place that I spoke about earlier though is that you have some targeted testing, and if that opens up new frontiers then we put that into the mix. You have some land capture in the 2 other divisions, not Fayetteville. Absent of those and maybe one or 2 other things, then you start looking at relative economics to the Northeast. A big piece of our capital productivity improvement, a big piece of really our overall performance improvement is allocating capital to the highest best use of that capital. And today, with current technology and current commercial terms and all the other things that go into that, our 2 Northeast assets, by and large, are -- have that advantage. And so in the first pileup of projects, the majority of it obviously goes to the Northeast. But as see you're seeing right now, we have a rig in Fayetteville. It's focusing on Moorefield. It's focusing on some other testing. And we've got some other things we're working on. And then, the rest of the activity is in the other 2 places. And we challenge the teams all the time, and they take this challenge on very well. And as you can see from our results, it shows through. Each group, while they're working for the whole of the company, they are driving in their own backyard, driving margin improvements, driving productivity and well improvements, major inroads into the water management of any of these divisions and you move the needle. So there's a lot of very exciting testing going on around water management and around different techniques. It can move the dial.
So as we work through the remainder of this year and continue this -- the planning for '17, all of that would be taken into account. But the headline for you is really it's all about economic value and driving economic value out of what we have. And so the bias, the current view at this 10 seconds obviously goes to the capturing that value in the Northeast."

We then wanted to look at where the pipes get built, so committing to the right pipes at the right place to access our acreage was really important. And then, we stepped back. 16 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity, excluding expansion capacity, being built all in one area is a lot of capacity. And taking on long-term commitments, which end up having to drill into or whatever, didn't make any sense to us at all. And so we said we're wait. Because we do believe and, I think the industry shares this with us, that there will come an inflection point in the -- all of this expansion were the cause of those. especially when you get into any expansion type capacity, the cost of that comes down. and we will get to that at a later date as costs come down. and the terms get more rationalized.

And thank you for joining us on our call today.
This year has been one of unwavering focus in SWN. And that focus is on our commitments that we laid out in February, namely to strengthen our balance sheet, aggressively improve margin, optimize the portfolio and remain agile, enabling us to be ready to capture opportunities to add value as the commodity price environment improves. And we're delighted to be here today to talk with you about this and to talk about another quarter in which we delivered on those commitments.
I'd like to start by thanking the Southwestern team for all that has been accomplished so far this year. We've tackled a number of different challenges and set the company up for significant value creation as we finish up 2016 and prepare to move on to 2017. This year's accomplishments are a direct reflection of the commitment and dedication that each employee brings to the work every day, and I commend you for all that you do and all that you've done.
When we spoke last quarter, we discussed our plans to reinitiate investment in drilling and completion activities as a result of our strengthened balance sheet, the improving commodity price environment and our ability to assure solid returns provided by our commitment to prudent hedging and disciplined risk management. We'll provide more details about this in a few minutes, however, I can tell you that the learning, planning and preparation that each of the teams focused on during the pause in drilling and completions activity resulted in an extremely successful reinitiation of our drilling and completion operations.
As expected, we now have 5 rigs running company-wide: 2 in Northeast Appalachia, 2 in Southwest Appalachia and 1 in Fayetteville. The drilling results have been better than expected as we've seen record performance in drilling times that are even better than when we halted activity at the end of 2015.
However, speed is only part of the story. We've also been able to stay within our targeted zone over 95% of the time, which can be as narrow as 10 feet. Steering the well fully in zone supports the completion optimization by placing the entire length of the lateral in the integral that is most favorable for fracture stimulation and initiation. These impressive results have been driven by the learnings we captured from drilling and completing wells on paper during the first half of the year and applying these learnings now as we resume activity.
Additionally, the utilization of technology such as rotary steerable tools and other technologies are now standard on many of our wells. The activity in the second half of this year primes the portfolio for a robust 2017.
Regarding 2017, while we have not approved next year's capital program, at current strip prices, we expect cash flow to be in excess of $1 billion. We've had some questions on maintenance capital for next year. So let me reconfirm that the maintenance capital required to hold 2017 annual volumes flat at 2016 levels is only $700 million, given our improved capital efficiency and the benefits of flow -- flowing from our recent restart activity of approximately 150 Bcf equivalent of incremental 2017 production from the wells that we are drilling and completing during the second half of this year. With this quarter's impressive restart of activity, we also fully expect to arrest our production decline by the end of the year, this year, 2016, after which we will be back on the growth trajectory.
Reduced overall decline and resumption of value-added growth are both the results of our work to improve the performance of our vast portfolio. This $700 million in maintenance capital is an all-in capital number, including capitalized interest and expenses.
Closing this part of the discussion. While the maintenance capital is approximately $700 million, this is well below the expected more than $1 billion in cash flow for 2017 that I mentioned earlier at current strip prices. We plan to watch the impacts of the winter weather on 2017 prices and issue public guidance in February.
Let me now move on to our marketing and commercial activities. As is historically the case, we experienced our widest differentials for the year in the third quarter. Our overall discount, inclusive of differentials and transport costs, was $1.03 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing compared to $1 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing during the third quarter of 2015. This slight widening of the 2016 quarter was influenced largely by regional storage levels being at or near capacity and the percentage of total production from our Northeast assets increasing versus guidance.
Factoring in the forecasted gains of approximately $0.03 per Mcf on basis hedges currently in place, the company anticipates its total company discount to NYMEX for the year will be at the high end of guidance range or about $0.83 per Mcf.
We do believe that the current challenges facing the Appalachian Basin are a short-term issue and that the quality and quantity of our transportation portfolio in our Appalachian Basin businesses is robust and allows us both strong access to markets and growth opportunities this year and beyond. Over the long term, our view of -- on improving regional basis differentials has not changed. And we expect the projected capacity additions out of the greater Appalachian region to come online over the next few years. These pipeline projects have robust economics and are of high quality, and we remain confident that the capacity for these pipeline projects gets overbuilt, albeit not without some scheduling challenges on individual projects.
Lastly, we are encouraged by the strengthening of NGL pricing for 2016 and how the NGL demand picture, particularly ethane, seems to be shaping up over the next few years. Given SWN's capacity on ATEX, we are in a strong position to capitalize on rising ethane prices at Mont Belvieu as projects making up the estimated 620,000 barrels a day of new demand begin to come online between now and 2019. With our vast resource position and the optionality provided by the wet gas window of Southwest Appalachia, increased NGL prices materially enhanced the margins provided from that area.
With that, let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the third quarter. And then, we'll have Jack talk a bit more about some operations."

In the third quarter, we completed the equity offering for $1.25 billion, of which a portion was used to retire $700 million in 2018 debt maturities with $500 million earmarked for resumption of drilling and completion activities. Additionally in the third quarter, we closed the previously announced acreage divestiture in Southwest Appalachia. As you saw in last night's release, net debt as of September 30 was $3.2 billion, down from $4.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.
And as a reminder, when we amended the bank agreement, its structure changed from our historical revolving credit facility. The new credit facility is supplemented by the fully drawn $1.2 billion secured term loan, which we expect to utilize for liquidity purposes and results in large cash balances going forward compared to our historical amounts.
We have made great strides strengthening the balance sheet this year and expect net debt to EBITDA for 2017 to be in the high 2s, assuming current price levels. With these actions and the improved commodity price environment, we are confident in our trajectory and, therefore, have no other asset sale plans imminent or of a material nature. In the normal course, we will continue to evaluate options and opportunities but are confident with our portfolio and balance sheet where it stands today.
In third quarter, we continued to add to our hedge position. We've now hedged 535 Bcfe -- Bcf, excuse me, of 2017 production, of which approximately half of these positions are collars providing upside exposure to improving prices. On these 2017 hedges, we have a weighted average strike price for the swaps and purchase puts of $3 per Mcf. We have also been actively adding financial and physical basis hedges to the portfolio where we currently have 75 Bcf protected in the fourth quarter and 196 Bcf protected in 2017. These hedging activities will help us achieve our expected returns, providing downside protection while also retaining upside potential as prices improve.
With the financial strengthening steps taken in 2016, we are now positioned to drive value generation with our premier assets.
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results in the third quarter."

As Bill mentioned earlier, we've successfully reinitiated our drilling and completion activities, which was a primary focus of the third quarter for operations. It's not often that you completely halt drilling and completion work for 6 months and then ramp up to 5 rigs in such a short period of time as we have this year. The success of this resumption demonstrates our differentiating agility as a company.
While returning to drilling and completions, we did not lose sight of the importance of our 2016 strategic initiatives evidenced by once again hitting the top end of our production guidance at 211 Bcfe while continuing our focus on improving margins. In particular, we reduced our lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis for the fifth quarter in a row.
In each of our areas, we continue to push the boundaries of our completion design. We are experimenting with increased proppant volumes with tests in Southwest Appalachia reaching up to 5,000 pounds per foot. We are also challenging ourselves to find the technical limits of these solutions. With such a vast number of drilling locations in the area, determining the optimal proppant loading will significantly increase the value of this play.
Our proppant testing is not just limited to Southwest Appalachia. We are also testing this in each of our other operating areas. In Fayetteville, we are testing over 2x as much proppant as our historical averages were. We expect to have some preliminary results on our next call, but the early indications are promising.
In Southwest Appalachia, we completed 8 wells in the third quarter and plan to connect 9 wells to sales by -- prior to the end of the year. While we did not turn on any wells to sales in the third quarter, we continue to see strong well performance from our Ridgetop Land Ventures Pad in Wetzel County, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, we've increased our lean gas type curves for the second time this year to approximately 25 Bcfe based on 7,500 foot laterals. The wells that we have drilled and completed there continue to outperform the offset wells drilled by the previous operator by as much as 40%. As we look forward, this asset provides substantial optionality where capital could be allocated to the wet or dry gas targets depending on commodity prices.
Moving to Northeast Appalachia, we currently have 2 rigs running, which were the first 2 rigs to be mobilized. As Bill mentioned, the preparation for the reinitiation of activity resulted in some exceptional accomplishments. For the quarter, we have achieved a record total drill depth time of less than 8 days from reentry to reentry, which is 5% faster than the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in these results was 1 well drilled over 4,700 foot of lateral in just 24 hours, a company record in the area.
On the completion size -- side, we have tested reduced cluster spacing to increase well performance. This, when coupled with the optimized flow techniques we're using, expect to materially improve the flow rates. For example, the Racine pad we brought on in Susquehanna County this quarter came online at greater than 50 million cubic feet a day from just 3 wells. We plan to continue testing these techniques in the fourth quarter, and we'll discuss further as we get more information.
Moving to Fayetteville. We hit a very big milestone there during the third quarter where we surpassed 5 trillion cubic feet of production since our inception in 2004. Even with the recent reduction in rig count, this play still produces approximately 2% of the nation's gas supply and contributed over $60 million to the company in cash flow in the third quarter.
We continue our testing efforts in Fayetteville during the quarter on the Moorefield Shale, which lies just below the Fayetteville Shale. We brought online one Moorefield well at the end of June that had an initial production rate of 6.2 million cubic feet of gas per day, a lateral length of approximately 7,300 feet and an estimated EUR of over 4 Bcf.
This continues the encouraging results we've seen since the beginning of 2015. The 7 Moorefield wells brought online since the beginning of the year in '15 averaged an additional -- initial production rate of 7.2 million cubic feet a day, a lateral length of approximately 6,950 feet and an estimated EUR of over 5 Bcfe. We will continue watching the long-term performance of these wells and determine the aerial extent of the acreage prospective for this interval. With the potential of the Moorefield and the impact of increased proppant loading in the Fayetteville that we discussed earlier, we are encouraged that these, along with other initiatives being tested in the play, could significantly lower the breakeven price for the play and help it compete with opportunities available in the Appalachia portion of the portfolio.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we'll now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

The second thing that we talked about -- and this is critical, is the frac intensity or the testing that's going on, on these -- on some of these wells. We're ramping sand loading in a couple cases from 1,000 to 2,000 pounds a foot from 2,000 to 5,000 pounds a foot. And so those -- that testing impacts some of these wells. And to put that much more sand in that many more stages into a well takes longer to do. And so the only issue that we have right now -- and it's not really an issue. I miscalled it. It's an opportunity -- is we're doing some testing related to higher sand loading, which will have positive effects, we expect, on our wells. We've already seen that in West Virginia where we've gone up above 2,000 to almost 3,000 pounds in wells that are already online.

So we've already proved up to ourselves that we can get a whole lot more sand in and make a whole lot better wells, which makes them more economic. We want to know how much can you do. And so we focused the folks on that. We'll do those wells and get them online and see and then we'll bring them. And if we go to the place where much higher sand content and stage phasing, et cetera, becomes more of the norm after we test it, then we'll readjust our schedule, let you know what that looks like and go from there. That's the real big piece of that whole calendar issue."

I've got engineers that would like to do a whole lot more than even the numbers we've been talking about, but we want to be prudent about it as well.

We are very, very aware and trying to be more aware every day of the different twists and turns that are going on with those projects. We think that both are robust projects and should happen. But we've known for some time that we needed to manage our overall portfolio in that area by adding additional capacity. Last year, we added some additional capacity around what we already had, anticipating that you could have some scheduling challenges. I think, further, probably the greatest near-term impact becomes the seasonal differential challenge, especially as production and pricing resumes. And if you get production coming back online, you get the differential challenge. We're trying to manage that through basis hedging. Our overall transportation portfolio pricing is very low in that area. And so managing that to the markets we serve, managing the -- any kind of a basis challenge with further hedging we certainly are doing, and we'll watch it closely.

Certainly, as we look at the Moorefield testing that's going on, we want to understand the aerial extent of that. We want to understand how the changes to our completion technology -- our completion practices, flowback practices and drilling practices, what impact that has on the Fayetteville. I remain in the same place that I spoke about earlier, though, is that you have some targeted testing, and if that opens up new frontiers, then we put that into the mix. You have some land capture in the 2 other divisions, not Fayetteville. Absent those and maybe 1 or 2 other things, then you start looking at relative economics to the Northeast. And a big piece of our capital productivity improvement, a big piece of, really, our overall performance improvement is allocating capital to the highest best use of that capital. And today, with current technology and current commercial terms and all the other things that go into that, our 2 Northeast assets, by and large, are -- have that advantage. And so in the first pileup of projects, the majority of it obviously goes to the Northeast. But as you're seeing right now, we have a rig in Fayetteville. It's focusing on Moorefield. It's focusing on some other testing. And we've got some other things we're working on. And then, the rest of the activity is in the other 2 places. And we challenge the teams all the time, and they take this challenge on very well. And as you can see from our results, it shows through. Each group, while they're working for the whole of the company, they're driving in their own backyard, driving margin improvements, driving productivity and well improvements. You make major inroads into the water management of any of these divisions and you move the needle. So there's a lot of very exciting testing going on around water management and around different techniques. It can move the dial. So as we work through the remainder of this year and continue this -- the planning for '17, all of that will be taken into account. But the headline for you is really it's all about economic value and driving economic value out of what we have. And so the bias, the current view at this 10 seconds obviously goes to capturing that value in the Northeast."

So those 2 factors combined really do start impacting kind of the wet versus dry economics when we start seeing some significant shift in ethane. And the longer-term outlook, given the crackers that are under construction as we speak, for demand in the Mont Belvieu area is fairly significant. We're looking at over 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of demand on top of a base that is 1.2 million. You couple that with some export capacity, and that's why you see a rather strong outlook for ethane, which we have some -- certainly have some good exposure to."

We then wanted to look at where the pipes get built, so committing to the right pipes at the right place to access our acreage was really important. And then, we stepped back. 16 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity, excluding expansion capacity being built all in one area is a lot of capacity. And taking on long-term commitments, which end up having to drill into or whatever, didn't make any sense to us at all. And so we said we'll wait because we do believe and, I think the industry shares this with us, that there will come an inflection point in the -- all this expansion where the cost of those and especially if you get into any expansion-type capacity, the cost of that comes down. and we will leg into that at a later date as that cost does come down and the terms get more rationalized.

And so every individual in this company is driven by, incentivized by the quest to reduce cost, improve the operating results of every part of the business. So you have it on the revenue side. You have it on the cost side. And we're committed to continue to increase that margin. And finally, we will maintain the rigor, capital allocation, capital discipline, financial responsibility that we've demonstrated so far this year and is a hallmark of our company. 
So I want to thank each of you for joining us on the call today. Thanks for all the questions. We look forward to seeing you along the road and hope you all have a great weekend."

And thank you for joining us on our call today.
This year has been one of unwavering focus in SWN. And that focus is on our commitments that we laid out in February, namely to strengthen our balance sheet, aggressively improve margin, optimize the portfolio and remain agile, enabling us to be ready to capture opportunities to add value as the commodity price environment improves. And we're delighted to be here today to talk with you about this and to talk about another quarter in which we delivered on those commitments.
I'd like to start by thanking the Southwestern team for all that has been accomplished so far this year. We've tackled a number of different challenges and set the company up for significant value creation as we finish up 2016 and prepare to move on to 2017. This year's accomplishments are a direct reflection of the commitment and dedication that each employee brings to the work every day, and I commend you for all that you do and all that you've done.
When we spoke last quarter, we discussed our plans to reinitiate investment in drilling and completion activities as a result of our strengthened balance sheet, the improving commodity price environment and our ability to assure solid returns provided by our commitment to prudent hedging and disciplined risk management. We'll provide more details about this in a few minutes, however, I can tell you that the learning, planning and preparation that each of the teams focused on during the pause in drilling and completions activity resulted in an extremely successful reinitiation of our drilling and completion operations.
As expected, we now have 5 rigs running company-wide: 2 in Northeast Appalachia, 2 in Southwest Appalachia and 1 in Fayetteville. The drilling results have been better than expected as we've seen record performance in drilling times that are even better than when we halted activity at the end of 2015.
However, speed is only part of the story. We've also been able to stay within our targeted zone over 95% of the time, which can be as narrow as 10 feet. Steering the well fully in zone supports the completion optimization by placing the entire length of the lateral in the integral that is most favorable for fracture stimulation and initiation. These impressive results have been driven by the learnings we captured from drilling and completing wells on paper during the first half of the year and applying these learnings now as we resume activity.
Additionally, the utilization of technology such as rotary steerable tools and other technologies are now standard on many of our wells. The activity in the second half of this year primes the portfolio for a robust 2017.
Regarding 2017, while we have not approved next year's capital program, at current strip prices, we expect cash flow to be in excess of $1 billion. We've had some questions on maintenance capital for next year. So let me reconfirm that the maintenance capital required to hold 2017 annual volumes flat at 2016 levels is only $700 million, given our improved capital efficiency and the benefits of flow -- flowing from our recent restart activity of approximately 150 Bcf equivalent of incremental 2017 production from the wells that we are drilling and completing during the second half of this year. With this quarter's impressive restart of activity, we also fully expect to arrest our production decline by the end of the year, this year, 2016, after which we will be back on the growth trajectory.
Reduced overall decline and resumption of value-added growth are both the results of our work to improve the performance of our vast portfolio. This $700 million in maintenance capital is an all-in capital number, including capitalized interest and expenses.
Closing this part of the discussion. While the maintenance capital is approximately $700 million, this is well below the expected more than $1 billion in cash flow for 2017 that I mentioned earlier at current strip prices. We plan to watch the impacts of the winter weather on 2017 prices and issue public guidance in February.
Let me now move on to our marketing and commercial activities. As is historically the case, we experienced our widest differentials for the year in the third quarter. Our overall discount, inclusive of differentials and transport costs, was $1.03 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing compared to $1 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement pricing during the third quarter of 2015. This slight widening of the 2016 quarter was influenced largely by regional storage levels being at or near capacity and the percentage of total production from our Northeast assets increasing versus guidance.
Factoring in the forecasted gains of approximately $0.03 per Mcf on basis hedges currently in place, the company anticipates its total company discount to NYMEX for the year will be at the high end of guidance range or about $0.83 per Mcf.
We do believe that the current challenges facing the Appalachian Basin are a short-term issue and that the quality and quantity of our transportation portfolio in our Appalachian Basin businesses is robust and allows us both strong access to markets and growth opportunities this year and beyond. Over the long term, our view of -- on improving regional basis differentials has not changed. And we expect the projected capacity additions out of the greater Appalachian region to come online over the next few years. These pipeline projects have robust economics and are of high quality, and we remain confident that the capacity for these pipeline projects gets overbuilt, albeit not without some scheduling challenges on individual projects.
Lastly, we are encouraged by the strengthening of NGL pricing for 2016 and how the NGL demand picture, particularly ethane, seems to be shaping up over the next few years. Given SWN's capacity on ATEX, we are in a strong position to capitalize on rising ethane prices at Mont Belvieu as projects making up the estimated 620,000 barrels a day of new demand begin to come online between now and 2019. With our vast resource position and the optionality provided by the wet gas window of Southwest Appalachia, increased NGL prices materially enhanced the margins provided from that area.
With that, let me turn over to Craig to discuss some of our financial highlights from the third quarter. And then, we'll have Jack talk a bit more about some operations."

Good morning, everyone. I thought I would start this morning by summarizing the steps we have taken to strengthen the balance sheet this year, since many of them were in progress at the end of the second quarter.
In the third quarter, we completed the equity offering for $1.25 billion, of which a portion was used to retire $700 million in 2018 debt maturities with $500 million earmarked for resumption of drilling and completion activities. Additionally in the third quarter, we closed the previously announced acreage divestiture in Southwest Appalachia. As you saw in last night's release, net debt as of September 30 was $3.2 billion, down from $4.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.
And as a reminder, when we amended the bank agreement, its structure changed from our historical revolving credit facility. The new credit facility is supplemented by the fully drawn $1.2 billion secured term loan, which we expect to utilize for liquidity purposes and results in large cash balances going forward compared to our historical amounts.
We have made great strides strengthening the balance sheet this year and expect net debt to EBITDA for 2017 to be in the high 2s, assuming current price levels. With these actions and the improved commodity price environment, we are confident in our trajectory and, therefore, have no other asset sale plans imminent or of a material nature. In the normal course, we will continue to evaluate options and opportunities but are confident with our portfolio and balance sheet where it stands today.
In third quarter, we continued to add to our hedge position. We've now hedged 535 Bcfe -- Bcf, excuse me, of 2017 production, of which approximately half of these positions are collars providing upside exposure to improving prices. On these 2017 hedges, we have a weighted average strike price for the swaps and purchase puts of $3 per Mcf. We have also been actively adding financial and physical basis hedges to the portfolio where we currently have 75 Bcf protected in the fourth quarter and 196 Bcf protected in 2017. These hedging activities will help us achieve our expected returns, providing downside protection while also retaining upside potential as prices improve.
With the financial strengthening steps taken in 2016, we are now positioned to drive value generation with our premier assets.
I will now turn it over to Jack to discuss some of the details of our operational results in the third quarter."

As Bill mentioned earlier, we've successfully reinitiated our drilling and completion activities, which was a primary focus of the third quarter for operations. It's not often that you completely halt drilling and completion work for 6 months and then ramp up to 5 rigs in such a short period of time as we have this year. The success of this resumption demonstrates our differentiating agility as a company.
While returning to drilling and completions, we did not lose sight of the importance of our 2016 strategic initiatives evidenced by once again hitting the top end of our production guidance at 211 Bcfe while continuing our focus on improving margins. In particular, we reduced our lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis for the fifth quarter in a row.
In each of our areas, we continue to push the boundaries of our completion design. We are experimenting with increased proppant volumes with tests in Southwest Appalachia reaching up to 5,000 pounds per foot. We are also challenging ourselves to find the technical limits of these solutions. With such a vast number of drilling locations in the area, determining the optimal proppant loading will significantly increase the value of this play.
Our proppant testing is not just limited to Southwest Appalachia. We are also testing this in each of our other operating areas. In Fayetteville, we are testing over 2x as much proppant as our historical averages were. We expect to have some preliminary results on our next call, but the early indications are promising.
In Southwest Appalachia, we completed 8 wells in the third quarter and plan to connect 9 wells to sales by -- prior to the end of the year. While we did not turn on any wells to sales in the third quarter, we continue to see strong well performance from our Ridgetop Land Ventures Pad in Wetzel County, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, we've increased our lean gas type curves for the second time this year to approximately 25 Bcfe based on 7,500 foot laterals. The wells that we have drilled and completed there continue to outperform the offset wells drilled by the previous operator by as much as 40%. As we look forward, this asset provides substantial optionality where capital could be allocated to the wet or dry gas targets depending on commodity prices.
Moving to Northeast Appalachia, we currently have 2 rigs running, which were the first 2 rigs to be mobilized. As Bill mentioned, the preparation for the reinitiation of activity resulted in some exceptional accomplishments. For the quarter, we have achieved a record total drill depth time of less than 8 days from reentry to reentry, which is 5% faster than the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in these results was 1 well drilled over 4,700 foot of lateral in just 24 hours, a company record in the area.
On the completion size -- side, we have tested reduced cluster spacing to increase well performance. This, when coupled with the optimized flow techniques we're using, expect to materially improve the flow rates. For example, the Racine pad we brought on in Susquehanna County this quarter came online at greater than 50 million cubic feet a day from just 3 wells. We plan to continue testing these techniques in the fourth quarter, and we'll discuss further as we get more information.
Moving to Fayetteville. We hit a very big milestone there during the third quarter where we surpassed 5 trillion cubic feet of production since our inception in 2004. Even with the recent reduction in rig count, this play still produces approximately 2% of the nation's gas supply and contributed over $60 million to the company in cash flow in the third quarter.
We continue our testing efforts in Fayetteville during the quarter on the Moorefield Shale, which lies just below the Fayetteville Shale. We brought online one Moorefield well at the end of June that had an initial production rate of 6.2 million cubic feet of gas per day, a lateral length of approximately 7,300 feet and an estimated EUR of over 4 Bcf.
This continues the encouraging results we've seen since the beginning of 2015. The 7 Moorefield wells brought online since the beginning of the year in '15 averaged an additional -- initial production rate of 7.2 million cubic feet a day, a lateral length of approximately 6,950 feet and an estimated EUR of over 5 Bcfe. We will continue watching the long-term performance of these wells and determine the aerial extent of the acreage prospective for this interval. With the potential of the Moorefield and the impact of increased proppant loading in the Fayetteville that we discussed earlier, we are encouraged that these, along with other initiatives being tested in the play, could significantly lower the breakeven price for the play and help it compete with opportunities available in the Appalachia portion of the portfolio.
This concludes today's prepared comments. So we'll now turn it back to the operator, who will explain the procedure for asking questions."

We expect that we will do -- our objective is to complete all the DUCs or as many DUCs as we can out of Fayetteville and then, in each of the other 2 assets, retain a level of DUCs only for efficiency. We don't -- when we halted activities at the end of the year, first part of this year, we had a DUC inventory. We then restarted. That's all going fine, and we're just working them off. Since we don't anticipate a large amount of drilling in Fayetteville, we don't need a large amount of inventory in Fayetteville. So you get those to market and begin to get returns on those. In the other 2 areas, you're going to be focused on capturing those that you can get to market in an efficient and timely manner to capitalize on those rising prices while retaining enough that we can be efficient with our plan.

The headline is it's going terrific. Remember, there's 2 components to this. First component on the fracture stimulation side is we want to be as efficient as we can, and we want to get the count to where it optimally suits our budget. The second thing that we talked about -- and this is critical, is the frac intensity or the testing that's going on, on these -- on some of these wells. We're ramping sand loading in a couple cases from 1,000 to 2,000 pounds a foot from 2,000 to 5,000 pounds a foot. And so those -- that testing impacts some of these wells. And to put that much more sand in that many more stages into a well takes longer to do. And so the only issue that we have right now -- and it's not really an issue. I miscalled it. It's an opportunity -- is we're doing some testing related to higher sand loading, which will have positive effects, we expect, on our wells. We've already seen that in West Virginia where we've gone up above 2,000 to almost 3,000 pounds in wells that are already online. And that, combined with how we're landing them and how we're flowing them and all of that is improving their individual performance. Well, we expect that to be the case elsewhere. And a nuance to all that statement is we're, right now, focused on technical limit. So we've already proved up to ourselves that we can get a whole lot more sand in and make a whole lot better wells, which makes them more economic. We want to know how much can you do. And so we focused the folks on that. We'll do those wells and get them online and see and then we'll bring them. And if we go to the place where much higher sand content and stage phasing, et cetera, becomes more of the norm after we test it, then we'll readjust our schedule, let you know what that looks like and go from there. That's the real big piece of that whole calendar issue."

Last year, we added some additional capacity around what we already had, anticipating that you could have some scheduling challenges. I think, further, probably the greatest near-term impact becomes the seasonal differential challenge, especially as production and pricing resumes. And if you get production coming back online, you get the differential challenge. We're trying to manage that through basis hedging. Our overall transportation portfolio pricing is very low in that area.

I remain in the same place that I spoke about earlier, though, is that you have some targeted testing, and if that opens up new frontiers, then we put that into the mix. You have some land capture in the 2 other divisions, not Fayetteville. Absent those and maybe 1 or 2 other things, then you start looking at relative economics to the Northeast. And a big piece of our capital productivity improvement, a big piece of, really, our overall performance improvement is allocating capital to the highest best use of that capital. And today, with current technology and current commercial terms and all the other things that go into that, our 2 Northeast assets, by and large, are -- have that advantage. And so in the first pileup of projects, the majority of it obviously goes to the Northeast. But as you're seeing right now, we have a rig in Fayetteville. It's focusing on Moorefield. It's focusing on some other testing. And we've got some other things we're working on. And then, the rest of the activity is in the other 2 places.

You make major inroads into the water management of any of these divisions and you move the needle. So there's a lot of very exciting testing going on around water management and around different techniques. It can move the dial. So as we work through the remainder of this year and continue this -- the planning for '17, all of that will be taken into account.

And assuming the pipes come in when they're supposed to come in, we can ramp that thing at 35% a year for the next 3 years comfortably. We then wanted to look at where the pipes get built, so committing to the right pipes at the right place to access our acreage was really important. And then, we stepped back. 16 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity, excluding expansion capacity being built all in one area is a lot of capacity. And taking on long-term commitments, which end up having to drill into or whatever, didn't make any sense to us at all. And so we said we'll wait because we do believe and, I think the industry shares this with us, that there will come an inflection point in the -- all this expansion where the cost of those and especially if you get into any expansion-type capacity, the cost of that comes down. and we will leg into that at a later date as that cost does come down and the terms get more rationalized.

And so we're -- we'll continue to watch that but feel very confident about our position as it stands today."

Where we can, in some places, lateral length is limited to -- by unit size or how the -- how that is made up. We've done lateral length testing up past 12,500 feet. We're analyzing that the -- and we were up virtually 100% in zone and all the things that we've talked about. And what we're doing is analyzing that flowback. We have 4 of those wells, I believe, in 2 different areas are some of our longest that we have. And you want -- the trick is making sure that you're getting the contribution out of the full lateral length and that when you rerun economics, so it's not about flow rate or IP or any of that. It's about well economics. You make sure that these extended-reach laterals, you're getting the contribution out of the whole thing for the investment that you're making. And it's a risk-reward balance. But we do -- as we look to block up land, we are consistently -- so for example in the range, we started out in West Virginia a 7,500 foot target lateral. I think some of our latest averages are like 7,800. We'll continue to block up acreage in trade and exchange, so that you can get those out there while we're testing these longer-reach ones. The Moorefield laterals are longer. The Fayetteville well laterals are longer as well. So the trend is longer, but we will make sure that value per risked foot and all that makes sense."

And the opportunity that, that affords the company is certainly a bright one. We're seeing the application of commercial and technical and operating expertise be applied in an even greater pace that is unlocking additional opportunities. Certainly, our midstream business is integral to that. The agility that we have, the ability to move back and forth, the ability to be flexible as a corporation, again, not drilling into somebody else's midstream contract or not drilling into the firm transportation that you've overcommitted to, any of those kinds of things. It's a balance. And I think we see that Fayetteville is a vast resource that continues to generate cash flow. Any of these assets are certainly assets that you look, say can I get greater value doing something different than I'm doing now. And we work that routinely. Where are they on their cost curve? Or you take a subset of it. We did a transaction in West Virginia on some acreage we weren't even going to get to until 2023. So it wasn't that it was not economic. It's just so long-dated that why -- if we're able to accelerate that value at a good value then it [indiscernible] do it. So I think we continue to look at it as the answer. We don't want to put ourselves in a place where we do a because we've done b. We want them to be economically synchronized, and we think that you add more value in the long run."

The good news is that we've positioned each of these assets well. And we think that they're each set up to where you can expect to have even more results and even better results as we go forward in time. With the stability that we've recaptured in the company this year, we've got a clearer path to capturing and delivering value-creating growth. And we're doing all of that in a rising gas price environment. And positioning yourself to capitalize on a rising gas price environment is a big piece of that objective. Our portfolio's primed to deliver impressive well results as we learn from all the things we've talked about today. And our firm transportation portfolio allows us the flexibility to maneuver and navigate and work through an ever-changing basis environment and ever-changing regulatory environment and an ever-changing pricing environment. So we'll continue to devise and implement innovative drilling and operating techniques and efficiencies. We will -- we are -- we have what we call around here an aggressive assault on improving margin.

You have it on the cost side. And we're committed to continue to increase that margin.
