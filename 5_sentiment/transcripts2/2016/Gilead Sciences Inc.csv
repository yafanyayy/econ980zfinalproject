2015 was an exceptional year for Gilead, with progress in a number of therapeutic areas, most notably in the development of TAF-based therapies for HIV and hepatitis B and new agents for the treatment of liver disease. Gilead is entering 2016 from a position of financial strength, a portfolio of 20 marketed products that address significant segment medical needs, including Genvoya, the most recent to be introduced; and the growing pipeline with multiple programs for which milestones are expected during the coming year, including regulatory decisions on 2 products for HIV and one each for HCV and HPV. 
As you all know, we announced on Friday that John Milligan will be appointed CEO, a role he will assume in a few weeks. I will be taking on the role of Executive Chairman and will continue to be actively engaged in the company. John Milligan has been with Gilead for more than 25 years and, over that time, has built expertise in every functional area of the company's operations.

I'm honored and excited by the opportunity to lead this company and the great team we have. In my new role, I will continue to work hard to help Gilead's business grow beyond antivirals imaging and enter new therapeutic areas for the betterment of patients. 
[indiscernible] Greatly appreciated that John Merman closely involved as the Executive Chairman. 
Turning to the business and result of the quarter. Genvoya, the company's first TAFs single-tablet original for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, is approved in the U.S. and Europe. Genvoya achieved preferred status in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines within the first 2 weeks after approval, which speaks to the profile of the product and the important needs it addresses. 
Two other TAF-based regimens are pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU. F/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of April 7 and in the EU, a CHMP opinion could be adopted in the first quarter of this year. RF/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of March 1, and a CHMP opinion is expected in the second half of this year. This means that Gilead could launch 2 new TAF is in a products in the coming months giving patients a wider range of options for the treatment of their HIV. 
During the last quarter, 4 Phase III studies of GS 9883, Gilead proprietary integrase inhibitor, combined in a single-tablet cover with F/TAF were initiated. Two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of GS 9883F F/TAF in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive adults. One will compare GS 983 F/TAF to Triumeq, and the other will compare GS 9883 F/TAF to [indiscernible] plus F/TAF. 
Two other studies will evaluate patients who switched from Triumeq or a boosted PI to GS 9883 F/TAF. 
Phase II data on GS 9883 F/TAF will be presented later conference in the safety enough to their activity over 48 weeks of treatment. Analysis of the data through 24 weeks indicated that an FCR of GS 9883 F/TAF may represent a valuable option for many patients. And based on current timelines, the U.S. NDA and EU MAA could be filed in the second half of next year. 
Last month, Gilead submitted a new drug application in the U.S. and a Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for TAF as a treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Regulatory submissions are also expected in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and India this year and China in the first half of 2017. 
Phase III study results reflect high efficacy and improved renal and bone safety parameters, similar to those seen in the clinical studies evaluating TAF-based regimens for HIV. 
Beyond TAF for HCV, several ongoing research programs are focused on therapies with finite duration of dosing that achieved long-term viral suppression. The first-in-human approach where multiple programs are evaluating different ways to activate immune system to eliminate  infected effective hepatocytes. The most advanced is our TLR-7 agonist, GS-9620, which is currently in 2 Phase II studies. Other approaches include the combination of novel direct-acting antiviral and agents that modulate cccDNA transcription. Two of these new programs may enter into clinical trials in the first half of 2016. 
In hepatitis C, Gilead's focus remains on advancing care of people with disease regardless of genotypes or disease severity. This launch Sovaldi December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 770,000 individuals around the world have been treated with sofosbuvir-based regimen. 
In November, FDA approved Harvoni for expanded use in patients with genotype 4, 5 and 6 chronic HCV infection and patients co-infected with HIV. In addition, Harvoni plus [indiscernible] for 12 weeks was approved as an alternate therapy to 24 weeks of Harvoni for treatment experience genotype-1 patients with sclerosis. 
Investigational once-daily pan-genotypic combinations studied for the treatment of genotypes 1 through 6 chronic HCV infection, including patients with compensated and decompensated sclerosis. FDA granted priority review and has set a PDUFA date of June 28, 2016. 
Additionally, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been granted accelerated assessment in the EU. If approved, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir will represent a significant step forward, particularly for genotype 3 patients, and will also become the first and only regimen offering high SVR8 which 12 weeks of treatment of all for patients with HCV genotypes. 
The advances in treatment of HCV with Sovaldi and Harvoni over the past 2 years have allowed Gilead to work with governments and public health experts on eradication strategies amongst specific populations and geographies. Programs such as those ongoing in the Republic of Georgia and Iceland could serve as examples for other governments around the world seeking to eradicate HCV. 
Public-health programs to prevent HIV transmission are also underway, including efforts to raise awareness about the use of Truvada for PrEP. Today, more than 40,000 patients in the U.S. are receiving Truvada for preventive indication. Yesterday, the MAA was validated for Gilead's type 2 variation of Truvada for PrEP, and it is now under evaluation by the EMA. 
Gilead continues its R&D effort in NASH, or nonalcoholic hepatitis. Phase II studies of [indiscernible], a targeting antibody, are ongoing in patients with NASH and also primary sclerosing cholangitis. The data Monitoring Committee for these studies recently met and recommends the continuation of the studies, which have a 96-week endpoint. 
Additionally, clinical studies of the FXR agonist, GS 9674, have been initiated, with the first patients receiving treatment in Q4 of last year. 
Moving to oncology. Gilead continues to study [indiscernible] in several hematological disorders. Phase III study results show adding [indiscernible] to [indiscernible] and rituximab provides statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free and overall survival compared to the domestic and rituximab alone. 
Supplemental regulatory filings are planned in the U.S. and Europe early this year to include these important new data. 
Beyond [indiscernible], Gilead also is exploring novel combinations of investigational therapies for a range of cancers, including 4 classes of kinase inhibitors through PI3K, 6 Jack and BTK, that each target different signaling pathways. 
Progress has been made in inflammation as well. Gilead entered into a global partnership with Galapagos [ph] late last year for the development and commercialization of [indiscernible], a JAK 1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Phase II trial data shows that [indiscernible] has the potential to be an effective and well-tolerated oral therapy for patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Phase III studies of [indiscernible] in RA and Crohn's are planned to start later this year. 
In summary, Gilead's substantial pipeline offers numerous opportunities for continued growth, both in the short and longer term, and the financial strength of the company allows us to be thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing partnerships or acquisitions that will further expand the future portfolio of products. 
2016 will be a busy year for Gilead, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for the support in this transition and for their continued hard work and dedication. Paul Carter will now provide a commercial update."

Gilead achieved $8.4 billion in net product revenue in the fourth quarter, representing 16% year-over-year growth. U.S. product revenue reached $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which is down 14% from the third quarter and down 12% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to a decrease of HCV revenue. 
European product revenue reached $1.7 billion in the quarter, which was in line with the prior quarter and up 22% on a year-over-year basis despite the negative 11% foreign exchange impact. 
For the rest of the world, product revenues were $1.9 billion for the full quarter and $3.8 billion for the full year, driven largely by HCV launches in Japan. 
Beginning with hepatitis C. Total HCV product revenue reached $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter. 
In the next few minutes, I'll describe the results for the quarter 4 by region and also describe how we're thinking about the year ahead. 
In the United States, HCV product revenue totaled $2.4 billion, which is down 27% from the third quarter. This decline was impacted by substantially lower VA sales in the fourth quarter. 
In quarter 3, Congress allocated an additional $500 million to the VA for HCV treatment, and this was fully utilized in quarter 3. New patients in the VA were very limited during quarter 4 due to the uncertainty of future funding at that time. Congress has since allocated substantial funding of $1.5 billion for the fiscal year, which will allow treatments in the VA to resume in this quarter. 
In terms of patient numbers in 2015, nearly 250,000 U.S. HCV patients started treatment, with more than 90% of these patients receiving Gilead HCV therapies. 
As I commented last quarter, there were an unusually large number of patient starts in the U.S. in the first quarter of last year, indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment to many warehouse patients, followed by a flattening of patients in the remaining quarters of the year. 
Looking to the future, even with nearly 400,000 patients treated since the launch of Sovaldi, there remain more than 3 million HCV-infected individuals in the U.S. who have let yet to be treated, approximately half of whom are diagnosed according to recent CDC data. 
Long-term education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis and the flow of HCV-infected patients into treated care are important and will play out over many years, as we know from our experience in HIV. 
Turning to Europe. Hepatitis C revenue was $846 million in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that more than 110,000 patients were treated wit sofosbuvir-based regiments in 2015. 
Following the normal summer seasonality in quarter 3, there was an increase of patient starts throughout Europe in quarter 4, including in the U.K. following the final appraisal determination for Harvoni from Nice. A number of countries in Europe have volume-based incentives of Sovaldi and Harvoni, encourage a high number of patients being treated. 
In quarter 4, the growth in revenues did not match the growth in patient starts because of the impact of certain volume-based agreements, combined with adverse foreign exchange movements. 
In Japan, hepatitis C revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion. Since the launch of Sovaldi in May and the launch of Harvoni in September, sales of $1.9 billion have been generated in Japan, with Harvoni representing more than $1 billion of that number. 
In late December, pricing and reimbursement negotiations of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Australia were finalized. 
There were a number of variables to consider when thinking about HCV patient numbers and revenues for 2016. Patient starts in the U.S. will likely be similar to 2015 existing levels both observed in the second half and extrapolated for the full year, while the Europe numbers will continue to grow as early launch markets stabilize and new markets ramp up treatment. 
In Japan, patient numbers are difficult to predict because launches are still in the early stages, and to some extent, we are likely seeing the impact of warehoused patients. 
In the rest of the world, we're excited to bring -- to reach new patients in several new markets, notably in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America. 
As we think about revenue, we anticipate that variables to consider include potential shortage duration of treatment, the full year effect of payer contracts in the U.S. and buy Price volume deals in some European markets, which may allow more patients to be treated at a lower per-patient cost. 
We also anticipate that payer mix in the U.S. may shake slightly towards public payers, while in Japan, new legislation will likely result in lower pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni. 
We are confident in the long-term sustainability of HCV markets worldwide. Despite the number of patients treated today, there are still millions of HCV-infected individuals who have yet to be treated and many that have yet to be diagnosed. There are significant efforts underway by industry, governments and patient organizations to increase rates of diagnosis and linkage to care. 
We're also confident in our competitive position as we enter 2016. Sovaldi and Harvoni are breakthrough therapies that set the bar with cure rates of up to 99%. Data presented at ASLD in November showed real world cure rates with Harvoni that met or exceeded what was predicted by clinical trials, including the 8-week duration of therapy. 
We also look forward to launching our next HCV product, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, in due course around the world starting later this year. 
Turning to HIV. HIV product revenue reached $3 billion in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., revenues were $2 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter and up 5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the continued demand for Stribild, [indiscernible], Truvada and the recent launch of Genvoya. 
Stribild has a strong underlying prescription demand, with year-on-year growth of 40% and 12%, respectively. 
7 out of 10 HIV patients in the U.S. initiate therapy with a Gilead product, and nearly 6 in 10 receive a Gilead single-tablet regimen. 
Genvoya sales have been very encouraging in the first few weeks of launch. Revenues for the quarter were $44 million, with early product uptake well ahead of the launch of Stribild at the same time points. 
Access and reimbursement have been consistent with historical norms in HIV, and the rapid addition of Genvoya to the DHS gap treatment guidelines as a preferred first-line treatment reinforces the safety and efficacy profile observed in clinical trials and reflected in nonproduct label. 
In Europe, HIV revenues were $747 million for the quarter, up 4% from the third quarter, driven by the sales of Stribild and [indiscernible], with a slight decline year-over-year caused by foreign exchange. 
7 out of 10 patients in Europe also started on Truvada-based backbone in 2015. 
Genvoya was launched in Europe in November. Similar to the U.S., we have seen encouraging early product uptake in the 6 countries launched during the fourth quarter. 
A final comment on HIV is that the commercial organization is getting ready to execute the launches of RF/TAF and F/TAF in the next months. 
Turning to other therapy areas. Total revenue for product outside of HIV and HCV, which includes [indiscernible], AmBisome, [indiscernible], Letairis and Ranexa, totaled $1.9 billion in 2015 and grew 16% year-over-year. 
Over the last quarter, progress has been made in the area of cardiovascular disease. Since the inclusion of the ambition data in the Letairis label, we've seen a great deal of interest in engagement from  the medical community. 
Revenue for the full year for Letairis received -- reached $700 million, and market share for the products among patients initiating therapy is nearly 50%. 
In closing, Gilead had a remarkable 2015. The commercial organization's excited about the opportunities across all of Gilead's therapeutic areas, both in the near  term and over the longer term, to help many more patients around the world. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Robin."

We are pleased to share full year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results and provide 2016 guidance. For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.5 billion, up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014",1033,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share full year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results and provide 2016 guidance. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.5 billion, up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion or $3.18 per diluted share compared to $3.5 billion or $2.18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $3.32 per share, up 37% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Turning to fiscal year 2015. Full year total revenues were $32.6 billion, up 31% year-over-year. 
Net income for the year was $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share compared to $21 billion or $7.35 per diluted share for 2014. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $12.61 per share for the year, up 56% year-over-year. 
Product sales during the year were $32.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year. HCV product sales increased year-over-year to $19.1 billion, up 54%. And non-HCV product sales increased year-over-year to $13 billion, up 8%. 
The increase in HCV product sales for the year was primarily driven by sales of Harvoni, which launched in October 2014. Further, the annualized HCV gross-to-net- estimate that was shared with you during the Q4 earnings call a year ago is on target and reflected in our 2015 results. 
Non-HCV product sales growth for the year was primarily driven by Stribild and Complera [indiscernible], partially offset by [indiscernible]. 
Turning to expenses for the full year 2015. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.2 billion, up 17% compared to the prior year, driven by expenses to support our growth and geographic expansion. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year was 16.2%, which was lower compared to guidance due to the permanent extension of the federal R&D credit that was passed in December. If you recall, the permanent extension of the credit was not included in 2015 guidance. 
Cash flows from operations were $20.3 billion for the full year 2015 and $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter. 
With respect to shareholder return, $3.1 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase 29 million shares during the quarter, bringing total 2015 share repurchases to 10,095,000,000 [ph] shares. Including the Q2 2015 warrant settlement of $3.9 billion dividends and share repurchases, Gilead has returned more than $15 billion in cash to shareholders in 2015. 
Earlier today, we announced an increase of the quarterly dividend from $0.43 per share to $0.47 per share, which will become effective in the second quarter of 2016, subject to a declaration by the Board of Directors. 
Additionally, the Board authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program to be initiated after the completion of the current $15 billion program, which, as of December 31, 2015, had $8 billion remaining. 
Also announced was the utilization of $5 billion of the current program to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, which is expected to be completed in the next 3 months. This is in addition to the ongoing open-market share repurchases that have continued under the current share repurchase program since January of this year. 
The increase in the dividend and increased level of share repurchases underscore the confidence of the Board and management in the strength of the business and future cash flows. 
Since 2010, in addition to financing ongoing R&D programs and business development activities, more than 75% of free cash flows were returned to shareholders, and share count was reduced in excess of 20% while maintaining and improving investment-grade credit ratings, which Gilead values. 
Looking forward, the plan is to continue to return a significant component of free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and increases to our dividend over time. 
As in the past, there could be future periods of time when share repurchases are reduced due to acquisitions and other pipeline investments that are prioritized to drive future long-term growth. This strategy provides agility and financial flexibility to support R&D investments as well as any future acquisitions or partnership opportunities we may consider. 
Finally, I would like to cover full year 2016 non-GAAP financial guidance summarized on Slide 51 in the earnings presentation available on the Gilead website. 
Product sales are expected to be in the range of $30 billion to $31 billion. Guides for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy and HCV patients start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PAS, FSS, Medicaid and the VA. 
Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 88% to 90%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion as a result of the continued investment in our product pipeline. This includes the financial impact of the Galapagos calibration, or collaboration, which closed in January. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. This reflects an estimated $200 million increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee. Please note that 2015 included a favorable adjustment of approximately $100 million based on the receipt of the 2015 invoice from the IRS. 
For the full year, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This includes the impact of the federal R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015 and the increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee, which is not tax-deductible. 
Full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.16 per share. 
In closing, we are pleased with 2015 accomplishments across the organization. Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.

So I think I said in the script that we should anticipate in the United States that 2016 revenues should be more or less based on the second half of 2015 extrapolated for the year. I also mentioned that we had some lumpiness in the second half of the year due to the purchasing profile of the VA. And we anticipate that, that will smooth out during the course of this year. I've also said numerous times before that in quarter 1 last year we had a very large bogus of warehoused patients being treated which, of course, we're unlikely to see again. But to some extent, that gets substituted as the payers, commercial payers, that we are well-known are beginning to loosen restrictions. So there's a few dynamics in the U.S., but I think the way that I would look at it is a fairly flat stable, perhaps more generally growing number of patients going into treatment. If we see public players stepping up like Medicaid and perhaps a correctional facility to start treating more patients, then patients down could go higher than that in 2016. There's a few other factors, which I also mentioned as we think about the revenue aspect as opposed to just patient numbers. The next 6 [ph] patients, GT1 patients are qualified are more likely to be using the 8-week HARVONI treatment duration. And of course, therefore, revenue per patient will come down proportionately. Having said that, the offset is that budgets for treating patients go up, and we would like to think that more patients could be treated. So I think that's sort of the main thing. I think from a competitive point of view, we feel very confident that our label is very strong and that we are very much supported by the real world data that we've seen since the launch of Harvoni and with very high SVR rates and  a very strong safety profile, at least as good, if not better, than the one that was used in our registrational trials. So I think we feel good about the year. The U.S. is fairly steady and possibly could even grow, as I said with, some restrictions, loosen and from them in public payers step up. Around the world, as I mentioned, we expect patient numbers to grow in Europe. They started to stabilize in the major markets now and again following more or less the shape of the curve in the U.S., where there is a large lump because of warehoused operations being treated initially with. That is smoothing out now. And many of the smaller markets are now beginning to come on onstream. And so we should see a number of patients in the U.S. but the same thing, we'll like to see more patients be treated with shorter durations. And I also mentioned, we have a number of price and volume agreements in place, which are delivered in incentive wise to encourage high volumes of patients being treated but at a lower revenue per patient, if you like. So we should think about that. And then around the rest of the world, Japan, I mentioned, very early days.

And we're moving our pipeline along as fast as we can, and as we mentioned, there's some very interesting opportunities for us. So we do see very good opportunities in organic growth, and I have great confidence in HIV portfolio that with the 3 STRSs  we talked about on the call today and the other STR being developed by our partner, Johnson, that will have very -- a meaningful continued growth of both patients and revenues in the future in HIV. I think that's a very important thing for us. We're continuing to accelerate HCV to bring it SOF/VEL to market and work in  more countries than we ever have before. So those are important additions and some things current markets. We're very excited about [indiscernible].. I think there's good opportunities in inflammatory diseases. We have spoken about is very much in the past, and sort of quietly, we've been investigating our MMP-9 antibody, 5745, which we didn't talk about on this call, which now has positive data in 3 of the 4 indications we've looked at an in inflammatory diseases, with the fourth under investigation. And so not only do we have [indiscernible] potentially for our inflammatory disease, but we have an antibody, which has a mechanism, which is very refractory to current care and could be a very good beginning to inflammatory disease franchise. Of course, you mentioned the kinase inhibitor that we have for oncology. There's always a potential that those could be useful in various diseases in combination with [indiscernible] as well, and we will explore that, although I still think the best value of it is the fact that it's a very good-looking drug and some very positive data in Crohn's disease. So we are going down the pathway of inflammatory disease by virtue of the successes we have in our pipeline and successes in licensing. Oncology, it's -- [indiscernible] has been a good start for us. We really need to continue to try to ramp up our efforts in this area and to continue to broaden the areas we want to work in. It's pretty clear we have to do additional partnerships or find other avenues to broaden the revenu stream there for the future. And as Robin mentioned, with our balance sheet, we have to create flexibly of the new partnerships or acquisitions that could get us there, so that would be an important consideration for us. That may not be the only avenue. We also look at other areas where we can bring in different programs, potentially accelerating the revenue as soon as possible in some of those areas when those things are available. And if the environment has shifted dramatically in our favor, we're doing those sorts of partnerships and whatnot. So that's a good -- 2016, I believe, will be a good year for us because of the strengths of the underlying business and the economic uncertainty that's driving the market today."

We had the first competitive coming to the hepatitis C space. And I think the managed care view at that time was that these products were interchangeable and could be treated by commodities, to some extent, which really triggered the pricing and negotiations we saw in early part of last year. That has been proven to be a totally incorrect view of the hepatitis C products. And what we've seen, fortunately, with Harvoni, in particular, is a real-world data really strengthened its position and people's understanding what our product does. It has curious people with an incredibly high SVR rates, and the safety profile has been extremely good and in line, if not better, than its label. That hasn't been the case of competitive products so far. In fact, we've seen safety warnings added to labels, and we've seen a differentiation. And that's played out in the market. So I think as we see our new competitors are coming into the market, now payers are really thinking this through. There isn't any kind of sort of instinctive reactions. People have been very thoughtful, and we noticed because we have a very close discussions with the managed care main players. And we're working with them as they think through this.

In quarter 1, 2015, there were 72, and that really was the peak of this warehoused patient  part of the curve, then dropped down into quarter 2 of 65,000. There were still some of those warehoused patients coming through. And then quarter 3 was 62,000, and quarter 4 was 50,000. We know that in quarter 3, a lot of patients were treated by the VA who, by the way, seems to be incredibly efficient in getting patients into treatment. And we know that in quarter 4, very few patients were initiated by the VA. So I think if you do the basic math on that, you get up to about 230-something-thousand forecasting that forward into 2016 if you assume the VA picks up. Then I think this sort of merges into the second part of your question, which is what happens with Medicaid and other public payers who, today, have really treated very, very few people. So our assumption is they're still not going to treat that many more patients this year, it's the way we're thinking forward, but we're hopeful that, that will be a trend that improves over time, that people start to see how effective these drugs are, and particularly, the 8-week usage of Harvoni, which, as I mentioned, in the real world seems to be incredibly effective and offers very good value.

So they're diagnosed with HCV and they're registered with a treater. So if you do the math on that, clearly, that 360,000 patients coming into treatment a year, and we're seeing treatment levels are lower than that. And what that speaks to is the types of patients are different amongst that 360,000 group. And that sort of pathway to actual treatment varies considerably. But that does appear, again, doing the math and assuming the research is correct, that there is a line at the door of patients that still need to be treated and are acceptable. I don't think those are the people that are, let's say, out of society or -- these are people that are accessible and for one reason or another reason, that they haven't started treatment yet.

I think the good fortune to can help us grow into those areas. And so the answer is yes, we're very interested in acquiring assets through partnerships potentially acquisition that could help us grow in those areas.

And so we have the flexibilities are to be to manage the  balance sheet, can manage to be patient to not be forced in doing something before we want to. And so we are looking in the area of oncology. We're looking at an additional things in inflammatory diseases, things that are adjacent to there, to see what opportunities might fit within our portfolio so that we could create a really strong franchise like we have in HIV and HCV with multiple options for success in those areas. Some will depend on what happens in our portfolio this year as we make progress with our MMP-9 antibody or not. Obviously, we're looking heavily in NASH with the FXR agonist. We're very interested in liver diseases, so that's a very important area for us. And we'll continue to try to bolster those to make sure that the company has the assets necessary to have the progress in the future. Is there a shopping list? There's always a list that you have in your mind or sometimes on paper. That's probably dangerous. So it rests on my mind in which I think about things that will be important for us or things that could have the right opportunity at the right price.

But it is interesting to note that our most recent data still suggests there's about 1.5 million patients diagnosed in America, which means that -- and that was about 1.6 million when we launched Sovaldi. So that implies that there has been a refilling of that bucket, a replenishment, if you will, but it's right away by this category of patient as more patients are being diagnosed and working their way through the system. So we don't have a firm handle on the exact numbers, so that's the closest approximation I can give you. But it does suggest that there's a pretty good flow of patients were now becoming aware in coming to at least be diagnosed. We don't know that characterization of those patients are as earlier question about the weather patients eligible for treatment since many of the Medicaid are not treating many patients, and that's something we are 20 figure out right now."

All of the main countries, the big countries in Europe have now gone through their sort of warehouse points of the launch tried to do with the patient flow and are getting more stable patient flows, but are growing. So I think that's my main point. We anticipate higher numbers of patients in 2016 over '15. And countries like the U.K. really didn't treat very many patients at all so far, but they are now beginning to ramp up. And then some of the smaller countries, Netherlands, Australia, are beginning to grow patient numbers. Having said that, I also mentioned earlier price volume agreements. These are set up to try to encourage more patients being treated. But obviously, the flipside to those arrangements is that the price for patient comes down, and there's better value to treat more patients. The other thing, I think, is a real-world data with 8 weeks of Harvoni treatment. It looks stronger and stronger and is more convincing to European payers. And therefore, they will also use that opportunity to try and treat more patients, but of course, at a lower revenue per patient."

I'm also greatly appreciative to have that John will remain closely involved as the Executive Chairman. 
Turning to the business and results of the quarter. Genvoya, the company's first TAF-based single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, is approved in the U.S. and Europe. Genvoya achieved preferred status in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines within the first 2 weeks after approval, which speaks to the profile of the product and the important need it addresses. 
Two other TAF-based regimens are pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU. F/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of April 7. And in the EU, a CHMP opinion could be adopted in the first quarter of this year. R/F/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of March 1, and a CHMP opinion is expected in the second half of this year. This means that Gilead could launch 2 new TAF-containing products in the coming months, giving patients a wider range of options for the treatment of their HIV. 
During the last quarter, 4 Phase III studies of GS-9883, Gilead's proprietary integrase inhibitor combined in the single-tablet regimen with F/TAF were initiated. Two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of GS-9883/F/TAF in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive adults. One will compare GS-9883/F/TAF to Triumeq, and the other will compare GS-9883/F/TAF to dolutegravir plus F/TAF. Two other studies will evaluate patients who switch from Triumeq or a boosted PI to GS-9883/F/TAF. 
Phase II data on GS-9883/F/TAF will be presented later this year at a medical conference describing the safety and antiviral activity over 48 weeks of treatment. Analysis of the data through 24 weeks indicated that an FCR of GS-9883/F/TAF may represent a valuable option for many patients. And based on current time lines, the U.S. NDA and EU MAA could be filed in the second half of next year. 
Last month, Gilead submitted a new drug application in the U.S. and a Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for TAF as a treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Regulatory submissions are also expected in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and India this year and China in the first half of 2017. 
Phase III study results reflect high efficacy and improved renal and bone safety parameters, similar to those seen in the clinical studies evaluating TAF-based regimens for HIV. 
Beyond TAF for HPV, several ongoing research programs are focused on therapies with finite duration of dosing that achieve long-term viral suppression. The first is an immunomodulatory approach, where multiple programs are evaluating different ways to activate immune system to eliminate infected hepatocytes. The most advanced is our TLR-7 agonist, GS-9620, which is currently in 2 Phase II studies. Other approaches include the combination of novel direct-acting antivirals and agents that modulate cccDNA transcription. Two of these new programs may enter into clinical trials in the first half of 2016. 
In hepatitis C, Gilead's focus remains on advancing care of people with the disease regardless of genotype or disease severity. With the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 770,000 individuals around the world have been treated with sofosbuvir-based regimen.
In November, FDA approved Harvoni for expanded use in patients with genotype 4, 5 and 6 chronic HCV infection and the patients co-infected with HIV. In addition, Harvoni plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was approved as an alternate therapy to 24 weeks of Harvoni for treatment experience genotype-1 patients with cirrhosis. 
Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir is an investigational once-daily pan-genotypic combinations studied for the treatment of genotype 1 through 6 chronic HCV infection, including patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. FDA granted priority review and has set a PDUFA date of June 28, 2016.
Additionally, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir has been granted accelerated assessment in the EU. If approved, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir will represent a significant step forward, particularly for genotype 3 patients. It would also become the first and only regimen offering high SVR8, with 12 weeks of treatment for patients with all HCV genotypes. 
The advances in treatment of HCV with Sovaldi and Harvoni over the past 2 years have allowed Gilead to work with governments and public health experts on eradication strategies among specific populations and geographies. Programs such as those ongoing in the Republic of Georgia and Iceland could serve as examples for other governments around the world seeking to eradicate HCV. 
Public-health programs to prevent HIV transmission are also underway, including efforts to raise awareness about the use of Truvada for PrEP. Today, more than 40,000 patients in the U.S. are receiving Truvada for its preventive indication. Yesterday, the MAA was validated for Gilead's type 2 variation of Truvada for PrEP, and it is now under evaluation by the EMA. 
Gilead continues its R&D efforts in NASH, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Phase II studies of simtuzumab, a LOXL2 targeting antibody, are ongoing in patients with NASH and also primary sclerosing cholangitis. The data monitoring committee for these studies recently met and recommended the continuation of the studies, which have a 96-week endpoint. 
Additionally, clinical studies of the FXR agonist, GS-9674, have been initiated, with the first patients receiving treatment in Q4 of last year. 
Moving to oncology. Gilead continues to study Zydelig in several hematological disorders. Phase III study results show adding Zydelig to bendamustine and rituximab provides statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free and overall survival compared to bendamustine and rituximab alone. 
Supplemental regulatory filings are planned in the U.S. and Europe early this year to include these important new data. 
Beyond Zydelig, Gilead also is exploring novel combinations of investigational therapies for a range of cancers, including 4 classes of kinase inhibitors through PI3K, Syk, JAK and BTK, that each target different signaling pathways. 
Progress has been made in inflammation as well. Gilead entered into a global partnership with Galapagos late last year for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a JAK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Phase II trial data shows that filgotinib has the potential to be an effective and well-tolerated oral therapy for patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Phase III studies of filgotinib in RA and Crohn's are planned to start later this year. 
In summary, Gilead's substantial pipeline offers numerous opportunities for continued growth, both in the short and longer term, and the financial strength of the company allows us to be thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing partnerships or acquisitions that will further expand the future portfolio of products.

Gilead achieved $8.4 billion in net product revenue in the fourth quarter, representing 16% year-over-year growth. U.S. product revenue reached $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which is down 14% from the third quarter and down 12% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to a decrease of HCV revenue.
European product revenue reached $1.7 billion in the quarter, which was in line with the prior quarter and up 22% on a year-over-year basis despite the negative 11% foreign exchange impact. 
For the rest of the world, product revenues were $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.8 billion for the full year, driven largely by HCV launches in Japan. 
Beginning with hepatitis C. Total HCV product revenue reached $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter. 
In the next few minutes, I'll describe the results for the quarter 4 by region and also describe how we're thinking about the year ahead. 
In the United States, HCV product revenue totaled $2.4 billion, which is down 27% from the third quarter. This decline was impacted by substantially lower VA sales in the fourth quarter. 
In quarter 3, Congress allocated an additional $500 million to the VA for HCV treatment, and this was fully utilized in quarter 3. New patient starts in the VA were very limited during quarter 4 due to the uncertainty of future funding at that time. Congress have since allocated substantial funding of $1.5 billion for the fiscal year, which will allow treatments in the VA to resume in this quarter. 
In terms of patient numbers, in 2015, nearly 250,000 U.S. HCV patients started treatment, with more than 90% of these patients receiving Gilead HCV therapies. As I commented last quarter, there were an unusually large number of patient starts in the U.S. in the first quarter of last year, indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment for many warehouse patients, followed by a flattening of patients in the remaining quarters of the year. 
Looking to the future, even with nearly 400,000 patients treated since the launch of Sovaldi, there remain more than 3 million HCV-infected individuals in the U.S., who have let yet to be treated, approximately half of whom are diagnosed according to recent CDC data. 
Long-term education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis and the flow of HCV-infected patients into treated care are important and will play out over many years, as we know from our experience in HIV. 
Turning to Europe. Hepatitis C revenue was $846 million in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that more than 110,000 patients were treated with sofosbuvir-based regimens in 2015.
Following the normal sound seasonality in quarter 3, there was an increase of patient starts throughout Europe in quarter 4, including in the U.K. following the final appraisal determination for Harvoni from NICE. A number of countries in Europe have volume-based incentives of Sovaldi and Harvoni, which serve to encourage a high number of patients being treated. 
In quarter 4, the growth in revenues did not match the growth in patient starts because of the impact of certain volume-based agreements, combined with adverse foreign exchange movements. 
In Japan, hepatitis C revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion. Since the launch of Sovaldi in May and the launch of Harvoni in September, sales of $1.9 billion have been generated in Japan, with Harvoni representing more than $1 billion of that number. In late December, pricing and reimbursement negotiations for Sovaldi and Harvoni in Australia were finalized.
There were a number of variables to consider when thinking about HCV patient numbers and revenues for 2016. Patient starts in the U.S. will likely be similar to 2015 levels of observed in the second half and extrapolated for the full year. While the Europe numbers will continue to grow as early launch markets stabilize and new markets ramp up treatment.
In Japan, patient numbers are difficult to predict because launches are still in the early stages, and to some extent, we are likely seeing the impact of warehoused patients. 
In the rest of the world, we're excited to bring -- to reach new patients in several new markets, notably in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. 
As we think about revenue, we anticipate that variables to consider include potential shortage durations of treatment, the full year effect of payer contracts in the U.S. and by price volume deals and some European markets, which may allow more patients to be treated at a lower per patient cost. 
We also anticipate that payer mix in the U.S. may shift slightly towards public payers, while in Japan, new legislation will likely result in lower pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni. 
We're confident in the long-term sustainability of HCV markets worldwide. Despite the number of patients treated to-date, there are still millions of HCV-infected individuals, who've yet to be treated and many other that are yet to be diagnosed. There are significant efforts underway by industry, governments and patient organizations to increase rates of diagnosis and linkage to care. 
We're also confident in our competitive position as we enter 2016. Sovaldi and Harvoni are breakthrough therapies that set the bar with cure rates of up to 99%. Data presented at ASLD in November showed real world cure rates with Harvoni that met or exceeded what was predicted by clinical trials, including the 8-week duration of therapy.  We also look forward to launching our next HCV product, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, in due course around the world starting later this year. 
Turning to HIV. HIV product revenue reached $3 billion in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., revenues were $2 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter and up 5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the continued demand for Stribild, Complera, Truvada and the recent launch of Genvoya. 
Stribild and Complera has a strong underlying prescription demand, with year-on-year growth of 40% and 12%, respectively. 
7 out of 10 HIV patients in the U.S. initiate therapy with a Gilead product, and nearly 6 in 10 receive a Gilead single-tablet regimen. 
Genvoya sales have been very encouraging in the first few weeks of launch. Revenues for the quarter were $44 million, with early product uptake well ahead of the launch of Stribild at the same time point. 
Access and reimbursement have been consistent with historical norms in HIV, and the rapid addition of Genvoya to the DHS gap treatment guidelines as a preferred first-line treatment reinforces the safety and efficacy profile observed in clinical trials and reflected in non-product label. 
In Europe, HIV revenues were $747 million for the quarter, up 4% from the third quarter, driven by the sales of Stribild and Eviplera, with a slight decline year-over-year caused by foreign exchange. 7 out of 10 patients in Europe also started on Truvada-based backbone in 2015. 
Genvoya was launched in Europe in November. Similar to the U.S., we have seen encouraging early product uptake in the 6 countries launched during the fourth quarter. 
A final comment on HIV is that the commercial organization is getting ready to execute the launches of RF/TAF and F/TAF in the next months. 
Turning to other therapy areas. Total revenue for product outside of HIV and HCV, which includes Zydelig, AmBisome, Cayston, Letairis and Ranexa, totaled $1.9 billion in 2015 and grew 16% year-over-year. 
Over the last quarter, progress has been made in the area of cardiovascular disease. Since the inclusion of the AMBITION data in the Letairis label, we've seen a great deal of interest in engagement from  the medical community. 
Revenue for the full year for Letairis received -- reached $700 million, and market share for the products among patients initiating therapy is nearly 50%. 
In closing, Gilead had a remarkable 2015. The commercial organization's excited about the opportunities across all of Gilead's therapeutic areas, both in the near term and over the longer term, to help many more patients around the world. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Robin."

We are pleased to share full year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results and provide 2016 guidance. For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.5 billion, up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014",1034,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share full year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results and provide 2016 guidance. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.5 billion, up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion or $3.18 per diluted share compared to $3.5 billion or $2.18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $3.32 per share, up 37% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Turning to fiscal year 2015. Full year total revenues were $32.6 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Net income for the year was $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share compared to $12.1 billion or $7.35 per diluted share for 2014. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $12.61 per share for the year, up 56% year-over-year. 
Product sales during the year were $32.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year. HCV product sales increased year-over-year to $19.1 billion, up 54%. And non-HCV product sales increased year-over-year to $13 billion, up 8%. 
The increase in HCV product sales for the year was primarily driven by sales of Harvoni, which launched in October 2014. Further, the annualized HCV gross-to-net estimate that was shared with you during the Q4 earnings call a year ago is on target and reflected in our 2015 results. 
Non-HCV product sales growth for the year was primarily driven by Stribild and Complera, Eviplera partially offset by ATRIPLA.
Turning to expenses for the full year 2015. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.2 billion, up 17% compared to the prior year, driven by expenses to support our growth and geographic expansion. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year was 16.2%, which was lower compared to guidance due to the permanent extension of the federal R&D credit that was passed in December. If you recall, the permanent extension of the credit was not included in 2015 guidance. 
Cash flows from operations were $20.3 billion for the full year 2015 and $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter. 
With respect to shareholder return, $3.1 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase 29 million shares during the quarter, bringing total 2015 share repurchases to 10,095,000,000, shares. Including the Q2 2015 warrant settlement of $3.9 billion dividends and share repurchases, Gilead has returned more than $15 billion in cash to shareholders in 2015. 
Earlier today, we announced an increase of the quarterly dividend from $0.43 per share to $0.47 per share, which will become effective in the second quarter of 2016, subject to a declaration by the Board of Directors. 
Additionally, the board authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program to be initiated after the completion of the current $15 billion program, which, as of December 31, 2015, had $8 billion remaining. 
Also announced was the utilization of $5 billion of the current program to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, which is expected to be completed in the next 3 months. This is in addition to the ongoing open market share repurchases that have continued under the current share repurchase bulk program since January of this year. 
The increase in the dividend and increased level of share repurchases underscore the confidence of the board and management in the strength of the business and future cash flows. 
Since 2010, in addition to financing ongoing R&D programs and business development activities, more than 75% of free cash flows were returned to shareholders, and share count was reduced in excess of 20% while maintaining and improving investment-grade credit ratings, which Gilead values. 
Looking forward, the plan is to continue to return a significant component of free cash flows to shareholders via share repurchases and increases to our dividend over time. 
As in the past, there could be future periods of time when share repurchases are reduced due to acquisitions and other pipeline investments that are prioritized to drive future long-term growth. This strategy provides agility and financial flexibility to support R&D investments as well as any future acquisitions or partnership opportunities we may consider. 
Finally, I would like to cover full year 2016 non-GAAP financial guidance summarized on Slide 51 in the earnings presentation available on the Gilead website. 
Product sales are expected to be in the range of $30 billion to $31 billion. Guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy and HCV patients start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 88% to 90%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion as a result of the continued investment in our product pipeline. This includes the financial impact of the Galapagos calibration, or collaboration, which closed in January. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. This reflects an estimated $200 million increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee. Please note that 2015 included a favorable adjustment of approximately $100 million based on the receipt of the 2015 invoice from the IRS. 
For the full year, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This includes the impact of the federal R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015, and the increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee, which is not tax-deductible. 
Full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.16 per share. 
In closing, we are pleased with 2015 accomplishments across the organization. Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.

So I think I said in the script that we should anticipate in the United States that 2016 revenues should be more or less based on the second half of 2015 extrapolated for the year. I also mentioned that we had some lumpiness in the second half of the year due to the purchasing profile of the VA. And we anticipate that, that will smooth out during the course of this year. I've also said numerous times before that in quarter 1 last year, we had a very large bogus of warehouse patients being treated which, of course, we're unlikely to see again. But to some extent, that gets substituted as the payers, commercial payers, that we are well-known are beginning to loosen restrictions. So there's a few dynamics in the U.S., but I think the way that I would look at it is a fairly flat stable, perhaps marginally growing a number of patients flowing into treatment. If we see public payers stepping up like Medicaid and perhaps a correctional facility to start treating more patients, then patient numbers could go higher than that in 2016. There's a few other factors, which I also mentioned as we think about the revenue aspect as opposed to just patient numbers. The less-sick patients, GT1 patients that qualify, are more likely to be using the 8-week Harvoni treatment duration. And of course, therefore, revenue per patient would come down proportionately. Having said that, the offset is that budgets for treating patients go up, and we would like to think that more patients could be treated. So I think that's sort of the main thing. I think from a competitive point of view, we feel very confident that our label is very strong and that we are very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni and with very high SVR rates anda very strong safety profile, at least as good, if not better, than the one that was used in our registrational trials. So I think we feel good about the year. The U.S. is fairly steady and possibly could even grow, as I said, with some restrictions loosens and public payers step up. Around the world, as I mentioned, we expect patient numbers to grow in Europe. They started to stabilize in the major markets now, again, following more or less the shape of the curve in the U.S., where there is a large lump because of warehoused patients being treated initially. That is smoothing out now. And many of the smaller markets are now beginning to come on onstream. And so we should see higher of patients in the Europe. But the same thing, we'll like to see more patients being treated with shorter durations. And as I also mentioned, we do have a number of price volume agreements in place, which are delivered in incentive wise to encourage high volumes of patients being treated but at a lower revenue per patient, if you like. So we should think about that. And then around the rest of the world, Japan, I mentioned, very early days. We're still in that warehousing phase, I think, in Japan, although we're very pleased with the launch of that so far. And then there were various other small markets around the world and medium-size markets, Canada, Australia being one of the medium-sized markets that are yet to launch here. So we have plenty of patients around the world, but there are some other dynamics, as I said, around shorter treatment and, of course, the competitive situation."

And we're moving our pipeline along as fast as we can. And as we mentioned, there's some very interesting opportunities for us. So we do see very good opportunities in organic growth. And I have great confidence in HIV portfolio that with the 3 STRs  we talked about on the call today and the other STR being developed by our partner, Johnson, that will have very -- a meaningful continued growth of both patients and revenues in the future in HIV. I think that's a very important thing for us. We're continuing to accelerate HCV to bring SOF/VEL [indiscernible] to market and try to work in  more countries than we ever have before. So those are important initiatives and things that are current to market. We're very excited about filgotnib. I think there's great opportunities for us in inflammatory diseases. We hadn't spoken about it very much in the past, and sort of quietly, we've been investigating our MMP-9 antibody, 5745, which we didn't talk about on this call, which now has positive data in 3 of the 4 indications we've looked at in inflammatory diseases, with the fourth under investigation. And so not only do we have filgotnib potentially for RA and inflammatory diseases, but we have an antibody, which has a mechanism, which is very refractory to current care and could be a very good beginning to inflammatory disease franchise. Of course, you mentioned the kinase inhibitors that we have for oncology. There's always a potential that those could be useful in various diseases in combination with filgotnib as well, and we will explore that, although I still think the best value of it is the fact that it's a very good-looking drug and some very positive data in Crohn's disease. So we are going down the pathway of inflammatory diseases by virtue of the successes we've had in our pipeline and successes in licensing. Oncology, it's -- Zydelig has been a good start for us. We really need to continue to try to ramp up our efforts in this area and to continue to broaden the areas we want to work in. It's pretty clear we have to do additional partnerships or find other avenues to broaden the revenue stream there for the future. As Robin mentioned, with our balance sheet, we have to create flexibly of the new partnerships or acquisitions that could get us there, and so that would be an important consideration for us. That may not be the only avenue. We also look at other areas where we could can bring in different programs, potentially accelerating the revenue as soon as possible in some of those areas when those things are available. And if the environment has shifted dramatically in our favor, we're doing those sorts of partnerships and whatnot. So that's a good -- 2016, I believe, will be a good year for us because of the strengths of the underlying business and the economic uncertainty that's driving the market today."

I wanted to ask a bit of a 2-part question. One was you gave some guidance here. And remarkably, like the last question, it actually looks like you're a little flattish or whatnot this year. Do you expect, qualitatively, to be growing over the next year? And two, do you expect that this is a bit of trough revenue here? I just wanted to get your view on that. And importantly, when you look at managed care -- second part of the question, look at managed care, given that there's a new competitor onboard, do you expect minimal to no changes or minimal changes in terms of access and things like that? Just given the new competition, can you talk a little bit about that and there's a little bit of nervousness on how that may change things on the payer front?"

We'll -- we, in this business, you almost have to take things 1 year at a time, especially in hepatitis C, as we understand the rate of diagnosis and patients coming in to care, which is there's great opportunity out there with 1.5 million patients, as Paul mentioned, still being diagnosed but not yet under care, so really good opportunities for us. With regard to the competition coming to market, we have a very, very, very strong position. But I'm going to turn this over to Paul because he'd like to give you some of his thoughts on what the competitive landscape looks like versus Harvoni."

I mean, I think if we tossed our minds back 12 months, we had the first competitor coming in to the hepatitis C space. And I think the managed care view at that time was that these products were interchangeable and could be treated by commodities, to some extent, which really triggered off the pricing and negotiations we saw in early part of last year. That has been proven to be a totally incorrect view of the hepatitis C products. And what we've seen, fortunately, with Harvoni, in particular, is the real-world data has really strengthened its position and people's understanding of what that product does. It has -- it cures people at an incredibly high SVR rates, and the safety profile has been extremely good and in line, if not better, than its label. That hasn't been the case of competitor products so far. In fact, we've seen safety warnings added to labels, and we've seen a differentiation. And that's played out in the market. So I think as we see a new competitor coming into the market, now payers are really thinking this through. There isn't any kind of sort of instinctive reactions. People have been very thoughtful, and we noticed because we have very close discussions with the managed care main players. And we're working with them as they think through this. And I think we feel pretty confident that we'll maintain a strong position as we enter 2016."

So first, Paul, maybe, I just want to make sure I understand what you're trying to say with respect to U.S. HCV volumes. If we look at the 2 volumes, the numbers you've given up in the third and the fourth quarter, it's about 105,000 patients together, which is about 210 on a full-year basis, which is below the 236 you guys reported. And if I take the low end of the 47,000, which it sounds like you're saying is too low because of the VA from the fourth quarter, that's 188,000 annualized. So I just -- if you can just give us some direction on -- I'm sure you're not going to tell us a number, around those numbers, just so we're clear on exactly what you're trying to say. And then maybe related to that, can you just specifically address where you think Access is going to go for Medicaid [indiscernible] this year?"

In fact, I'll take you back even into quarter 4, 2014 where we think 46,000 HCV starts were in the market. These are total starts, by the way. In quarter 1, 2015, there were 72. And that really was the peak of this warehoused patient  part of the curve, then dropped down into quarter 2 of 65,000. There were still some of those warehoused patients coming through. And in quarter 3 was 62,000, and quarter 4 was 50,000. We know that in quarter 3, a lot of patients were treated by the VA who, by the way, seems to be incredibly efficient at getting patients into treatment. And we know that in quarter 4, very few patients were initiated by the VA. So I think if you do the basic math on that, you would get up to about 230-something-thousand forecasting that forward into 2016 if you assume that VA picks up. Then I think this sort of merges into the second part of your question, which is what happens with Medicaid and other public payers who, to date, have really treated very, very few people. So our assumption is they're still not going to treat that many more patients this year, is the way we're thinking forward. But we are hopeful that, that will be a trend that improves over time as people start to see how effective these drugs are and, particularly, 8-week usage of Harvoni which, as I mentioned, in the real world, it seems to be incredibly effective and offers very good value. So that's how we're thinking about it. I hope that's clear."

So I wanted to ask about longer-term trends, the evolution of the HCV market. I know it's hard for everyone to get their hands around, but you indicated again there are about 3 million HCV patients in the U.S. that have yet to be treated. About half of those are diagnosed. In terms of new patients that are entering the system, how similar or different are they from the existing patients or those that have already been cured in terms of, I guess, the overall motivation to be treated, fibrosis score insurance coverage. We get a lot of questions on are these future patients actually legitimate candidates in terms of being under the care of a doc, not IV drug users, et cetera. So can you just comment, try to give us a little bit more comfort in how we can be thinking about this longer-term evolution in the U.S.?"

And that number has been remarkably consistent at around -- we have actually 3 different sources of data, and it's around high 20s to 30,000 patients a month have been falling into that category. So they're diagnosed with HCV, and they're registered with a treater. So if you do the math on that, clearly, that's 360,000 patients coming into treatment a year, and we're seeing treatment levels are lower than that. And what that speaks to is the types of patients are different amongst that 360,000 group, and their sort of pathway to actual treatment varies considerably. But it does appear, again, doing the math and assuming the research is correct, that there is a line at the door of patients that still need to be treated and are accessible. I don't think those are the people that are, let's say, out of society or -- these are people that are accessible and for one reason or another reason, they haven't started treatment yet. But there's a strong flow of patients still out there, and I don't think we're anywhere near getting to the point where we're dealing with patients that are extremely difficult, let's say, to manage."

But for the company to grow, we have to work in other areas. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to work at hepatitis B, which is important to us, and there is the potential to cure that disease. We all recognize that as a hard thing to do as well as curing HIV, which is an equally or harder thing to do, perhaps. So that does imply that we have to go outside of antivirals for continued growth, and we're interested in doing that as we've been hiring and growing with new things in our portfolio over a number of years. I think we have some good core teams that can help us grow into those areas. And so the answer is yes, we're very interested in acquiring assets through partnerships or potentially acquisitions that could help us grow in those areas. And with the tripling of our revenue over the last 2 years, the need to do so sooner rather than later is hyped. That being said, we want to get the right assets at the right price. And so we have the flexibilities certainly with our balance sheet in that current business to be patient to get things to not be forced into doing something before we want to. And so we are looking in the area of oncology. We are looking at additional things in inflammatory diseases, things that are adjacent to there, to see what opportunities might fit within our portfolio so that we could create a really strong franchise like we have in HIV and HCV with multiple options for success in those areas. Some of it will depend on what happens in our portfolio this year as we make progress with our MMP-9 antibody or not. Obviously, we're looking heavily at NASH with the FXR agonists. We're very interested in liver diseases, so that's a very important area for us. And we'll continue to try to bolster those to make sure that the company has the assets necessary to have the progress for the future. Is there a shopping list? There's always a list that you have in your mind or sometimes on paper. That's probably dangerous. So mine's in my mind with which I think about things that would be important for us or things that could have the right opportunity at the right price. Whether or not those things ever come to fruition depends on a lot of factors. But clearly, we're going to be very interested in taking a look this year."

But it is interesting to note that our most recent data still suggests there's about 1.5 million patients diagnosed in America, which means that -- and that was about 1.6 million when we launched Sovaldi. So that implies that there has been a refilling of that bucket, a replenishment, if you will. I don't know if buckets are the right term [ph] here. But it is category of patient as more patients are being diagnosed and working their way through the system. So we don't have a firm handle on exact numbers, so that's the closest approximation I can give you. But it does suggest that there's a pretty good flow of patients who are now becoming aware and coming in to at least be diagnosed. We don't know the characterization of those patients.

I guess the first question is in terms of Japanese sales, I understand there's a government-mandated price cut given the revenue that Sovaldi and Harvoni are generating. Can you just walk us through how that flows as of January 1? And can you give us a scale of what we should expect further price cut? And then just to dig down a little more on Merck's pricing and how it impacts you guys. I think we're all surprised by the quickness in the gross to net discount that AbbVie and you had applied for the initial launches. I guess, the question is Merck clearly is going to take a pretty substantial discount versus what you guys have out. Or are you at a point where you're comfortable enough in the profile that you're drawing a line in the sand to say you're essentially not going to be discounting anymore?"

We have a slightly lower market share in Europe than we do in the U.S., and that's because of payer type arrangements that our competitors got in place. The range of market share ranges from 70% to 90%. But I would say on the average would be about 80% of that 140. All of the main countries, the big countries in Europe have now gone through their sort of warehoused points of the launch trajectory with the patient flow and are getting into more stable patient flows, but are growing. So I think that's my main point. We anticipate higher numbers of patients in 2016 over '15. And countries like the U.K. really didn't treat very many patients at all so far, but they are now beginning to ramp up. And then, some of the smaller countries, Netherlands, Austria, are beginning to grow patient numbers. Having said that, I also mentioned earlier price volume agreements. These are set up to try and encourage more patients being treated. But obviously, the flipside to those arrangements is that the price per patient comes down, and there's better value to treat more patients. The other thing, I think, it's the real-world data with 8 weeks of Harvoni treatment. It looks stronger and stronger and is more convincing to European payers. And therefore, they will also use that opportunity to try and treat more patients, but of course, at a lower revenue per patient."

Gilead is entering 2016 from a position of financial strength, a portfolio of 20 marketed products that address significant unmet medical needs, including Genvoya, the most recent product to be introduced, and the growing pipeline with multiple programs for which milestones are expected during the coming year, including regulatory decisions on 2 products for HIV and one each for HCV and HPV.

I'm also greatly appreciative to have that John will remain closely involved as the Executive Chairman. 
Turning to the business and results of the quarter. Genvoya, the company's first TAF-based single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, is now approved in the U.S. and Europe. Genvoya achieved preferred status in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines within the first 2 weeks after approval, which speaks to the profile of the product and the important need it addresses. 
Two other TAF-based regimens are pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU. F/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of April 7. And in the EU, a CHMP opinion could be adopted in the first quarter of this year. R/F/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of March 1, and a CHMP opinion is expected in the second half of this year. This means that Gilead could launch 2 new TAF-containing products in the coming months, giving patients a wider range of options for the treatment of their HIV. 
During the last quarter, 4 Phase III studies of GS-9883, Gilead's proprietary integrase inhibitor combined in the single-tablet regimen with F/TAF were initiated. Two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of GS-9883/F/TAF in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive adults. One will compare GS-9883/F/TAF to Triumeq, and the other will compare GS-9883/F/TAF to dolutegravir plus F/TAF. Two other studies will evaluate patients who switch from Triumeq or a boosted PI to GS-9883/F/TAF. 
Phase II data on GS-9883/F/TAF will be presented later this year at a medical conference describing the safety and antiviral activity over 48 weeks of treatment. Analysis of the data through 24 weeks indicated that an FCR of GS-9883/F/TAF may represent a valuable option for many patients. And based on current time lines, the U.S. NDA and EU MAA could be filed in the second half of next year. 
Last month, Gilead submitted a new drug application in the U.S. and a Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for TAF as a treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Regulatory submissions are also expected in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and India this year and China in the first half of 2017. 
Phase III study results reflect high efficacy and improved renal and bone safety parameters, similar to those seen in the clinical studies evaluating TAF-based regimens for HIV. 
Beyond TAF for HPV, several ongoing research programs are focused on therapies with finite duration of dosing that achieve long-term viral suppression. The first is an immunomodulatory approach, where multiple programs are evaluating different ways to activate immune system to eliminate infected hepatocytes. The most advanced is our TLR-7 agonist, GS-9620, which is currently in 2 Phase II studies. Other approaches include the combination of novel direct-acting antivirals and agents that modulate cccDNA transcription. Two of these new programs may enter into clinical trials in the first half of 2016. 
In hepatitis C, Gilead's focus remains on advancing care of people with the disease regardless of genotype or disease severity. With the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 770,000 individuals around the world have been treated with sofosbuvir-based regimen.
In November, FDA approved Harvoni for expanded use in patients with genotype 4, 5 and 6 chronic HCV infection and the patients co-infected with HIV. In addition, Harvoni plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was approved as an alternate therapy to 24 weeks of Harvoni for treatment experience genotype-1 patients with cirrhosis. 
Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir is an investigational once-daily pan-genotypic combinations studied for the treatment of genotype 1 through 6 chronic HCV infection, including patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. FDA granted priority review and has set a PDUFA date of June 28, 2016.
Additionally, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir has been granted accelerated assessment in the EU. If approved, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir will represent a significant step forward, particularly for genotype 3 patients. It would also become the first and only regimen offering high SVR8, with 12 weeks of treatment for patients with all HCV genotypes. 
The advances in treatment of HCV with Sovaldi and Harvoni over the past 2 years have allowed Gilead to work with governments and public health experts on eradication strategies among specific populations and geographies. Programs such as those ongoing in the Republic of Georgia and Iceland could serve as examples for other governments around the world seeking to eradicate HCV. 
Public-health programs to prevent HIV transmission are also underway, including efforts to raise awareness about the use of Truvada for PrEP. Today, more than 40,000 patients in the U.S. are receiving Truvada for its preventive indication. Yesterday, the MAA was validated for Gilead's type 2 variation of Truvada for PrEP, and it is now under evaluation by the EMA. 
Gilead continues its R&D efforts in NASH, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Phase II studies of simtuzumab, a LOXL2 targeting antibody, are ongoing in patients with NASH and also primary sclerosing cholangitis. The data monitoring committee for these studies recently met and recommended the continuation of the studies, which have a 96-week endpoint. 
Additionally, clinical studies of the FXR agonist, GS-9674, have been initiated, with the first patients receiving treatment in Q4 of last year. 
Moving to oncology. Gilead continues to study Zydelig in several hematological disorders. Phase III study results show adding Zydelig to bendamustine and rituximab provides statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free and overall survival compared to bendamustine and rituximab alone. 
Supplemental regulatory filings are planned in the U.S. and Europe early this year to include these important new data. 
Beyond Zydelig, Gilead also is exploring novel combinations of investigational therapies for a range of cancers, including 4 classes of kinase inhibitors through PI3K, Syk, JAK and BTK, that each target different signaling pathways. 
Progress has been made in inflammation as well. Gilead entered into a global partnership with Galapagos late last year for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a JAK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Phase II trial data shows that filgotinib has the potential to be an effective and  well-tolerated oral therapy for patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Phase III studies of filgotinib in RA and Crohn's are planned to start later this year. 
In summary, Gilead's substantial pipeline offers numerous opportunities for continued growth, both in the short and longer term, and the financial strength of the company allows us to be thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing partnerships or acquisitions that will further expand the future portfolio of products.
2016 will be a busy year for Gilead, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for the support in this transition and for their continued hard work and dedication.
Paul Carter will now provide a commercial update."

Gilead achieved $8.4 billion in net product revenue in the fourth quarter, representing 16% year-over-year growth. U.S. product revenue reached $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which is down 14% from the third quarter and down 12% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to a decrease of HCV revenue.
European product revenue reached $1.7 billion in the quarter, which was in line with the prior quarter and up 22% on a year-over-year basis despite the negative 11% foreign exchange impact. 
For the rest of the world, product revenues were $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.8 billion for the full year, driven largely by HCV launches in Japan. 
Beginning with hepatitis C. Total HCV product revenue reached $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter. 
In the next few minutes, I'll describe the results for the quarter 4 by region and also describe how we're thinking about the year ahead. 
In the United States, HCV product revenue totaled $2.4 billion, which is down 27% from the third quarter. This decline was impacted by substantially lower VA sales in the fourth quarter. 
In quarter 3, Congress allocated an additional $500 million to the VA for HCV treatment, and this was fully utilized in quarter 3. New patient starts in the VA were very limited during quarter 4 due to the uncertainty of future funding at that time. Congress have since allocated substantial funding of $1.5 billion for the fiscal year, which will allow treatments in the VA to resume this quarter. 
In terms of patient numbers, in 2015, nearly 250,000 U.S. HCV patients started treatment, with more than 90% of these patients receiving Gilead HCV therapies. As I commented last quarter, there were an unusually large number of patient starts in the U.S. in the first quarter of last year, indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment for many warehouse patients, followed by a flattening of patients in the remaining quarters of the year. 
Looking to the future, even with nearly 400,000 patients treated since the launch of Sovaldi, there remain more than 3 million HCV-infected individuals in the U.S., who have let yet to be treated, approximately half of whom are diagnosed according to recent CDC data. 
Long-term education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis and the flow of HCV-infected patients into treated care are important and will play out over many years, as we know from our experience in HIV. 
Turning to Europe. Hepatitis C revenue was $846 million in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that more than 110,000 patients were treated with sofosbuvir-based regimens in 2015.
Following the normal summer seasonality in quarter 3, there was an increase of patient starts throughout Europe in quarter 4, including in the U.K. following the final appraisal determination for Harvoni from NICE. A number of countries in Europe have volume-based incentives of Sovaldi and Harvoni, which serve to encourage a high number of patients being treated. 
In quarter 4, the growth in revenues did not match the growth in patient starts because of the impact of certain volume-based agreements, combined with adverse foreign exchange movements. 
In Japan, hepatitis C revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion. Since the launch of Sovaldi in May and the launch of Harvoni in September, sales of $1.9 billion have been generated in Japan, with Harvoni representing more than $1 billion of that number. In late December, pricing and reimbursement negotiations for Sovaldi and Harvoni in Australia were finalized.
There were a number of variables to consider when thinking about HCV patient numbers and revenues for 2016. Patient starts in the U.S. will likely be similar to 2015 levels observed in the second half and extrapolated for the full year, while the Europe numbers will continue to grow as early launch markets stabilize and new markets ramp up treatment.
In Japan, patient numbers are difficult to predict because launches are still in the early stages, and to some extent, we are likely seeing the impact of warehoused patients. 
In the rest of the world, we're excited to bring -- to reach new patients in several new markets, notably in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. 
As we think about revenue, we anticipate that variables to consider include potential shorter durations of treatment, the full year effect of payer contracts in the U.S. and by price volume deals in some European markets, which may allow more patients to be treated at a lower per patient cost. 
We also anticipate that payer mix in the U.S. may shift slightly towards public payers, while in Japan, new legislation will likely result in lower pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni. 
We're confident in the long-term sustainability of HCV markets worldwide. Despite the number of patients treated to-date, there are still millions of HCV-infected individuals, who've yet to be treated and many other that have yet to be diagnosed. There are significant efforts underway by industry, governments and patient organizations to increase rates of diagnosis and linkage to care. 
We're also confident in our competitive position as we enter 2016. Sovaldi and Harvoni are breakthrough therapies that set the bar with cure rates of up to 99%. Data presented at AASLD in November showed real world cure rates with Harvoni that met or exceeded what was predicted by clinical trials, including the 8-week duration of therapy.  We also look forward to launching our next HCV product, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, in due course around the world starting later this year. 
Turning to HIV. HIV product revenue reached $3 billion in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., revenues were $2 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter and up 5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the continued demand for Stribild, Complera, Truvada and the recent launch of Genvoya. 
Stribild and Complera has a strong underlying prescription demand, with year-on-year growth of 40% and 12%, respectively. 
7 out of 10 HIV patients in the U.S. initiate therapy with a Gilead product, and nearly 6 in 10 receive a Gilead single-tablet regimen. 
Genvoya sales have been very encouraging in the first few weeks of launch. Revenues for the quarter were $44 million, with early product uptake well ahead of the launch of Stribild at the same time point. 
Access and reimbursement have been consistent with historical norms in HIV, and the rapid addition of Genvoya to the DHS gap treatment guidelines as a preferred first-line treatment reinforces the safety and efficacy profile observed in clinical trials and reflected in non-product label. 
In Europe, HIV revenues were $747 million for the quarter, up 4% from the third quarter, driven by the sales of Stribild and Eviplera, with a slight decline year-over-year caused by foreign exchange. 7 out of 10 patients in Europe also started on Truvada-based backbone in 2015. 
Genvoya was launched in Europe in November. Similar to the U.S., we have seen encouraging early product uptake in the 6 countries launched during the fourth quarter. 
A final comment on HIV is that the commercial organization is getting ready to execute the launches of R/F/TAF and F/TAF in the next months. 
Turning to other therapy areas. Total revenue for product outside of HIV and HCV, which includes Zydelig, AmBisome, Cayston, Letairis and Ranexa, totaled $1.9 billion in 2015 and grew 16% year-over-year. 
Over the last quarter, progress has been made in the area of cardiovascular disease. Since the inclusion of the AMBITION data in the Letairis label, we've seen a great deal of interest in engagement from  the medical community. 
Revenue for the full year for Letairis received -- reached $700 million, and market share for the products among patients initiating therapy is nearly 50%. 
In closing, Gilead had a remarkable 2015. The commercial organization's excited about the opportunities across all of Gilead's therapeutic areas, both in the near term and over the longer term, to help many more patients around the world. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Robin."

Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $12.61 per share for the year, up 56% year-over-year. 
Product sales during the year were $32.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year. HCV product sales increased year-over-year to $19.1 billion, up 54%. And non-HCV product sales increased year-over-year to $13 billion, up 8%. 
The increase in HCV product sales for the year was primarily driven by sales of Harvoni, which launched in October 2014. Further, the annualized HCV gross-to-net estimate that was shared with you during the Q4 earnings call a year ago is on target and reflected in our 2015 results. 
Non-HCV product sales growth for the year was primarily driven by Stribild and Complera, Eviplera partially offset by ATRIPLA.
Turning to expenses for the full year 2015. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.2 billion, up 17% compared to the prior year, driven by expenses to support our growth and geographic expansion. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year was 16.2%, which was lower compared to guidance due to the permanent extension of the federal R&D credit that was passed in December. If you recall, the permanent extension of the credit was not included in 2015 guidance. 
Cash flows from operations were $20.3 billion for the full year 2015 and $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter. 
With respect to shareholder return, $3.1 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase 29 million shares during the quarter, bringing total 2015 share repurchases to 10,095,000,000, shares. Including the Q2 2015 warrant settlement of $3.9 billion dividends and share repurchases, Gilead has returned more than $15 billion in cash to shareholders in 2015. 
Earlier today, we announced an increase of the quarterly dividend from $0.43 per share to $0.47 per share, which will become effective in the second quarter of 2016, subject to a declaration by the Board of Directors. 
Additionally, the board authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program to be initiated after the completion of the current $15 billion program, which, as of December 31, 2015, had $8 billion remaining. 
Also announced was the utilization of $5 billion of the current program to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, which is expected to be completed in the next 3 months. This is in addition to the ongoing open market share repurchases that have continued under the current share repurchase bulk program since January of this year. 
The increase in the dividend and increased level of share repurchases underscore the confidence of the board and management in the strength of the business and future cash flows. 
Since 2010, in addition to financing ongoing R&D programs and business development activities, more than 75% of free cash flows were returned to shareholders, and share count was reduced in excess of 20% while maintaining and improving investment-grade credit ratings, which Gilead values. 
Looking forward, the plan is to continue to return a significant component of free cash flows to shareholders via share repurchases and increases to our dividend over time. 
As in the past, there could be future periods of time when share repurchases are reduced due to acquisitions and other pipeline investments that are prioritized to drive future long-term growth. This strategy provides agility and financial flexibility to support R&D investments as well as any future acquisitions or partnership opportunities we may consider. 
Finally, I would like to cover full year 2016 non-GAAP financial guidance summarized on Slide 51 in the earnings presentation available on the Gilead website. 
Product sales are expected to be in the range of $30 billion to $31 billion. Guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patients start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 88% to 90%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion as a result of the continued investment in our product pipeline. This includes the financial impact of the Galapagos calibration, or collaboration, which closed in January. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. This reflects an estimated $200 million increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee. Please note that 2015 included a favorable adjustment of approximately $100 million based on the receipt of the 2015 invoice from the IRS. 
For the full year, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This includes the impact of the federal R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015, and the increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee, which is not tax-deductible. 
Full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.16 per share. 
In closing, we are pleased with 2015 accomplishments across the organization. Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.

So I think I said in the script that we should anticipate in the United States that 2016 revenues should be more or less based on the second half of 2015 extrapolated for the year. I also mentioned that we had some lumpiness in the second half of the year due to the purchasing profile of the VA. And we anticipate that, that will smooth out during the course of this year. I've also said numerous times before that in quarter 1 last year, we had a very large bulbous of warehouse patients being treated which, of course, we're unlikely to see again. But to some extent, that gets substituted as the payers, commercial payers, that we are well-known are beginning to loosen restrictions. So there's a few dynamics in the U.S., but I think the way that I would look at it is a fairly flat stable, perhaps marginally growing a number of patients flowing into treatment. If we see public payers stepping up like Medicaid and perhaps a correctional facility to start treating more patients, then patient numbers could go higher than that in 2016. There's a few other factors, which I also mentioned, as we think about the revenue aspect as opposed to just patient numbers. The less-sick patients, GT1 patients that qualify, are more likely to be using the 8-week Harvoni treatment duration. And of course, therefore, revenue per patient would come down proportionately. Having said that, the offset is that budgets for treating patients go up, and we would like to think that more patients could be treated. So I think that's sort of the main thing. I think from a competitive point of view, we feel very confident that our label is very strong and that we are very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni and with very high SVR rates and a very strong safety profile, at least as good, if not better, than the one that was used in our registrational trials. So I think we feel good about the year. The U.S. is fairly steady and possibly could even grow, as I said, if some restrictions loosens and public payers step up. Around the world, as I mentioned, we expect patient numbers to grow in Europe. They started to stabilize in the major markets now, again, following more or less the shape of the curve in the U.S., where there is a large lump because of warehoused patients being treated initially. That is smoothing out now. And many of the smaller markets are now beginning to come on onstream. And so we should see higher number of patients in Europe. But the same thing, we're likely to see more patients being treated with shorter durations. And as I also mentioned, we do have a number of price volume agreements in place, which are delivered incentive wise to encourage high volumes of patients being treated but at a lower revenue per patient, if you like. So we should think about that. And then around the rest of the world, Japan, I mentioned, very early days. We're still in that warehousing phase, I think, in Japan, although we're very pleased with the launch there so far. And then there were various other small markets around the world and medium-size markets, Canada, Australia being one of the medium-sized markets that are yet to launch yet. So we have plenty of patients around the world, but there are some other dynamics, as I said, around shorter treatment and, of course, the competitive situation."

We have -- we faced an extraordinary time when we've been able to triple revenue over the last couple of years, which is a very unusual thing for an organization to be able to do. And we're moving our pipeline along as fast as we can. And as we mentioned, there's some very interesting opportunities for us. So we do see very good opportunities in organic growth. And I have great confidence in HIV portfolio that with the 3 STRs we talked about on the call today and the other STR being developed by our partner, Johnson, that will have very -- a meaningful continued growth of both patients and revenues in the future in HIV. I think that's a very important thing for us. We're continuing to accelerate HCV to bring SOF/Velpatasvir to market and try to work in more countries than we ever have before. So those are important initiatives and things that are current to market. We're very excited about filgotinib. I think there's great opportunities for us in inflammatory diseases. We hadn't spoken about it very much in the past, and sort of quietly, we've been investigating our MMP-9 antibody, 5745, which we didn't talk about on this call, which now has positive data in 3 of the 4 indications we've looked at in inflammatory diseases, with the fourth under investigation. And so not only do we have filgotinib potentially for RA and inflammatory diseases, but we have an antibody, which has a mechanism, which is very refractory to current care and could be a very good beginning to a inflammatory disease franchise. Of course, you mentioned the kinase inhibitors that we have for oncology. There's always a potential that those could be useful in various diseases in combination with filgotinib as well, and we will explore that, although I still think the best value of it is the fact that it's a very good-looking drug and some very positive data in Crohn's disease. So we are going down the pathway of inflammatory diseases by virtue of the successes we've had in our pipeline and successes in licensing. In oncology, it's -- Zydelig has been a good start for us. We really need to continue to try to ramp up our efforts in this area and to continue to broaden the areas we want to work in. It's pretty clear we have to do additional partnerships or find other avenues to broaden the revenue stream there for the future. As Robin mentioned, with our balance sheet, we have to create flexibility of the new partnerships or acquisitions that could get us there, and so that would be an important consideration for us. That may not be the only avenue. We also look at other areas where we can bring in different programs, potentially accelerating the revenue as soon as possible in some of those areas when those things are available. And as the environment has shifted dramatically in our favor, we're doing those sorts of partnerships and whatnot. So that's a good -- 2016, I believe, will be a good year for us because of the strengths of the underlying business and the economic uncertainty that's driving the market today."

I mean, I think if we tossed our minds back 12 months, we had the first competitor coming in to the hepatitis C space. And I think the managed care view at that time was that these products were interchangeable and could be treated by commodities, to some extent, which really triggered off the pricing and negotiations we saw in early part of last year. That has been proven to be a totally incorrect view of the hepatitis C products. And what we've seen, fortunately, with Harvoni, in particular, is the real-world data has really strengthened its position and people's understanding of what that product does. It has -- it cures people with an incredibly high SVR rate, and the safety profile has been extremely good and in line, if not better, than its label. That hasn't been the case of competitor products so far. In fact, we've seen safety warnings added to labels, and we've seen a differentiation. And that's played out in the market. So I think as we see a new competitor coming into the market, now payers are really thinking this through. There isn't any kind of sort of instinctive reactions. People have been very thoughtful, and we noticed because we have very close discussions with the managed care main players. And we're working with them as they think through this.

And that really was the peak of this warehoused patient part of the curve, then dropped down into quarter 2 of 65,000. There were still some of those warehoused patients coming through. And in quarter 3 was 62,000, and quarter 4 was 50,000. We know that in quarter 3, a lot of patients were treated by the VA who, by the way, seems to be incredibly efficient at getting patients into treatment. And we know that in quarter 4, very few patients were initiated by the VA. So I think if you do the basic math on that, you would get up to about 230-something-thousand forecasting that forward into 2016 if you assume that VA picks up. Then I think this sort of merges into the second part of your question, which is what happens with Medicaid and other public payers who, to date, have really treated very, very few people. So our assumption is they're still not going to treat that many more patients this year, is the way we're thinking forward. But we are hopeful that, that will be a trend that improves over time as people start to see how effective these drugs are and, particularly, 8-week usage of Harvoni which, as I mentioned, in the real world, it seems to be incredibly effective and offers very good value. So that's how we're thinking about it. I hope that's clear."

I know it's hard for everyone to get their hands around, but you indicated again there are about 3 million HCV patients in the U.S. that have yet to be treated. About half of those are diagnosed. In terms of new patients that are entering the system, how similar or different are they from the existing patients or those that have already been cured in terms of, I guess, the overall motivation to be treated, fibrosis score insurance coverage. We get a lot of questions on are these future patients actually legitimate candidates in terms of being under the care of a doc, not IV drug users, et cetera. So can you just comment, try to give us a little bit more comfort in how we can be thinking about this longer-term evolution in the U.S.?"

And that number has been remarkably consistent at around -- we have actually 3 different sources of data, and it's around high 20,000s to 30,000 patients a month have been falling into that category. So they're diagnosed with HCV, and they're registered with a treater. So if you do the math on that, clearly, that's 360,000 patients coming into treatment a year, and we're seeing treatment levels are lower than that. And what that speaks to is the types of patients are different amongst that 360,000 group, and their sort of pathway to actual treatment varies considerably. But it does appear, again, doing the math and assuming the research is correct, that there is a line at the door of patients that still need to be treated and are accessible. I don't think those are the people that are, let's say, out of society or -- these are people that are accessible and for one reason or another reason, they haven't started treatment yet. But there's a strong flow of patients still out there, and I don't think we're anywhere near getting to the point where we're dealing with patients that are extremely difficult, let's say, to manage."

But for the company to grow, we have to work in other areas. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to work at hepatitis B, which is important to us, and there is the potential to cure that disease. We all recognize that as a hard thing to do as well as curing HIV, which is an equally or harder thing to do, perhaps. So that does imply that we have to go outside of antivirals for continued growth, and we're interested in doing that as we've been hiring and growing with new things in our portfolio over a number of years. I think we have some good core teams that can help us grow into those areas. And so the answer is yes, we're very interested in acquiring assets through partnerships or potentially acquisitions that could help us grow in those areas. And with the tripling of our revenue over the last few years, the need to do so sooner rather than later is hyped. That being said, we want to get the right assets at the right price. And so we have the flexibilities certainly with our balance sheet in that current business to be patient to get things to not be forced into doing something before we want to. And so we are looking in the area of oncology. We are looking at additional things in inflammatory diseases, things that are adjacent to there, to see what opportunities might fit within our portfolio so that we could create a really strong franchise like we have in HIV and HCV with multiple options for success in those areas. Some of it will depend on what happens in our portfolio this year as we make progress with our MMP-9 antibody or not. Obviously, we're looking heavily at NASH with the FXR agonists. We're very interested in liver diseases, so that's a very important area for us. And we'll continue to try to bolster those to make sure that the company has the assets necessary to have the progress for the future. Is there a shopping list? There's always a list that you have in your mind or sometimes on paper. That's probably dangerous. So mine's in my mind with which I think about things that would be important for us or things that could have the right opportunity at the right price. Whether or not those things ever come to fruition depends on a lot of factors. But clearly, we're going to be very interested in taking a look this year."

But it is category of patient as more patients are being diagnosed and working their way through the system.

If you look at some of the ACR20 responses, they are up to 80%, but ACR70s are only in the teens or 20% at most. So that means there's a huge improvement left to be done, and that, we believe, could be done with combination therapies. We're going to go ahead and combine our JAK inhibitor with our MMP-9.

So I think that's my main point. We anticipate higher numbers of patients in 2016 over '15. And countries like the U.K. really didn't treat very many patients at all so far, but they are now beginning to ramp up. And then, some of the smaller countries, Netherlands, Austria, are beginning to grow patient numbers. Having said that, I also mentioned earlier price volume agreements. These are set up to try and encourage more patients being treated. But obviously, the flipside to those arrangements is that the price per patient comes down, and there's better value to treat more patients. The other thing, I think, it's the real-world data with 8 weeks of Harvoni treatment. It looks stronger and stronger and is more convincing to European payers. And therefore, they will also use that opportunity to try and treat more patients, but of course, at a lower revenue per patient."

While we want to keep our remarks relatively brief to allow plenty of time for your questions, I do want to make a few comments about the first 2 months of 2016 and what I see as the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Gilead's HIV franchise is off to a great start with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of [indiscernible], which followed the approval of Genvoya late last year. Over the last 6 months, I've had the opportunity talk with physicians and patients about the importance of having highly effective and safer options, especially for patients facing a lifetime of therapy. 
With the approval of our 3 new regimens, we are now able to offer a range of options to address the diverse medical requirements of people with HIV, including those new to treatment, those who have been on therapy for a long time and have run short of options and those who desire to switch medications for a variety of reasons. 
Since 2001, Gilead therapies have played a transformative role in changing HIV infection from a fatal and debilitating disease into a chronic and manageable condition. That's true around the world, as broader access to HIV treatment has helped divert millions of AIDS deaths. 
Innovation remains important in the continuing fighting of HIV, and we're proud that [indiscernible] is the first new backbone approved by the FDA in more than a decade. 
Gilead continues the commitment to helping HIV patients around the globe with our research and development activities, including novel agents for daily treatment, long-acting regimens and HIV cure. 
In liver disease, we just wrapped up an exciting week in Barcelona at the International Liver Conference, or ISL, as it's known. It was a remarkable meeting, especially considering the significant change in the HCV treatment landscape since the conference was held last in Spain 4 years ago. The outlook for patients has completely changed, with dramatic improvements in cure rates for a wider range of patients. 
Presentations at ISL included results from several Phase II and Phase III studies evaluating sofosbuvir plus GS-9857. These are 2 investigational paginated fixed-dose combination therapies for the treatment of HCV. 
The data presented continues to underscore the high cure rates and safety of our sofosbuvir-based therapies and support their utility across all HCV patients genotypes in a wide range of disease stages. 
Data were also presented on the use of TAF for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 48-week results from 2 Phase III studies demonstrated potential to advance the treatment of HCV, operating a similar efficacy profile to Viread improved bone and renal safety parameters. 
Based on these results, we submitted a new drug application for TAF, and FDA has set a PDUFA date of November 11. 
We also submitted a regulatory applications for TAF in the European Union and Japan last quarter. 
I'm particularly encouraged by the work that's going on in NASH, which we've augmented with our agreement to acquire the Nimbus [indiscernible], or ACC program, as was announced last month. NASH expect 15 million people in the U.S. as expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020. Including the ACC program, Gilead has 4 investigational compounds that target unique disease pathways, including production of lipids, inflammation and fibrosis from each of which are thought to contribute to or cause NASH. Data in ISL were percent at supporting the development of Gilead's investigational agents for the treatment of NASH, including simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that is selected for [indiscernible] 2, which is also being evaluated primarily sclerosing cholangitis, GS-4997 and S1 inhibitor and GS-9674 and FXR agonist. Members also presented positive Phase I data for the programs lead candidate, NDI-010976, which targets ACC, the key step in the bread biosynthesis pathway. 
Overall, I'm enthusiastic about the future of Gilead and excited to have the opportunity to help building the company's long history of success. Over the past few months, I've had conversations with external stakeholders and employees across all parts of our organization. It's gratifying to see the extent to which Gilead products and commitment to access have uniquely changed the course of diseases for so many people throughout the world. We now have the opportunity to do so again in many new areas. 
A few things to [indiscernible] in those conversations. First, positions in patients share the excitement that our medical and commercial teams have regarding Gilead's new treatment options for HCV and HIV, particularly the new TAF-based therapies. Access continues to improve for people with HCV around the world, and in fact, we have treated close to 1 million patients with sofosbuvir-based regimens Sovaldi was first approved in late 2013. That's a remarkable achievement in just over 2 years. 
With regards to HIV, as many of you are aware, TAF was added to the Medicines Patent Pool and to our various Access Program. The clinical data just TAF-based regimens may be the best option in both the developed and developing world. We will build on success we've had with the TDF-regimens, now used by nearly 10 million people every single day, to make TAF regimens accessible around the world, providing much-needed new options. 
Secondly, I believe we have a rich pipeline, creating opportunities that may allow the transformation of the treatment of many diseases like NASH, HPV and defamatory diseases, certain cancers and cardiovascular conditions, for which few, if any options exist. 
We are committed to building on our company's long history of success, and I'm confident that our innovation and hard work will deliver on our shared goal of delivering new treatments and providing broad access to Gilead's medicines for patients in need. 
Finally, we continue to look for business development opportunities that add to our court year. Areas in our fitted with Gilead's expertise and capabilities. We are actively assessing options and will make most when the right opportunities present themselves. 
I will now turn the call over to Robin, who will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Robin will be followed by Paul, who will provide additional color on the company's performance across product and geographies."

We are pleased to report on first quarter results, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion,",926,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report on first quarter results, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. 
Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. Product sales for the quarter were $7.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. 
Starting with HIV and other antivirals. Product sales for the first quarter increased to $2.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased sales in the U.S. 
We continue to see strong uptake of our newer single-tablet regimens, including Genvoya, which was launched in November 2015. Additionally, year-over-year, Stribild and Complera grew 34% and 19%, respectively. 
Sequentially, T-cells decreased 4%, primarily driven by sub-wholesaler inventory decreases in the U.S., reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from quarter 4 to quarter 1. HCV product sales for the first quarter decreased 6% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, primarily driven by a decrease in Harvoni sales in the U.S., which was partially offset by the launch of our HCV products in Japan and other international markets. 
In the U.S., the year-over-year Harvoni sales decline was driven by lower patient starts and the full-quarter impact of higher commercial rebates, which were entered into during the first quarter of 2015. 
Sequentially, HCV product sales decreased 12%, primarily driven by revenue declines in the U.S. and Japan. In the U.S., the decline was due to the increase in discounts required to open up access to patients with lower fibrosis scores and a modest shift in payer mix toward more deeply discounted government payer segments. 
In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher-than-expected prior quarter rebate claims. Rebate claims come in 1 to 2 quarters in arrears and were updated in Q1 to reflect the higher claims received. 
In Japan, SOVALDI volumes declined from high early-launch levels, similar to other markets, and channel inventory pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni was adjusted during March for the mandatory price reduction effective as of April 1. 
Turning to our other therapeutic areas. Product sales of cardiovascular, respiratory and other were $498 million, up 19% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. 
Moving to gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 90.9% for the same period last year. The decrease reflects a $200 million charge or $0.12 earnings per share related to the jury verdict in the Merck trial in March. Although the proceedings in the Merck trial are not complete and the losing party will appeal once the court enters judgment, we booked the charge to comply with accounting rules related to contingencies. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses was $769 million for the first quarter, up 18% compared to the same period last year, due to the continued progression of clinical studies, particularly in liver disease and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $638 million for the first quarter, up 6% compared to the same period last year. These expenses increased primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of Gilead's business and were offset by favorable adjustments related to the Branded Prescription Drug beat of $191 million, following the receipt of the preliminary 2016 IRS invoice. 
From a balance sheet perspective, during the first quarter, we generated cash flows from operations of $3.9 billion and ended the quarter with $21.3 billion in cash and investments. 
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per share for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. 
$8 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase shares of our common stock during the quarter, consisting of $3 billion of open-market repurchases or 33.4 million shares, and $5 billion under the accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, that we announced in February. 46.1 million shares were repurchased under this program during the quarter. 
The final settlement of the ASR program was completed earlier this month, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares. 
In total, 54.3 million shares were retired under the ASR program at an average price of $92.09 per share. 
As of March 31, the amount of capital returned to shareholders, consisting of dividends and share repurchases, exceeded the total amount of capital returned during the first 3 quarters of 2015 combined. 
During the quarter, we completed a $15 billion share repurchase program approved byour board in January 2015 and, as of April 1, have begun repurchasing shares under our $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program approved in January of this year. 
Since 2012, we've repurchased over 260 million shares or 17% of shares outstanding. 
Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance provided to you on February 2 and summarized on Slide 25 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. 
As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patients start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul to provide more details in our commercial results for the quarter."

Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens. We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya, both",1498,"Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. 
I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens. We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya, both in the U.S. and in the European markets, where we've achieved reimbursement. 
Starting with the U.S. Through 5 months post the launch of Genvoya, cumulative prescriptions were twofold more than any HIV product from any company since ATRIPLA, which was the first single-tablet regimen to come to market back in 2006. As expected, most of Genvoya's initial perceptions came from switches. Qualitative feedback from HIV prescribers is very encouraging indicating a clear intent to switch patients at the earliest opportunity. 
Stribild and Complera showed strong year-over-year prescription growth at 18% and 5%, respectively, and in quarter 4 2015, Stribild was the leading product in the U.S. for patients naïve to treatment. With the launches of Genvoya and now, just very recently, [indiscernible], we expect switches out of TDF-based single-tablet regimens into the TAF regimens to grow significantly. 
In fact, 82% of Genvoya's prescriptions have been switches. 49% of the switches have come from Stribild. 
We are seeing an improvement in our ability to retain switch patients, meaning fewer patients who switch from Gilead TDF-containing regimens move to non-Gilead products. Of all the patients who switched to Genvoya, 91% came from a Gilead regimen, and 9% came from a non-Gilead product. 
In addition to such as, preliminary quarter 1 2016 data indicate to us that Genvoya may soon be among the most prescribed products of patients new to treatment. 
Historically, in quarter 1, we've seen a decrease in sub-wholesaler inventories following a buildup in the prior quarter. We observed that's a fact again this year, leading to a sequential decrease in HIV product sales. 
Finally, in the U.S., I'd like to highlight the growing use of Truvada [indiscernible], which was more than 20% of Truvada demand last quarter and drove a 17% year-on-year growth in prescriptions. 
Turning to Europe. We're also pleased with the way that our HIV business is performing, with successful reimbursement and launches of Genvoya in several countries, including Germany and the Nordics. In other countries, Stribild and Eviplera continue to replace ATRIPLA. Stribild remains the most prescribed regimen for patients naïve to treatment in the EU, with Eviplera in third place. 
Genvoya was launched in Germany during quarter 1, and at the end of the quarter, preliminary data indicated it had the leading market share for both naïve and switch patients. 
The product was launched and fully reimbursed and Spain just 2 weeks ago. And we're very excited about the opportunities to offer providers another important option to address the needs of their patients. 
It's also been recognized as a preferred regimen in numerous country guidelines, including Germany, Spain and Italy, even before reimbursement has been agreed. This is testament to the favorable clinical profile of Genvoya, a single-tablet regimen that best addresses the needs of patients who require long-term chronic therapy. We're working hard to negotiate timely reimbursement across the rest of the European markets. 
Finally, in HIV, we launched [indiscernible] this month in the U.S. and the EU. We see this launch as a milestone in HIV treatment, as [indiscernible] is the first new NRTI backbone since Truvada 10 years ago. Given the very high use of Truvada as a preferred back bone third multiple third agents, including TVK, we're confident that [indiscernible] will quickly replaced Truvada and become the leading HIV regimen backbone in all our markets. 
Now moving to hepatitis C. We continue to see revenue dynamics around the world, which vary by country. As Robin noted, our overall HCV product revenue decreased 6% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. 
I'll now describe the different dynamics by geographic region. Starting with the U.S. market. We've seen an increase of new patients in the first quarter, offset by lower revenue per patient due to several factors that include an increase in our gross-to-net adjustments as well as the shortening average duration of therapy. 
Total market patient starts increased around 10% over Q4 to an estimated 55,000 in Q1. This was primarily driven by the continued opening of access across payer segments to allow for the treatment of patients with low fibrosis scores as well as an increase in treatment by the VA during the second half of the quarter, as funding made its way to the various VA site. The revenue associated with this increase in patient starts was partially offset by an increase in discounts associated with our contract agreements entered into during the first quarter of 2015, which provides for additional discounts the practices provide to a broader patient population. We also saw a gradual shift to more deeply discounted payer segments such as VA, PHS and Medicaid compared to the prior quarter. 
In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher-than-expected prior quarter rebate claim, which come in 1 to 2 quarters in arrears and were updated in quarter 1 to reflect the higher claims received. The average duration of therapy has shortened, as fewer patients require 24 weeks of treatment, and a higher proportion of genotype 1 patients are treated for 8 weeks, resulting in slightly lower revenues for patients. 
The ability to treat for 8 weeks notably has a strong competitive differentiation. In fact, our market share remains strong, with more than 90% of all patients treated in the quarter being prescribed by the Harvoni or Sovaldi. Qualitative feedback suggests that prescribing HCV physicians are encouraged by the fact that real-world outcomes mimic the experience in clinical trials. 
Several presentations of real-world data at easel reinforce what has been seen in clinical practice. 
As we think about the rest of the year in the U.S., patient slow peaked in quarter 1 2015 then declined in quarter 2 and stabilized in quarter 3 and quarter 4 of 2015. In quarter 1 of 2016, there was an uptick in new patient starts. Our data show that 25,000 to 30,000 patients a month are entering treated care, which exceeds the number of patients starting therapy on a monthly basis. That means there are many more people who could benefit from treatment who are already linked to care. We expect new patient starts to remain consistent through the rest of 2016. 
Despite the number of patients treated today, they are still over 3,000 -- 3 million, I'm sorry, patients in the U.S. who have yet to be treated. About half of these patients are undiagnosed. Education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis are important. And as we well know from public health efforts in the HIV area, these efforts playout over many years. We're encouraged to see data that screening and diagnosis rates have increased at least twofold over the last 5 years. 
Now turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in Europe was down 13% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially, while overall Gilead patient starts increased 5% sequentially to around 31,000 in the quarter. Average revenue per patient declined due to a shift in geographic mix and shorter average treatment durations. We also saw a negative foreign exchange movement, which affected HCV revenues by about 8% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. 
The mix of sales in the EU is such that more patients and are now being treated in countries who have lowered at prices for patients. European countries continue to vary significantly in terms of patient access, with many still limiting treatment to patients with high fibrosis scores. We anticipate that as sicker patients are treated, these restrictions will start to loosen, as healthier patients can be cared for within existing budgets. Again, as in the U.S., we treat just a small fraction of patients diagnosed. We're encouraged by ongoing efforts and commitments by governments to increase diagnosis and treatments across Europe. 
Now moving to Japan. Revenue was over $1 billion during the quarter. We're pleased with the successful launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni, where a strong patient flow and higher market shares continued through quarter 1. More than 30,000 patients were treated with Gilead products during the quarter, representing a market share greater than 90%. 
Other markets, where we recently launched our HCV products, include Australia, where nearly 5,000 patients started treatment in Q1. This reflects a commitment by the Australian government to address their HCV burden and the usual warehousing of patients prior to the launch of sofosbuvir-based regimens. 
In closing, our underlying HCV business is strong and sustainable. We've treated around 700,000 patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan. And despite strong competition, Gilead has maintained high market shares in all regions. 
The Gilead commercial organization is focused on executing our numerous HIV and HCV product launches across multiple geographies during the remainder of the year. 
In addition to our 3 TAF-based HIV products, we're preparing to launch our pan-genotypic HCV product as early as next quarter in the U.S.

So several things happened in the quarter with -- in relation to volume and revenue per patient. So maybe I'll try and deal with all of them. So the first thing, as you've said, we had -- and we expected this and hoped for it, that several of the large commercial payers opened up access to patients regardless of their fibrosis scores during quarter 1. The consequence of that was that they triggered a discount that had been previously negotiated in order to incentivize that opening up of restrictions. So that was the first thing. And then the VA, as you know, treated very few patients in quarter 4 last year because of lack of funding. That funding was agreed for a 2-year period and focused on HCV medicines and was clarified late December. Than the VA went through a process of evaluating the clinical valuation of products available from not just us but, obviously, new entrants to the market. And that process took through till mid to late January. And we have to negotiate with the VA, and we did give the VA some extra discount, which resulted them in putting our products on their formulary and also opening up, again, access to all patients within the VA. So there are no restrictions on patients. And again, we see this as a large positive. And as those funding got distributed around the VA centers, we started seeing a very large uptick in VA treatment from about the middle of the quarter. And we anticipate that, that will continue through the year. The second kind of area [indiscernible] of course, we have the entrance of Merck into the market. And so we judiciously exercised our contractual right to preserve access. And in a few cases, we did increase a little bit of discount to some payer to ensure that Harvoni, in particular, remained on formularies and with full access. The third thing, I think, we've seen, as I indicated in the comments, was a slight and gradual shift of payer mix away from the commercial and Medicare Part D payers towards the more government payers. And that was probably about a 10% shift from quarter 4 to quarter 1. And then the final piece, as we indicated, we did have a catch-up, a true-up of some rebate claims that came in respect of quarter 3 and quarter 4, that were able bit higher than the estimated last quarter and which we put right during quarter 1. So that really is the dynamic between volumes and revenue per patient."

And with the fibrosis restrictions being dropped now, most physicians can treat certainly in the commercial area and Medicare area, can treat whoever they want. One thing's clear, though, that there are still prior authorizations in place, and there's still a fair amount of office paperwork and bureaucracy that have to be put in place for each patient. Then as the patients themselves, many of whom just simply are quite mentally ready or psychologically ready to commit to their disciplined 8-week or 12-week treatment. And with these products, of course, if insurance comes on, do it twice, they want to try to get it right first time. The doctors want to get it right first [ph] time.

So the first question was about patient volumes coming in and relative to the opening up of the fibrosis scores. So I'm not sure whether you looked at data or not, but we get new to brand base, which is really the leading indicator of new starts in the quarter. So we've seen, and this is just retail scripts, by the way, so that doesn't include the VA. It doesn't include scripts that go through ESI and various other groups. So it's partly representative. And what we've seen amongst those scripts is new starts in the quarter have gone up, and and that's going to be exactly in line with our expectations with the fibrosis scores being relieved. Total scripts are relatively flat, and part of that is because in quarter 4, of course, the patient numbers, throughout really 2015 quarter-on-quarter, the new starts were coming down. And therefore, the refills associated with those new starts falling into quarter 1 was somewhat down. So aggregate of the next the numbers total prescriptions in the quarter look relatively flat and slightly disengaged from the fibrosis piece. So I think that hopefully covers that. And then, of course, the VA, isn't included in that group, and that was a large number of patients coming in to the system."

What we do know, there's plenty of plenty of patients out there. As I said, odd days, we work 3 different sources of data, which shows that 25,000 to 30,000 patients are coming at the treatment.

And also, from the patient side and people actually ready to be treated. I think they want to be teed up, they like the treatment, but they might not want to actually starve some more in the morning. So I think we should expect patient flow to be fairly stable through this year. And then on the negotiations side, I mean, I think, with real-world data, payers are tending now to really take a lot more time and put a lot more thought into evaluating the clinical profiles of the products. And until we see the clinical profiles of the new products, it's very hard to predict how competitive they are. I mean, if they're competitive, I think we have to anticipate prices will come down or negotiate because we certainly don't want to lose any access to patients around products. And we'll defend our market share vigorously. So it's hard to predict. I think, directionally, competition equals lower prices. But we're going to be focusing on looking at differentiating our products. We've got great products out there now, and our pipeline looks really exciting.

And I think once we have shown that we are pretty high confidence that there would be meaningful clinical benefit of the compound."

Gilead's HIV franchise is off to a great start with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Odefsey and Descovy, which followed the approval of Genvoya late last year. Over the last 6 months, I've had the opportunity talk with physicians and patients about the importance of having highly effective and safer options, especially for patients facing a lifetime of therapy.
With the approval of our 3 new regimens, we are now able to offer a range of options to address the diverse medical requirements of people with HIV, including those new to treatment, those who've been on therapy for a long time and have run short of options and those who desire to switch medications for a variety of reasons.
Since 2001, Gilead therapies have played a transformative role in changing HIV infection from a fatal and debilitating disease into a chronic and manageable condition. That's true around the world, as broader access to HIV treatment has helped divert millions of AIDS deaths.
Innovation remains important in the continuing fighting of HIV, and we're proud that Descovy is the first new backbone approved by the FDA in more than a decade.
Gilead continues the commitment to helping HIV patients around the globe with our research and development activities, including novel agents for daily treatment, long-acting regimens and HIV cure.
In liver disease, we just wrapped up an exciting week in Barcelona at the International Liver Conference (sic) [ International Liver Congress
], or EASL, as it's known. It was a remarkable meeting, especially considering the significant change in the HCV treatment landscape since the conference was held last in Spain 4 years ago. The outlook for patients has completely changed with dramatic improvements in cure rates for a wider range of patients.
Presentations at EASL included results from several Phase II and Phase III studies evaluating sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir plus GS-9857. These are 2 investigational pan-genotypic fixed-dose combination therapies for the treatment of HCV.
The data presented continues to underscore the high cure rates and safety of our sofosbuvir-based therapies and support their utility across all HCV patient genotypes in a wide range of disease stages.
Data were also presented on the use of TAF for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 48-week results from 2 Phase III studies demonstrated potential to advance the treatment of HCV, offering a similar efficacy profile to Viread with improved bone and renal safety parameters. Based on these results, we submitted a new drug application for TAF, and FDA has set a PDUFA date of November 11.
We also submitted regulatory applications for TAF in the European Union and Japan last quarter.
I'm particularly encouraged by the work that's going on in NASH, which we've augmented with our agreement to acquire the Nimbus Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, or ACC, program, as was announced last month. NASH affects up to 15 million people in the U.S. and is expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020.
Including the ACC program, Gilead has 4 investigational compounds that target unique disease pathways, including production of lipids, inflammation and fibrosis, each of which are thought to contribute to or cause NASH. Data in EASL represented support in the development of Gilead's investigational agents for the treatment of NASH, including simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that is selected for LOXL2, which is also being evaluated to primary sclerosing cholangitis; GS-4997, an ASK1 inhibitor; and GS-9674, an FXR agonist. Nimbus also presented positive Phase I data for the program's lead candidate, NDI-010976, which targets ACC, the key step in the lipid biosynthesis pathway.
Overall, I'm enthusiastic about the future of Gilead and excited to have the opportunity to help build in the company's long history of success. Over the past few months, I've had conversations with external stakeholders and employees across all parts of our organization. It's gratifying to see the extent to which Gilead's products and commitment to access have uniquely changed the course of diseases for so many people throughout the world. We now have the opportunity to do so again in many new areas.
A few things to note in those conversation. First, physicians and patients share the excitement that our medical and commercial teams have regarding Gilead's new treatment options for HCV and HIV, particularly the new TAF-based therapies. Access continues to improve for people with HCV around the world, and in fact, we have treated close to 1 million patients with sofosbuvir-based regimens since Sovaldi was first approved in late 2013. That's a remarkable achievement in just over 2 years.
With regards to HIV, as many of you are aware, TAF was added to the Medicines Patent Pool and to our various Access Programs. The clinical data suggest TAF-based regimens may be the best option in both the developed and developing world. We will build on success we've had with the TDF-regimens, now used by nearly 10 million people every single day, to make TAF regimens accessible around the world, providing much-needed new options.
Secondly, I believe we have a rich pipeline, creating opportunities that may allow the transformation of the treatment of many diseases like NASH, HPV inflammatory diseases, certain cancers and cardiovascular conditions, for which few, if any, options exist.
We are committed to building on our company's long history of success, and I'm confident that our innovation and hard work will deliver on our shared goal of delivering new treatments and providing broad access to Gilead's medicines for patients in need.
Finally, we continue to look for business development opportunities that add to our core therapeutic areas and are a fit with Gilead's expertise and capabilities. We are actively assessing options and we'll make moves when the right opportunities present themselves.
I will now turn the call over to Robin who'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Robin will be followed by Paul who'll provide additional color on the company's performance across products and geographies."

We are pleased to report our first quarter results with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, u",930,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report our first quarter results with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. Product sales for the quarter were $7.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially.
Starting with HIV and other antivirals. Product sales for the first quarter increased to $2.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased sales in the U.S.
We continue to see strong uptake of our newer single-tablet regimens, including Genvoya, which was launched in November 2015. Additionally, year-over-year, Stribild and Complera grew 34% and 19%, respectively.
Sequentially, these sales decreased 4% primarily driven by sub-wholesaler inventory decreases in the U.S., reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from quarter 4 to quarter 1.
HCV product sales for the first quarter decreased 6% year-over-year to $4.3 billion primarily driven by a decrease in Harvoni sales in the U.S., which was partially offset by the launch of our HCV products in Japan and other international markets.
In the U.S., the year-over-year Harvoni sales decline was driven by lower patient starts and a full-quarter impact of higher commercial rebates, which were entered into during the first quarter of 2015.
Sequentially, HCV product sales decreased 12% primarily driven by revenue declines in the U.S. and Japan. In the U.S., the decline was due to the increase in discounts required to open up access to patients with lower fibrosis scores and a modest shift in payer mix towards more deeply discounted government payer segments.
In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher-than-expected prior quarter rebate claims. Rebate claims come in 1 to 2 quarters in arrears and were updated in Q1 to reflect the higher claims received.
In Japan, Sovaldi volumes declined from high early-launch levels, similar to other markets, and channel inventory pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni was adjusted during March for the mandatory price reduction effective as of April 1.
Turning to our other therapeutic areas. Product sales of cardiovascular, respiratory and other were $498 million, up 19% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially.
Moving to gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 90.9% for the same period last year. The decrease reflects a $200 million charge or $0.12 earnings per share related to the jury verdict in the Merck trial in March. Although the proceedings in the Merck trial are not complete and the losing party will appeal once the court enters judgment, we booked the charge to comply with accounting rules related to contingencies.
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense -- expenses were $769 million for the first quarter, up 18% compared to the same period last year, due to the continued progression of clinical studies, particularly in liver disease and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $638 million for the first quarter, up 6% compared to the same period last year. These expenses increased primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of Gilead's business and were offset by favorable adjustments related to the Branded Prescription Drug fee of $191 million, following the receipt of the preliminary 2016 IRS invoice.
From a balance sheet perspective, during the first quarter, we generated cash flows from operations of $3.9 billion and ended the quarter with $21.3 billion in cash and investments.
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per share for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. $8 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase shares of our common stock during the quarter, consisting of $3 billion of open-market repurchases or 33.4 million shares, and $5 billion under the accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, that we announced in February. 46.1 million shares were repurchased under this program during the quarter. The final settlement of the ASR program was completed earlier this month, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares. In total, 54.3 million shares were retired under the ASR program at an average price of $92.09 per share.
As of March 31, the amount of capital returned to shareholders, consisting of dividends and share repurchases, exceeded the total amount of capital returned during the first 3 quarters of 2015 combined.
During the quarter, we completed a $15 billion share repurchase program approved by our board in January 2015 and, as of April 1, have begun repurchasing shares under our $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program approved in January of this year.
Since 2012, we've repurchased over 260 million shares or 17% of shares outstanding.
Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance provided to you on February 2 and summarized on Slide 25 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website.
As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patients start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA.
I will now turn the call over to Paul to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter."
29002,330109201,966828,"Gilead Sciences Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens. We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya, both in",1506,"Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens. We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya, both in the U.S. and in the European markets where we've achieved reimbursement.
Starting with the U.S. Through 5 months post the launch of Genvoya, cumulative prescriptions were twofold more than any HIV product from any company since Atripla, which was the first single-tablet regimen to come to market back in 2006. As expected, most of Genvoya's initial prescriptions came from switches. Qualitative feedback from HIV prescribers is very encouraging in indicating a clear intent to switch patients at the earliest opportunity.
Stribild and Complera showed strong year-over-year prescription growth at 18% and 5%, respectively. And in quarter 4 2015, Stribild was the leading product in the U.S. for patients naïve to treatment. With the launches of Genvoya and now, just very recently, Odefsey, we expect switches out of TDF-based single-tablet regimens into the TAF regimens to grow significantly. In fact, 82% of Genvoya's prescriptions have been switches. 49% of the switches have come from Stribild.
We are seeing an improvement in our ability to retain switch patients, meaning, fewer patients who switch from Gilead TDF-containing regimens move to non-Gilead products. Of all the patients who switched to Genvoya, 91% came from a Gilead regimen, and 9% came from a non-Gilead product.
In addition to switches, preliminary quarter 1 2016 data indicate to us that Genvoya may soon be among the most prescribed products of patients new to treatment.
Historically, in quarter 1, we've seen a decrease in sub-wholesaler inventories following a buildup in the prior quarter. We observed this effect again this year, leading to a sequential decrease in HIV product sales.
Finally, in the U.S., I'd like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP, which was more than 20% of Truvada demand last quarter and drove a 17% year-on-year growth in prescriptions.
Turning to Europe. We're also pleased with the way that our HIV business is performing with successful reimbursement and launches of Genvoya in several countries, including Germany and the Nordics. In other countries, Stribild and Eviplera continued to replace Atripla. Stribild remains the most prescribed regimen for patients naïve to treatment in the EU, with Eviplera in the third place.
Genvoya was launched in Germany during quarter 1, and at the end of the quarter, preliminary data indicate it had the leading market share for both naïve and switch patients. The product was launched and fully reimbursed in Spain just 2 weeks ago. And we're very excited about the opportunities to offer providers another important option to address the needs of their patients. It's also been recognized as a preferred regimen in numerous country guidelines, including Germany, Spain and Italy, even before reimbursement has been agreed. This is testament to the favorable clinical profile of Genvoya, a single-tablet regimen that better addresses the needs of patients who require long-term chronic therapy. We're working hard to negotiate timely reimbursement across the rest of the European markets.
Finally, in HIV, we launched Descovy this month in the U.S. and the EU. We see this launch as a milestone in HIV treatment, as Descovy is the first new NRTI backbone since Truvada 10 years ago. Given the very high use of Truvada as a preferred backbone with third -- multiple third agents, including Tivicay, we're confident that Descovy will quickly replace Truvada and become the leading HIV regimen backbone in all our markets.
Now moving to hepatitis C. We continue to see revenue dynamics around the world, which vary by country. As Robin noted, our overall HCV product revenue decreased 6% year-over-year and 12% sequentially.
I'll now describe the different dynamics by geographic region, starting with the U.S. market. We've seen an increase of new patients in the first quarter, offset by lower revenue per patient due to several factors that include an increase in our gross-to-net adjustments as well as a shortening average duration of therapy.
Total market patient starts increased around 10% over Q4 to an estimated 55,000 in Q1. This was primarily driven by the continued opening of access across payer segments to allow for the treatment of patients with low fibrosis scores as well as an increase in treatment by the VA during the second half of the quarter as funding made its way to the various VA sites. The revenue associated with this increase in patient starts was partially offset by an increase in discounts associated with our contracted -- contract agreements entered into during the first quarter of 2015, which provide for additional discounts if access is provided to a broader patient population. We also saw a gradual shift to more deeply discounted payer segments, such as VA, PHS and Medicaid, compared to the prior quarter.
In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher-than-expected prior quarter rebate claim, which come in 1 to 2 quarters in arrears and were updated in quarter 1 to reflect the higher claims received. The average duration of therapy has shortened as fewer patients require 24 weeks of treatment and a higher proportion of genotype 1 patients are treated for 8 weeks, resulting in slightly lower revenues for patients.
The ability to treat for 8 weeks, notably, has a strong competitive differentiation. In fact, our market share remained strong with more than 90% of all patients treated in the quarter being prescribed by the Harvoni or Sovaldi. Qualitative feedback suggests that prescribing HCV physicians are encouraged by the fact that real-world outcomes mimic the experience in clinical trials.
Several presentations of real-world data at EASL reinforce what has been seen in clinical practice.
As we think about the rest of the year in the U.S., patient flow peaked in quarter 1 2015 then declined in quarter 2 and stabilized in quarter 3 and quarter 4 of 2015. In quarter 1 of 2016, there was an uptick in new patient starts. Our data show that 25,000 to 30,000 patients a month are entering treated care, which exceeds the number of patients starting therapy on a monthly basis. That means there are many more people who could benefit from treatment who are already linked to care. We expect new patient starts to remain consistent through the rest of 2016.
Despite the number of patients treated today, there are still over 3,000 -- 3 million, I'm sorry, patients in the U.S. who have yet to be treated. About half of these patients are undiagnosed. Education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis are important. And as we well know from public health efforts in the HIV area, these efforts play out over many years. We're encouraged to see data that screening and diagnosis rates have increased at least twofold over the last 5 years.
Now turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in Europe was down 13% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. While overall Gilead patient starts increased 5% sequentially to around 31,000 in the quarter, average revenue per patient declined due to a shift in geographic mix and shorter average treatment duration. We also saw a negative foreign exchange movement, which affected HCV revenues by about 8% year-on-year and 3% sequentially.
The mix of sales in the EU is such that more patients and are now being treated in countries, which have lower net prices per patient. European countries continue to vary significantly in terms of patient access with many still limiting treatment to patients with high fibrosis scores. We anticipate that as sicker patients are treated, these restrictions will start to loosen as healthier patients can be cared for within existing budgets.
Again, as in the U.S., we treat just a small fraction of patients diagnosed. We are encouraged by ongoing efforts and commitments by governments to increase diagnosis and treatments across Europe.
Now moving to Japan. Revenue was over $1 billion during the quarter. We're pleased with the successful launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni where a strong patient flow and high market shares continued through quarter 1. More than 30,000 patients were treated with Gilead products during the quarter, representing a market share greater than 90%.
Other markets where we recently launched our HCV products include Australia where nearly 5,000 patients started treatment in Q1. This reflects a strong commitment by the Australian government to address their HCV burden and the usual warehousing of patients prior to the launch of sofosbuvir-based regimens.
In closing, our underlying HCV business is strong and sustainable. We've treated around 700,000 patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan. And despite strong competition, Gilead has maintained high market shares in all regions.
The Gilead commercial organization is focused on executing our numerous HIV and HCV product launches across multiple geographies during the remainder of the year. In addition to our 3 TAF-based HIV products, we're preparing to launch our pan-genotypic HCV product as early as next quarter in the U.S.

So several things happened in the quarter with -- in relation to volume and revenue per patient. So maybe I'll try and deal with all of them. So the first thing, as you've said, we had -- and we expected this and hoped for it, that several of the large commercial payers opens up access to patients regardless of their fibrosis scores during quarter 1. The consequence of that was that they triggered a discount that had been previously negotiated in order to incentivize that opening up of restrictions. So that was the first thing. And then the VA, as you know, treated very few patients in quarter 4 last year because of lack of funding. That funding was agreed for a 2-year period and focused on HCV medicines and was clarified late December. Than the VA went through a process of evaluating the clinical evaluation of products available from not just us but, obviously, new entrants to the market, and that process took through until mid to late January. And we have to negotiate with the VA, and we did give the VA some extra discounts, which resulted in them putting our products on their formulary and also opening up, again, access to all patients within the VA. So there are no restrictions on patients. And again, we see this as a large positive. And as those funding got distributed around the VA centers, we start to see a very large uptick in VA treatment from about the middle of the quarter, and we anticipate that, that will continue through the year. The second kind of area that have [ph] on course is we have the entrance of Merck into the market. And so we judiciously exercised our contractual right to preserve access. And in a few cases, we did increase a little bit of discount to some payer to ensure that Harvoni, in particular, remained on formularies and with full access. The third thing, I think, we've seen, as I indicated in the comments, was a slight and gradual shift of payer mix away from the commercial and Medicare Part D payers towards the more government payers. And that was probably about a 10% shift from quarter 4 to quarter 1. And then the final piece, as we indicate, is we did have a catch-up, a true-up of some rebate claims that came, in respect of quarter 3 and quarter 4, that were a little bit higher than we estimated last quarter and which we put right during quarter 1. So that really is the dynamic between volumes and revenue per patient."

And with the fibrosis restrictions being dropped now, most physicians can treat, starting in the commercial area and Medicare area, can treat whoever they want. One thing's clear, though, that there are still prior authorizations in place, and there's still a fair amount of office paperwork and bureaucracy that have to be put in place for each patient. Then as the patients themselves, many of whom just simply aren't quite mentally ready or psychologically ready to commit to their disciplined 8-week or 12-week treatment. And with these products, of course, if insurance comes on, came to do it twice, they want to try to get it right first time.

We are working on that. Particularly of interest to us would be accelerating the timeline for sofo/ledipasvir, because there are so many different genotypes in China.

So that's what -- there's hope, but we can't guarantee, of course, that we could accelerate that approval, to be honest in the current timeline, which is 2019. The Chinese market is fairly large.

So I'm not sure whether you looked at the data or not, but we get new to brand base, which is really the leading indicator of new starts in the quarter. So we've seen, and this is just retail scripts, by the way, so that doesn't include the VA, it doesn't include scripts that go through ESI and various other groups. So it's partly representative. And what we've seen amongst those scripts is new starts in the quarter have gone up, and that's gone up exactly in line with our expectations with the fibrosis scores being relieved. Total scripts there remained relatively flat and part of that is because in quarter 4, of course, the patient numbers, throughout, really 2015 quarter-on-quarter, the new starts were coming down. And therefore, the refills associated with those new starts falling into quarter 1 was somewhat down. So the aggregate of that makes the numbers of total prescriptions in the quarter look relatively flat and is slightly disengaged from the fibrosis piece. So I think that hopefully covers that part. And then, of course, the VA, as I said, isn't included in that group, and that was a large number of patients coming in to the system."

As I said, odd days, we got 3 different sources of data which shows that 25,000 to 30,000 patients are coming into treatment. Obviously, a lot less than that are actually being treated. And anecdotally, as I've said, I think it's because there's bureaucracy still in the physicians' offices, which give a kind of, I guess, I've to sort of guessing in a sense of number of patients that can be treated. And also, there's, from the patient side, people are actually ready to be treated. I think they want to be teed up, if you like, for treatment, but they might not want to actually starve tomorrow morning. So I think we should expect patient flow to be fairly stable through this year. And then on the negotiation side, I mean -- I think, with real-world data, payers are tending now to really take a lot more time and put a lot more thought into evaluating the clinical profiles of the products. And until we see the clinical profiles of the new products, it's very hard to predict how competitive they are. I mean, if they're competitive, I think we have to anticipate prices will come down and we'll negotiate, because we certainly don't want to lose any access to patients for our products. And we'll defend our market share vigorously. So it's hard to predict. I think, directionally, competition equals lower prices. But we're going to be focusing on looking at differentiating our products. We've got great products out there now and our pipeline looks really exciting.

And the reason had to do with the specificity. This compound is really unique. It's a known animal or inhibitor for both ACC 1 and ACC 2. And it inhibits not only the pathway that goes to de novo lipogenesis, so you know, [indiscernible] coenzymate production, but it also inhibits the level of the mitochondrium. It stimulates, I might say, a lipid asset beta oxidation. So it does really 2 things. It inhibits the formation of lipids, palmitate mostly, and at the same time, it stimulates the beta oxidation of lipids. And so we are -- there has been some anecdotal reports from the Pfizer compound that inhibition of ACC 1 and 2 results in a decrease in liver fat. That's, by the way, something we would do as one of the next experiments. We would look by MRI, on reduction of -- we've already shown at AASLD presentation that it inhibits lipogenesis. Now we have to show, also, that it inhibits lipid -- fat content of the liver. So fairly straightforward and an easy experiment to do. And I think once we've shown that, we have pretty high confidence that there would be a meaningful clinical benefit of the compound."

Gilead's HIV franchise is off to a great start with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Odefsey and Descovy, which followed the approval of Genvoya late last year. Over the last 6 months, I've had the opportunity talk with physicians and patients about the importance of having highly effective and safer options, especially for patients facing a lifetime of therapy.
With the approval of our 3 new regimens, we are now able to offer a range of options to address the diverse medical requirements of people with HIV, including those new to treatment, those who've been on therapy for a long time and have run short of options and those who desire to switch medications for a variety of reasons.
Since 2001, Gilead therapies have played a transformative role in changing HIV infection from a fatal and debilitating disease into a chronic and manageable condition. That's true around the world, as broader access to HIV treatment has helped divert millions of AIDS deaths.
Innovation remains important in the continuing fighting of HIV, and we're proud that Descovy is the first new backbone approved by the FDA in more than a decade.
Gilead continues the commitment to helping HIV patients around the globe with our research and development activities, including novel agents for daily treatment, long-acting regimens and HIV cure.
In liver disease, we just wrapped up an exciting week in Barcelona at the International Liver Conference (sic) [ International Liver Congress
], or EASL, as it's known. It was a remarkable meeting, especially considering the significant change in the HCV treatment landscape since the conference was held last in Spain 4 years ago. The outlook for patients has completely changed with dramatic improvements in cure rates for a wider range of patients.
Presentations at EASL included results from several Phase II and Phase III studies evaluating sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir plus GS-9857. These are 2 investigational pan-genotypic fixed-dose combination therapies for the treatment of HCV.
The data presented continues to underscore the high cure rates and safety of our sofosbuvir-based therapies and support their utility across all HCV patient genotypes in a wide range of disease stages.
Data were also presented on the use of TAF for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 48-week results from 2 Phase III studies demonstrate its potential to advance the treatment of HPV, offering a similar efficacy profile to Viread with improved bone and renal safety parameters. Based on these results, we submitted a new drug application for TAF, and FDA has set a PDUFA date of November 11.
We also submitted regulatory applications for TAF in the European Union and Japan last quarter.
I'm particularly encouraged by the work that's going on in NASH, which we've augmented with our agreement to acquire the Nimbus Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, or ACC, program, as was announced last month. NASH affects up to 15 million people in the U.S. and is expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020.
Including the ACC program, Gilead has 4 investigational compounds that target unique disease pathways, including production of lipids, inflammation and fibrosis, each of which are thought to contribute to or cause NASH. Data in EASL represented support in the development of Gilead's investigational agents for the treatment of NASH, including simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that is selected for LOXL2, which is also being evaluated in primary sclerosing cholangitis; GS-4997, an ASK1 inhibitor; and GS-9674, an FXR agonist. Nimbus also presented positive Phase I data for the program's lead candidate, NDI-010976, which targets ACC, the key step in lipid biosynthesis pathway.
Overall, I'm enthusiastic about the future of Gilead and excited to have the opportunity to help build on the company's long history of success. Over the past few months, I've had conversations with external stakeholders and employees across all parts of our organization. It's gratifying to see the extent to which Gilead's products and commitment to access have uniquely changed the course of diseases for so many people throughout the world. We now have the opportunity to do so again in many new areas.
A few things stood out during the conversation. First, physicians and patients share the excitement that our medical and commercial teams have regarding Gilead's new treatment options for HCV and HIV, particularly the new TAF-based therapies. Access continues to improve for people with HCV around the world, and in fact, we have treated close to 1 million patients with sofosbuvir-based regimens since Sovaldi was first approved in late 2013. That's a remarkable achievement in just over 2 years.
With regards to HIV, as many of you are aware, TAF was added to the Medicines Patent Pool and to our various Access Programs. The clinical data suggest TAF-based regimens may be the best option in both the developed and developing world. We will build on success we've had with the TDF-based regimens, now used by nearly 10 million people every single day, to make TAF regimens accessible around the world, providing much-needed new options.
Secondly, I believe we have a rich pipeline, creating opportunities that may allow the transformation of the treatment of many diseases like NASH, HPV, inflammatory diseases, certain cancers and cardiovascular conditions, for which few, if any, options exist.
We are committed to building on our company's long history of success, and I'm confident that our innovation and hard work will deliver on our shared goal of delivering new treatments and providing broad access to Gilead's medicines for patients in need.
Finally, we continue to look for business development opportunities that add to our core therapeutic areas and are a fit with Gilead's expertise and capabilities. We are actively assessing options and we'll make moves when the right opportunities present themselves.
I will now turn the call over to Robin, who'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Robin will be followed by Paul, who'll provide additional color on the company's performance across products and geographies."
29002,330109201,966885,"Gilead Sciences Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report our first quarter results with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, u",930,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report our first quarter results with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. Product sales for the quarter were $7.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially.
Starting with HIV and other antivirals. Product sales for the first quarter increased to $2.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased sales in the U.S.
We continue to see strong uptake of our newer single-tablet regimens, including Genvoya, which was launched in November 2015. Additionally, year-over-year, Stribild and Complera grew 34% and 19%, respectively.
Sequentially, these sales decreased 4% primarily driven by sub-wholesaler inventory decreases in the U.S., reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from quarter 4 to quarter 1.
HCV product sales for the first quarter decreased 6% year-over-year to $4.3 billion primarily driven by a decrease in Harvoni sales in the U.S., which was partially offset by the launch of our HCV products in Japan and other international markets.
In the U.S., the year-over-year Harvoni sales decline was driven by lower patient starts and the full-quarter impact of higher commercial rebates, which were entered into during the first quarter of 2015.
Sequentially, HCV product sales decreased 12%, primarily driven by revenue declines in the U.S. and Japan. In the U.S., the decline was due to the increase in discounts required to open up access to patients with lower fibrosis scores and a modest shift in payer mix towards more deeply discounted government payer segments.
In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher-than-expected prior quarter rebate claims. Rebate claims come in 1 to 2 quarters in arrears and were updated in Q1 to reflect the higher claims received.
In Japan, Sovaldi volumes declined from high early-launch levels, similar to other markets, and channel inventory pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni was adjusted during March for the mandatory price reduction effective as of April 1.
Turning to our other therapeutic areas. Product sales of cardiovascular, respiratory and other were $498 million, up 19% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially.
Moving to gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 90.9% for the same period last year. The decrease reflects a $200 million charge or $0.12 earnings per share related to the jury verdict in the Merck trial in March. Although the proceedings in the Merck trial are not complete and the losing party will appeal once the court enters judgment, we booked the charge to comply with accounting rules related to contingencies.
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense -- expenses were $769 million for the first quarter, up 18% compared to the same period last year, due to the continued progression of clinical studies, particularly in liver disease and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $638 million for the first quarter, up 6% compared to the same period last year. These expenses increased primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of Gilead's business and were offset by favorable adjustments related to the Branded Prescription Drug fee of $191 million, following the receipt of the preliminary 2016 IRS invoice.
From a balance sheet perspective, during the first quarter, we generated cash flows from operations of $3.9 billion and ended the quarter with $21.3 billion in cash and investments.
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per share for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. $8 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase shares of our common stock during the quarter, consisting of $3 billion of open-market repurchases or 33.4 million shares, and $5 billion under the accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, that we announced in February. 46.1 million shares were repurchased under this program during the quarter. The final settlement of the ASR program was completed earlier this month, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares. In total, 54.3 million shares were retired under the ASR program at an average price of $92.09 per share.
As of March 31, the amount of capital returned to shareholders, consisting of dividends and share repurchases, exceeded the total amount of capital returned during the first 3 quarters of 2015 combined.
During the quarter, we completed a $15 billion share repurchase program approved by our board in January 2015 and, as of April 1, have begun repurchasing shares under our $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program approved in January of this year.
Since 2012, we've repurchased over 260 million shares or 17% of shares outstanding.
Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance provided to you on February 2 and summarized on Slide 25 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website.
As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patients start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA.
I will now turn the call over to Paul to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter."
29002,330109201,966885,"Gilead Sciences Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens. We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya, both in",1504,"Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens. We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya, both in the U.S. and in the European markets where we've achieved reimbursement.
Starting with the U.S. Through 5 months post the launch of Genvoya, cumulative prescriptions were twofold more than any HIV product from any company since Atripla, which was the first single-tablet regimen to come to market back in 2006. As expected, most of Genvoya's initial prescriptions came from switches. Qualitative feedback from HIV prescribers is very encouraging in indicating a clear intent to switch patients at the earliest opportunity.
Stribild and Complera showed strong year-over-year prescription growth at 18% and 5%, respectively. And in quarter 4 2015, Stribild was the leading product in the U.S. for patients naïve to treatment. With the launches of Genvoya and now, just very recently, Odefsey, we expect switches out of TDF-based single-tablet regimens into the TAF regimens to grow significantly. In fact, 82% of Genvoya's prescriptions have been switches. 49% of the switches have come from Stribild.
We are seeing an improvement in our ability to retain switch patients, meaning, fewer patients who switch from Gilead TDF-containing regimens move to non-Gilead products. Of all the patients who switched to Genvoya, 91% came from a Gilead regimen, and 9% came from a non-Gilead product.
In addition to switches, preliminary quarter 1 2016 data indicate to us that Genvoya may soon be among the most prescribed products of patients new to treatment.
Historically, in quarter 1, we've seen a decrease in sub-wholesaler inventories following a buildup in the prior quarter. We observed this effect again this year, leading to a sequential decrease in HIV product sales.
Finally, in the U.S., I'd like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP, which was more than 20% of Truvada demand last quarter and drove a 17% year-on-year growth in prescriptions.
Turning to Europe. We're also pleased with the way that our HIV business is performing with successful reimbursement and launches of Genvoya in several countries, including Germany and the Nordics. In other countries, Stribild and Eviplera continue to replace Atripla. Stribild remains the most prescribed regimen for patients naïve to treatment in the EU, with Eviplera in third place.
Genvoya was launched in Germany during quarter 1, and at the end of the quarter, preliminary data indicate it had the leading market share for both naïve and switch patients. The product was launched and fully reimbursed in Spain just 2 weeks ago. And we're very excited about the opportunities to offer providers another important option to address the needs of their patients. It's also been recognized as a preferred regimen in numerous country guidelines, including Germany, Spain and Italy, even before reimbursement has been agreed. This is testament to the favorable clinical profile of Genvoya, a single-tablet regimen that better addresses the needs of patients who require long-term chronic therapy. We're working hard to negotiate timely reimbursement across the rest of the European markets.
Finally, in HIV, we launched Descovy this month in the U.S. and the EU. We see this launch as a milestone in HIV treatment, as Descovy is the first new NRTI backbone since Truvada 10 years ago. Given the very high use of Truvada as a preferred backbone with third -- multiple third agents, including Tivicay, we're confident that Descovy will quickly replace Truvada and become the leading HIV regimen backbone in all our markets.
Now moving to hepatitis C. We continue to see revenue dynamics around the world, which vary by country. As Robin noted, our overall HCV product revenue decreased 6% year-over-year and 12% sequentially.
I'll now describe the different dynamics by geographic region, starting with the U.S. market. We've seen an increase of new patients in the first quarter, offset by lower revenue per patient due to several factors that include an increase in our gross-to-net adjustments as well as a shortening average duration of therapy.
Total market patient starts increased around 10% over Q4 to an estimated 55,000 in Q1. This was primarily driven by the continued opening of access across payer segments to allow for the treatment of patients with low fibrosis scores as well as an increase in treatment by the VA during the second half of the quarter as funding made its way to the various VA sites. The revenue associated with this increase in patient starts was partially offset by an increase in discounts associated with our contracted -- contract agreements entered into during the first quarter of 2015, which provide for additional discounts if access is provided to a broader patient population. We also saw a gradual shift to more deeply discounted payer segments, such as VA, PHS and Medicaid, compared to the prior quarter.
In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher-than-expected prior quarter rebate claim, which come in 1 to 2 quarters in arrears and were updated in quarter 1 to reflect the higher claims received. The average duration of therapy has shortened as fewer patients require 24 weeks of treatment and a higher proportion of genotype 1 patients are treated for 8 weeks, resulting in slightly lower revenues for patients.
The ability to treat for 8 weeks, notably, has a strong competitive differentiation. In fact, our market share remained strong with more than 90% of all patients treated in the quarter being prescribed by the Harvoni or Sovaldi. Qualitative feedback suggests that prescribing HCV physicians are encouraged by the fact that real-world outcomes mimic the experience in clinical trials.
Several presentations of real-world data at EASL reinforce what has been seen in clinical practice.
As we think about the rest of the year in the U.S., patient flow peaked in quarter 1 2015 then declined in quarter 2 and stabilized in quarter 3 and quarter 4 of 2015. In quarter 1 of 2016, there was an uptick in new patient starts. Our data showed that 25,000 to 30,000 patients a month are entering treated care, which exceeds the number of patients starting therapy on a monthly basis. That means there are many more people who could benefit from treatment who are already linked to care. We expect new patient starts to remain consistent through the rest of 2016.
Despite the number of patients treated today, there are still over 3,000 -- 3 million, I'm sorry, patients in the U.S. who have yet to be treated. About half of these patients are undiagnosed. Education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis are important. And as we well know from public health efforts in the HIV area, these efforts play out over many years. We're encouraged to see data that screening and diagnosis rates have increased at least twofold over the last 5 years.
Now turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in Europe was down 13% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. While overall Gilead patient starts increased 5% sequentially to around 31,000 in the quarter, average revenue per patient declined due to a shift in geographic mix and shorter average treatment duration. We also saw a negative foreign exchange movement, which affected HCV revenues by about 8% year-on-year and 3% sequentially.
The mix of sales in the EU is such that more patients are now being treated in countries which have lower net prices per patient. European countries continue to vary significantly in terms of patient access with many still limiting treatment to patients with high fibrosis scores. We anticipate that as sicker patients are treated, these restrictions will start to loosen as healthier patients can be cared for within existing budgets.
Again, as in the U.S., we treat just a small fraction of patients diagnosed. We are encouraged by ongoing efforts and commitments by governments to increase diagnosis and treatments across Europe.
Now moving to Japan. Revenue was over $1 billion during the quarter. We're pleased with the successful launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni where a strong patient flow and high market shares continued through quarter 1. More than 30,000 patients were treated with Gilead products during the quarter, representing a market share greater than 90%.
Other markets where we recently launched our HCV products include Australia where nearly 5,000 patients started treatment in Q1. This reflects a strong commitment by the Australian government to address their HCV burden and the usual warehousing of patients prior to the launch of sofosbuvir-based regimens.
In closing, our underlying HCV business is strong and sustainable. We've treated around 700,000 patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan. And despite strong competition, Gilead has maintained high market shares in all regions.
The Gilead commercial organization is focused on executing our numerous HIV and HCV product launches across multiple geographies during the remainder of the year. In addition to our 3 TAF-based HIV products, we're preparing to launch our pan-genotypic HCV product as early as next quarter in the U.S.

So several things happened in the quarter with -- in relation to volume and revenue per patient. So maybe I'll try and deal with all of them. So the first thing, as you've said, we had -- and we expected this and hoped for it, that several of the large commercial payers opens up access to patients regardless of their fibrosis scores during quarter 1. The consequence of that was that they triggered a discount that had been previously negotiated in order to incentivize that opening up of restrictions. So that was the first thing. And then the VA, as you know, treated very few patients in quarter 4 last year because of lack of funding. That funding was agreed for a 2-year period and focused on HCV medicines and was clarified late December. Than the VA went through a process of evaluating the clinical evaluation of products available from not just us but, obviously, new entrants to the market, and that process took through until mid to late January. And we have to negotiate with the VA, and we did give the VA some extra discounts, which resulted in them putting our products on their formulary and also opening up, again, access to all patients within the VA. So there are no restrictions on patients. And again, we see this as a large positive. And as those funding got distributed around the VA centers, we start to see a very large uptick in VA treatment from about the middle of the quarter, and we anticipate that, that will continue through the year. The second kind of area that happened, of course, was we have the entrance of Merck into the market. And so we judiciously exercise our contractual right to preserve access. And in a few cases, we did increase a little bit of discount to some payer to ensure that Harvoni, in particular, remains on formularies and with full access. The third thing I think we've seen, as I indicated in the comments, was a slight and gradual shift of payer mix away from the commercial and Medicare Part D payers towards the more government payers. And that was probably about a 10% shift from quarter 4 to quarter 1. And then the final piece, as we indicate, is we did have a catch-up, a true-up of some rebate claims that came, in respect to quarter 3 and quarter 4, that were a little bit higher than we estimated last quarter and which we put right during quarter 1. So that really is the dynamic between volumes and revenue per patient."

One thing's clear, though, that there are still prior authorizations in place, and there's still a fair amount of office paperwork and bureaucracy that have to be put in place for each patient. Then as the patients themselves, many of whom just simply aren't quite mentally ready or psychologically ready to commit to their disciplined 8-week or 12-week treatment. And with these products, of course, if insurance comes on, keen to do it twice, they want to try to get it right first time.

We are working on that. Particularly of interest to us would be accelerating the timeline for sofo/ledipasvir, because there are so many different genotypes in China. Genotyping is not common in China, and this could provide a very good option for the people of China. So that would -- there's hope, but we can't guarantee, of course, that we could accelerate that approval, to be honest in the current timeline, which is 2019. The Chinese market is fairly large.

So I'm not sure whether you looked at this data or not, but we get new to brand base, which is really the leading indicator of new starts in the quarter. So we've seen, and this is just retail scripts, by the way, so that doesn't include the VA, it doesn't include scripts that go through ESI and various other groups. So it's partly representative. And what we've seen amongst those scripts is new starts in the quarter have gone up, and that's gone up exactly in line with our expectations with the fibrosis scores being relieved. Total scripts there remained relatively flat and part of that is because in quarter 4, of course, the patient numbers, throughout, really 2015 quarter-on-quarter, the new starts were coming down. And therefore, the refills associated with those new starts falling into quarter 1 was somewhat down. So the aggregate of that makes the numbers of total prescriptions in the quarter look relatively flat and is slightly disengaged from the fibrosis piece. So I think that hopefully covers that part. And then, of course, the VA, as I said, isn't included in that group, and that was a large number of patients coming in to the system."

As I said, odd days, we got 3 different sources of data which shows that 25,000 to 30,000 patients are coming into treatment. Obviously, a lot less than that are actually being treated. And anecdotally, as I've said, I think it's because there's bureaucracy still in the physicians' offices, which give a kind of, I guess, I have to sort of guessing in a sense of number of patients that can be treated. And also, there's, from the patient side, people are actually ready to be treated. I think they want to be teed up, if you like, for treatment, but they might not want to actually starve tomorrow morning. So I think we should expect patient flow to be fairly stable through this year. And then on the negotiation side, I mean -- I think, with real-world data, payers are tending now to really take a lot more time and put a lot more thought into evaluating the clinical profiles of the products. And until we see the clinical profiles of the new products, it's very hard to predict how competitive they are. I mean, if they're competitive, I think we have to anticipate prices will come down and we'll negotiate, because we certainly don't want to lose any access to patients for our products. And we'll defend our market share vigorously. So it's hard to predict. I think, directionally, competition equals lower prices.

It stimulates, I might say, lipid asset beta oxidation. So it does really 2 things. It inhibits the formation of lipids, palmitate mostly, and at the same time, it stimulates the beta oxidation of lipids. And so we are -- there has been some anecdotal reports from the Pfizer compound that inhibition of ACC 1 and 2 results in a decrease in liver fat. That's, by the way, something we would do as one of the next experiments. We would look by MRI, on reduction of -- we've already shown at the EASL presentation that it inhibits lipogenesis.

We are pleased to share results for the second quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin and John will then make a few comments. 
Total revenues for the second quarter was $7.8 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.08. This compares to revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter was $7.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, we saw an increase in HIV, U.S. HCV and other product sales that were offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe. 
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the second quarter was $4.9 billion, down 12% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2.3 billion, down 33% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates and discounts due primarily to payer mix and lower patient starts for Harvoni, as the initial group of warehoused patients was treated in 2015. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were up 13%, driven by a $270 million adjustment to our HCV sales returns reserve rate and the initial inventory build for Epclusa. Strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens drove 23% year-over-year and 11% sequential growth of our HIV product sales. The quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion were also positively impacted by the upward trajectory of Truvada used for PrEP.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and a higher proportion of patient starts from countries that have a lower net average price. Sequentially, sales in Europe were flat, excluding the impact of currency movements, with HIV sales growth offset by lower HCV sales. 
In Japan, product sales for the second quarter were $619 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of lower patient starts from Harvoni and the full quarter effect of the mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were discussed during our last call. 
Moving to gross margin. Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 92% and benefited from the reversal of a $200 million litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016, following the favorable decision in the Merck case. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 48% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher and the progression of clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were up 10% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. From a balance sheet perspective, during the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion and ended the quarter with $24.6 billion in cash and investments. While our cash flows will remain strong in the second half of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q3 2016 due to required cash payments related to our current government rebates in the U.S. and abroad as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline progression. 
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares in April 2016 from the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program announced in February 2016. The total share repurchases in the first half of the year were $98.2 million at a cost of $90 billion. As previously communicated, we anticipate share repurchases in second half of 2016 to be lower than the first half of 2016 as we focus our capital allocation on advancing our R&D opportunities. 
Finally, we are updating full year 2016 guidance, which is outlined on Slide 21. The changes are as follows: we are lowering net product sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. While we are seeing continued strength in non-HCV product sales, given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV, our updated models for just net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below $30 billion for the year. As such, we believe it is prudent to update our full year 2016 guidance. The factors contributing to this conclusion include: lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segments in the U.S. and [indiscernible] with a lower net average price in Europe; a trend towards slowing patient starts in the U.S. Commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe; the continued gradual trend towards shorter duration; and loss of some market share to competition. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including potential changes in the global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in our HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing commercial payer contract negotiations; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
We are increasing our R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, driven by acquisition-related expenses for Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher, slightly offset by lower-than-anticipated clinical trial expenses. 
We are lowering SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by the favorable onetime adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the Branded Prescription Drug fee, which lowered Q1 2016 SG&A expense. 
Diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related upfront collaboration, stock-based compensation and other expenses increases to a new range of $1.47 to $1.53 as a result of our recent M&A activity. All other components of our 2016 guidance remain unchanged. 
I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin."

Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity. Working with exceptional executive colleagues around the table here in [indiscernible] City, interacting with my senior operating management team and seeing the dedication of thousands of Gilead employees around the world leaves me in no doubt as to the long-term prospects for this outstanding company. 
While still early days, over the last 2 months in my new role, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Gilead's recent product introductions, the evolving health care landscape and the operating challenges on our near-term horizon. I'd like to share 3 general observations with you today. 
First, I am struck by the commitment that you shared, by physicians, payers and governments around the world, to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C. Even countries with challenging economic circumstances are finding ways to prioritize the treatment of HCV patients. In the 2.5 years since the launch of Sovaldi, more than 1 million patients have been treated on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Beneath this aggregated number are several landmark statistics. The United States has already treated nearly 0.5 million patients to date with Sovaldi and Harvoni. Equally, over 200,000 patients in Europe have been treated with Gilead regimens. Japan has treated approximately 100,000 patients in a little over a year. And just this year, Australia has treated an estimated 17,000 patients in a matter of months. Health care systems have demonstrably mobilized to reach those patients most in need. These are remarkable facts that clearly underscore the profile of the products we have introduced. Equally, they have implications to longer-term treatment dynamics and portfolio life cycles. Secondly, in the area of HIV, I'm impressed by how the clinical data for TAF-based regimens are resonating with the many constituents who tirelessly drive for better patient care. The understanding that these regimens can help address a growing need for highly effective and safer treatment options for lifelong HIV therapy is evidenced by the early success of Genvoya. I will highlight some impressive data points later.
Thirdly, I'll remind you just how complex the delivery of health care continues to be. Gilead's focus on flawless execution, on controlling the variables that we can control with the highest levels of competence and compliance is critical and is my top priority. 
Now let me take you through the details of the commercial performance for the second quarter. Starting with HCV. In the U.S., total HCV revenue is $2.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 33% year-over-year. Since the beginning of the year, access has improved and almost all major commercial payers have been moved by [indiscernible] criteria, joining Medicare and the VA in this regard. Medicaid remains the only payer segment where use is still generally restricted to the sicker patients. There are other significant barriers to access, but we are encouraged that some states have recently moved away from fibrosis restrictions towards more open access.
In terms of patient starts, approximately 69,000 [ph] people began HCV therapy in the second quarter, and an estimated 90% of these patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Importantly, third-party databases suggest that new patients are being identified through increased screening efforts. As evidenced, approximately 14 million people were screened for HCV for the period of 2014 through 2015, and approximately 280,000 were confirmed RNA positive in that 2-year period. These figures represent a significant increase from the years prior to the launch of Sovaldi. We estimate that 3 million individuals remain infected with HCV in the U.S., approximately half of whom are diagnosed.
Although patient starts increased for the second consecutive quarter and patient inflows into care remain recently steady at around 30,000 patients a month, the dynamics vary by patient segments. 
Within the commercial and Medicare segments, some larger payers have recently opened up access. We now estimate that up to 90% of all commercial covered lives have access without regard to fibrosis score. While the payers that recently opened up access are bringing in more patients, we are seeing a modest downward trend in patient starts among payers that have had full access in place for longer periods of time. The sickest patients have largely been treated, and the movement we are seeing is towards treating genotype 1 patients with low fibrosis scores and thus greater use of the 8-week treatment regimen for Harvoni. 
In terms of all new HCV treatment starts in the second quarter, approximately 45% came from within the public payer systems. We anticipate this percentage will remain largely the same through the remainder of the year. The VA is one example of a payer within this segment, and their commitment to treating and curing [indiscernible] who have HCV using budget allocated by Congress to do so is truly groundbreaking. We are aware that in some cities, extra clinics have been scheduled to help shoulder the workload. However, we also expect that in the longer term, disadvantaged patients within the VA system will be harder to reach and bring into care and that the rate of treatment will decline.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $775 million, down 32% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Overall, Gilead patient starts decreased to around 28,000 for the quarter. We observed steady treatment rates in Italy and Spain but lower numbers in early launch markets like Germany and France. Patient starts in the U.K. continue to be limited by NHS England budget restrictions. Additionally, we saw a slight decline in average treatment duration, as countries like Germany are treating more patients with low fibrosis scores, who qualify for an 8-week treatment duration.
In several European markets, locally documented cure rates are equal to, if not better than, what was demonstrated in Sovaldi and Harvoni clinical studies. This has resonated with governments and payer bodies, and some countries such as France are considering removing all fibrosis score criteria. We will watch this picture closely and share evolving news with you in the future. 
Moving to Japan. As Robin mentioned, revenue was $619 million, down 43% sequentially. We believe this was related to 2 factors: first, the decline in genotype 1 new patient starts following the Q1 2016 peak when a very large number of individuals with advanced disease initiated therapy; and second, the full treatment effect of a mandatory price reduction previously described on last quarter's call.
Finally, for HCV, a [indiscernible] was recently approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada. These approvals are true milestones in patient care since Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic, once-daily, single-tablet option. Epclusa will be an important treatment option in the U.S. as an estimated 20% to 25% of HCV patients have genotypes 2 and 3. And equally, across Europe, there are some countries that have up to 30% of patients with genotype 3 alone. 
In concluding my remarks on hepatitis C, I will return to my earlier comments. Gilead is proud to be part of a fundamental disease paradigm shift, delivering disease cures to virtually all patients treated. That's why we developed Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa and have a third single-tablet regimen in clinical testing. 
Whilst the pace of new patient treatments may slow in coming years and quantifying that pace is incredibly hard, there is still an opportunity to identify and cure many HCV infected people around the globe. 
Moving to HIV. We are pleased with the launch of our top-based [ph] products in the U.S. and in the European markets where we have already achieved reimbursement. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.2 billion, up 11% sequentially, and Genvoya revenue nearly doubled in Q2 versus Q1. The product represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atripla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago. After its first 6 months of availability, Genvoya is already the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. 
78% of all Genvoya prescriptions have come from switches. Half of the switches have come from Stribild, and importantly, 10% of switches have come from non-Gilead therapies. Among all patients who switched, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product. 
Whilst still in the early stages of the [indiscernible] and Descovy launches, we are seeing similar patient dynamic to Genvoya. Over 90% of all [indiscernible] and Descovy prescriptions have come from switches. And 6% and 11% of switches, respectively, have come from non-Gilead therapies. 
Finally, in the U.S., I would like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP. We estimate somewhere in the order of 60,000 to 70,000 patients were using Truvada for PrEP in the second quarter. This number accounts for approximately 1/3 of Truvada demand. This is encouraging, as we know Truvada has an important role to play as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for many at-risk individuals.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $755 million, up 5% sequentially, driven by the launches of Genvoya and Descovy. Genvoya has gained pricing approval in 11 countries and is now the market leader in Germany for both treatment-naïve and switch patients after only 6 month of availability. We anticipate additional launches in France, Italy and the U.K. in the second half of the year. 
Genvoya is a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including Italy, where it was added before pricing and reimbursement. Preferred listings are anticipated in other EU guidelines later this year and into 2017. EACS guidelines are expected to be updated, following the HIV Glasgow 2016 Conference in October.
Finally, I would like to briefly update you on the outstanding performance of the Gilead U.S. cardiovascular team. Letairis and Ranexa together generated $356 million in revenue during the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, over 0.25 million people in the United States regularly receive Ranexa. And Letairis remains the overall ERA market leader in PAH. 
In closing, Gilead achieved a great deal of across our operations during the quarter, and I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in the second half of 2016. 
I would now like to turn the call over to John."
29002,369689622,1011501,"Gilead Sciences Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Before I get started, I just want to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a f",1154,"Thanks, Kevin. Before I get started, I just want to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. 
Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments of my own. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made great progress in helping provide access to Sovaldi and Harvoni for HCV patients. Throughout the world, more than 1 million HCV sufferers have not been treated, with nearly half of those coming from the U.S. A lot of these drugs were unprecedented in our industry, and patients are treated at a much faster initial rate than we or anyone else possible. Looking back, we can now say that in every country, the peak number of patients treated was achieved within 2 or 3 quarters of the launch of Harvoni. And that peak number is far higher than what we had -- what had ever been achieved before, about 3x that seen with the launch of the HCV in 2011.
As we've reached the mid-point of this year, we now see the market maturing to a slower rate of treatment for HCV-infected individuals. And as we think about this one more normal patient starts, there are a few things to keep in mind. As Kevin mentioned, there are about 3 million people who are infected in the U.S., and slightly more than half of those have been diagnosed. Many of these diagnosed patients have less advanced liver disease upon reentering care. For example, in the United States in the second quarter this year, we estimate that only 13% of patients starting treatment had F4 fibrosis scores compared with more than 21% the year prior to that. With less severely ill patients, there is less urgency to immediately treat patients. This may explain the slower rate of treatment versus last year. However, we do believe these patients will eventually benefit from treatment, and this means the flow of patients will continue for many years to come.
There's also an opportunity to diagnose patients [indiscernible] into care. As Kevin mentioned, we estimate that about 280,000 HCV patients are diagnosed in the U.S. in the last 2 years. So the value and importance of the U.S. GDP recommendations for HCV testing. So while there has been a slowing of treatment compared to the rush of patients when Sovaldi and Harvoni where first approved, the HCV market is attractive over the longer term providing the revenues, strong cash flow and earnings per share on top of our base business and chronic therapies. 
Because of this, our focus on improving care for HCV and affected individuals has not wavered. Beyond the recent approvals of Epclusa, we are actively working on a third single-tablet regimen that combines the 2 active ingredients in Epclusa with the third investigational compound, [indiscernible]. This combination, known as SOF/VEL box, is being evaluated at 4 Phase III clinical trials among patients who have previously failed direct and develop treatments. It's also being studied for its potential to offer an 8-week treatment duration for treatment-naïve patients of all genotypes. We expect to have top line data available for SOF/VEL box by the end of the year. 
We're making tremendous minus headway in HIV as well, both of our portfolio of newer products and our pipeline. We've had several key approvals with Descovy approved in U.S. and Europe last quarter and Odefsey approved an earlier this month. It's clear these medications offer a significant advance for patients, and that advance has been recognized now by multiple professionals and public health groups, including the International Antiviral Society of the U.S.A. and the Department of Health and Human Services, both of which were released updated guidance of use TAF-based regimens for initial HIV therapy. 
We continue to generate clinical data that support the favorable time to fix and medical performance of our TAF-based products. Last week, we announced the results of 2 Phase IIIb switch studies evaluating Odefsey and Biologics suppressed, switching from comp there or Atripla. Of this he achieved similar rates of urological suppression as the TDF-based regimen. These studies reinforce efficacy of Odefsey as with the renal and bones of the advantages, and we plan to present data cents later this year. 
Last month, we presented the first human data on [indiscernible], our investigational, integration inhibitor at the American Society for Microbiology. Data from 4 preclinical and Phase I studies examined the antiviral processes, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics and safety of tenofovir providing the rationale to further evaluate the compound. Dolutegravir is part of a single-tablet regimen and combination with TAF and [indiscernible], is currently in Phase III trial. Enrollment of more than 2,300 patients across 4 registrational studies was completed earlier this month. The 48-weak endpoints for this study will be reached in the second quarter of next year, and the data play out as we all, NDA and MAA filings could occur in the third quarter of 2017.
With the approval and rapid adoption of our TAF-based regimens, an exciting new STR and Phase III development and an active HIV research pipeline, I'm confident that we will be able to extend our leadership position in the HIV market and broaden our ability to help even more patients around the world. 
Outside of working antivirals, Gilead is focused on some of the biggest health challenges today. Several important data sets that are anticipated in the second half of this year may help us to find a strategy of pathway forward for tackling these challenges. And our Nass program, where we have 4 active clinical programs, we'll have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997, our S-1 inhibitor and simtuzumab, our monoclonal antibody and [indiscernible]. 2 The Phase II study of simtuzumab for primary sclerosing will also conclude. We will also have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997 in diabetic and pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH. And finally, we expect data from 2 Phase III studies of myelofibrosis before the end of the year. If these data are positive, these studies will form the basis for an MDA filing in the first quarter of 2017. 
These are important milestones and represent a great deal of work across the organization to enroll and advance these studies and analyze complex data sets as they become available. Gilead continues to innovate in every level and every part of the organization. Next month, we will publish our first corporate social responsibility report that looks at access sustainability, graph making and other positive contributions to the communities we serve, and I urge you to read it. I'm proud of the work that's been that way our employees and extend my many thanks to the for all the ways they are making a difference of around the world.

I am not at all pessimistic about the long-term prospects for hepatitis C. In fact, I'm rather optimistic. I think what we have seen 2014, 2015 is an enormous group of the less well patients treated, particularly by specialists, hepatitis C treaters. It's really quite amazing. I think this quarter, we've highlighted perhaps going forward is really sort of a payer mix situation that we've got. The VA has definitely increased in terms of its contribution to the 69,000 [ph] total HCV starts, which, of course, was an increase on quarter 1. So a lot of VA patients are coming through, and the VA is very, very motivated to try to essentially eradicate the drivers from that population. I think, yes, we did see pickup in 2 of the large players that came onstream with open fibrosis scores from the beginning of the year, but we did see some downtick in other commercial payers. So net-net, it was slightly a decrease in overall commercial patients. What I feel about the long term and as we go into years further forward and we kind of hit an equilibrium of patients is all around what I mentioned and John mentioned, around diagnoses. There's been a considerable pickup in the number of HCV tests, 2014, 2015, about a 65% increase in the number of HCV tests. 280,000 in that 2-year period were HCV net positive. So as John said, they will eventually work their way through treatment. But still over  1/4 of the population being diagnosed is at 4. So there's still a lot of sickness out there in patients. So whilst the health care system here and some of the European markets have done heroic things in treating patients in the last 2 years, I still think, with 1.5 million diagnosed patients in the United States, that we are going to see a continued healthy flow of patients that can benefit from our products."

So following up on this issue of HCV outlook, historically, in this category, after each market has peaked, it's begun a steady slow, sometimes slow anyway, decline.

Are you suggesting to us that you think that there is a stable outlook for the HCV revenue on a market-by-market basis from these levels? Or are you suggesting that we should see more like an orderly and steady decline?

I can certainly, at some point, comment on that this afternoon. I think, from my perspective and Robin, John around the table year, I think it's more of the latter comment that there will continue to be a gradual decline in new patient starts. But an equilibrium will be eventually hit. Quite the timing of that, Jeff, it's really, really, really hard to take. I've just got to believe that with the amount of testing, with the amount of diagnoses with the CDC guidelines, Gilead itself in Q3, Q4 this year going do some more educational programs around the need to test and treat that, we will eventually hit an equilibrium. In terms of Europe, Italy and Spain are very steady. I should tell you that in Italy, there are still 200,000 quite sick individuals, people to be treated and they're in treated care. And the Italian government do want to go ahead and try and mobilize providers to do that treating. So there's still an enormous number initially. I think the more -- the markets are more akin to the U.S. like, first and foremost, Germany and, to a slightly lesser extent, France, starting to see that sort of turnover of patients. We've got full access in terms of fibrosis score in Germany. And we're hoping, as I said, that we get broad access in France. The U.K. is a different situation, and that's largely due to payer restrictions. But again, still an enthusiasm to treat, but 1 or 2 of those markets, there is some maturing going on."

We hope that will add the presentation in the first quarter rated by ASL the hopefully, the abstract deadline. Then you asked a question about we have 2 other compounds in development. Well, you know what we're pursuing, maybe I should answer this more generally, so we're pursuing 3 approaches to hepatitis B cure. So one is adding another different mechanism to the nucleotides because there's observation that despite being under hepatitis B therapies like Gilead or TAF, there was always a little bit of virus left, HCV maybe takes about, if you look at their your sensitive methods. So by adding another mechanism to a weaker completely suppressed there was down to 0, would that lead to an eventual cure or hepatitis [indiscernible] conversion? The second thing we're pursuing is immunotherapy, so that belongs to vaccine and the TLR-7 that I talked about already. And we have a TLR 8 agonist currently that is working its way towards an IND.

We've seen very little change, really, in the scale and size of our Medicaid business. I think it would be true to say that Medicaid's the states are slowly progressively opening up. 40% of Medicaid patients come from the 5 largest states. 2 of those, New York and Florida, now have no fibrosis score. So as states do progressively consider opening up, they typically come to us for a contract. We think about those contracts very carefully. Depending on the size of Medicaid, we obviously put out our submission in. Realistically, I think we may win. We hold the majority of those, but there may be occasions when occasionally, Medicaid stake goes to the competition."

Now I'm really pleased that the responses been excellent, and our advisory boards and our speaker programs have been good acceptance. Whilst we have obviously a pan-genotypic label, I think the reality is that physicians are very, very comfortable, as our payers, with Harvoni for genotype 1. Obviously, that's a mix of 12-week treatments and 8-week. Just for your information, the 8-week cost of Harvoni is now 45% of patients treated in the United States. So I think people are just really comfortable with the clinical effect and the value proposition of Harvoni in GT1, which that all means that the slot that people see come Epclusa, is in the 2 and 3 patients. As I highlighted, it's something like an order of 20% to 25% of patients in the United States. I think the obvious advantage, both clinically and from a payer point of view, is you really do have a 12-week single-tablet regimen. You don't have to extend the treatment duration. You don't have to use ribavirin. There's quite a number of patients treated with Sovaldi, certainly, in the United States. So really, when somebody takes away that regimen, and it's an excellent slot looks. So we've had very good reception to Epclusa. It's extremely early days. It will take us 3 to 6 months to get payer approval. Physicians can apply based on medical need, and we know they're doing that. So just very early days and weeks.

We've got markets in different stages of development, whether it be U.S., parts of the U.S, different countries in Europe and, obviously, interesting profound dynamics in Japan. So that's partly made up of patient flows and partly made up of sort of payer flows. I think the big thing this quarter, from the point of view of the U.S., was very much of payer kind of mix with the large addition of patients from the VA. So I think the last 3 months, that was probably the biggest thing. We have not changed our prices in the U.S., Q2 versus Q1. It was largely, we're seeing this dramatic but incredibly successful program from VA."

Very little in terms of our commercial payer areas because the contracts are essentially you we are set up the end of last year for the full year. So very little change in market share within the commercial payer segments. We still have a very strong position in VA with Harvoni and Sovaldi, particularly Harvoni. I think, probably where we see increased competitive activity is in the Medicaid setting where, as I described have earlier, some of the smallest states are requesting contracts as they open up access. So I think that's probably where we see the competition and again, because of our very strong value proposition, we hope we can be successful in the majority of goals. But again, on occasions, we may find it very good to the competition."

I would like to contrast this with our own Atripla combination, SOF/VEL walks that John Milligan mentioned. We are looking essentially at 2 patient populations. One patient population is experience, that have previously failed other DAAs, treatment duration for 12 weeks. And then we're looking at all genotypes, Sovaldi in patients for 8-week treatment duration. And we have one study in particular that only looks at 8 weeks of treatment duration, the most difficult to treat genotype 3 Sovaldi patients  because that's still a population where SBR rates are still in the low 90s and [indiscernible] to the high 90s type of forward.

We are pleased to share results for the second quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin and John will then make a few comments. 
Total revenues for the second quarter was $7.8 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.08. This compares to revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter was $7.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, we saw an increase in HIV, U.S. HCV and other product sales that were offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe. 
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the second quarter were $4.9 billion, down 12% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2.3 billion, down 33% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates and discounts due primarily to payer mix and lower patient starts for Harvoni, as the initial group of warehouse patients was treated in 2015. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were up 13%, driven by a $270 million adjustment to our HCV sales returns reserve rate and the initial inventory build for Epclusa. Strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens drove 23% year-over-year and 11% sequential growth of our HIV product sales. The quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion were also positively impacted by the upward trajectory of Truvada used for PrEP.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and a higher proportion of patient starts from countries that have a lower net average price. Sequentially, sales in Europe were flat, excluding the impact of currency movements, with HIV sales growth offset by lower HCV sales. 
In Japan, product sales for the second quarter were $619 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of lower patient starts from Harvoni and the full quarter effect of the mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were discussed during our last call. 
Moving to gross margin. Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 92%, and benefited from the reversal of a $200 million litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016, following a favorable decision in the Merck case. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 48% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher and the progression of clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were up 10% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. From a balance sheet perspective, during the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion and ended the quarter with $24.6 billion in cash and investments. While our cash flows will remain strong in the second half of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q3 2016 due to required cash payments related to our current government rebates in the U.S. and abroad as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline progression. 
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares in April 2016 from the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program announced in February 2016. The total share repurchases in the first half of the year were $98.2 million at a cost of $90 billion. As previously communicated, we anticipate share repurchases in the second half of 2016 to be lower than the first half of 2016, as we focus our capital allocation on advancing our R&D opportunities. 
Finally, we are updating full year 2016 guidance, which is outlined on Slide 21. The changes are as follows: We are lowering net product sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. While we are seeing continued strength in non-HCV product sales, given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV, our updated models for just net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below $30 billion for the year. As such, we believe it is prudent to update our full year 2016 guidance. The factors contributing to this conclusion include: Lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segments in the U.S. and continued with a lower net average price in Europe, a trend towards slowing patient starts in the U.S. Commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe, the continued gradual trend towards shorter duration, and loss of some market share to competition. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including potential changes in the global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in our HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing commercial payer contract negotiations; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
We are increasing our R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, driven by acquisition-related expenses for Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher, slightly offset by lower-than-anticipated clinical trial expenses. 
We are lowering SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by the favorable onetime adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the Branded Prescription Drug fee, which lowered Q1 2016 SG&A expense. 
Diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related upfront collaboration, stock-based compensation and other expenses increases to a new range of $1.47 to $1.53 as a result of our recent M&A activity. All other components of our 2016 guidance remain unchanged. 
I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin."

Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity.

Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity. Working with exceptional executive colleagues around the table here in Foster City, interacting with my senior operating management team and seeing the dedication of the thousands of Gilead employees around the world leaves me in no doubt as to the long-term prospects for this outstanding company. 
Whilst early days, over the last 2 months in my new role, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Gilead's recent product introductions, the evolving health care landscape and the operating challenges on our near-term horizon. I'd like to share 3 general observations with you today. 
First, I am struck by the commitment that is shared by physicians, payers and governments around the world, to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C. Even countries with challenging economic circumstances are finding ways to prioritize the treatment of HCV patients. In the 2.5 years since the launch of Sovaldi, more than 1 million patients have been treated on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Beneath this aggregated number are several landmark statistics. The United States has already treated nearly 0.5 million patients to date with Sovaldi and Harvoni. Equally, over 200,000 patients in Europe have been treated with Gilead regimens. Japan has treated approximately 100,000 patients in a little over a year. And just this year, Australia has treated an estimated 17,000 patients in a matter of months. Health care systems have demonstrably mobilized to reach those patients most in need. These are remarkable facts that clearly underscore the profile of the products we have introduced. Equally, they have implications to longer-term treatment dynamics and portfolio life cycles. Secondly, in the area of HIV, I'm impressed by how the clinical data for TAF-based regimens are resonating with the many constituents who tirelessly drive for better patient care. The understanding that these regimens can help address a growing need for highly effective and safer treatment options for lifelong HIV therapy is evidenced by the early success of Genvoya. I will highlight some impressive data points later.
Thirdly, I'm reminded just how complex the delivery of health care continues to be. Gilead's focus on flawless execution, on controlling the variables that we can control with the highest levels of competent compliance is critical and is my top priority. 
Now let me take you through the details of the commercial performance for the second quarter. Starting with HCV. In the U.S., total HCV revenue is $2.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 33% year-over-year. Since the beginning of the year, access has improved and almost all major commercial payers have been moved by grocery store criteria, joining Medicare and the VA in this regard. Medicaid remains the only payer segment where I used to still generally restrict it to the sicker patients. There are other significant barriers to access, but we are encouraged that some states have recently moved away from fibrosis restrictions towards more open access.
In terms of patient starts, approximately 59,000 people began HCV therapy in the second quarter, and an estimated 90% of these patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Importantly, third-party databases suggest that new patients are being identified through increased screening efforts. As evidenced, approximately 14 million people were screened for HCV for the period of 2014 through 2015, and approximately 280,000 were confirmed RNA positive in that 2-year period. These figures represent a significant increase from the years prior to the launch of Sovaldi. We estimate that 3 million individuals remain infected with HCV in the U.S., approximately half of whom are diagnosed.
Although patient starts increased for the second consecutive quarter and patient inflows into care remained recently steady at around 30,000 patients a month, the dynamics vary by patient segments. 
Within the commercial and Medicare segments, some larger payers have recently opened up access. We now estimate that up to 90% of all commercial covered lives have access without regard to fibrosis score. While the payers that recently opened up access are bringing in more patients, we are seeing a modest downward trend in patient starts among payers that have had full access in place for longer periods of time. The sickest patients have largely been treated, and the movement we are seeing is towards treating genotype 1 patients with low fibrosis scores and thus greater use of the 8-week treatment regimen for Harvoni. 
In terms of all new HCV treatment starts in the second quarter, approximately 45% came from within the public payer systems. We anticipate this percentage will remain largely the same through the remainder of the year. The VA is one example of a payer within this segment, and their commitment to treating and curing veterans who have HCV using budget allocated by Congress to do so is truly groundbreaking. We are aware that in some cities, extra clinics have been scheduled to help shoulder the workload. However, we also expect that in the longer term, socially disadvantaged patients within the VA system will be harder to reach and bring into care and that the rate of treatment will decline.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $775 million, down 32% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Overall, Gilead patient starts decreased to around 28,000 for the quarter. We observed steady treatment rates in Italy and Spain, but lower numbers in early launch markets like Germany and France. Patient starts in the U.K. continue to be limited by NHS England budget restrictions. Additionally, we saw a slight decline in average treatment duration, as countries like Germany are treating more patients with low fibrosis scores, who qualify for an 8-week treatment duration.
In several European markets, locally documented cure rates are equal to, if not better than, what was demonstrated in Sovaldi and Harvoni clinical studies. This has resonated with governments and payer bodies, and some countries such as France are considering removing all fibrosis score criteria. We will watch this picture closely and share evolving news with you in the future. 
Moving to Japan. As Robin mentioned, revenue was $619 million, down 43% sequentially. We believe this was related to 2 factors: First, the decline in genotype 1 new patient starts following the Q1 2016 peak when a very large number of individuals with advanced disease initiated therapy; and second, the full treatment effect of a mandatory price reduction previously described on last quarter's call.
Finally, for HCV, Epclusa was recently approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada. These approvals are true milestones in patient care since Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic, once-daily, single-tablet option. Epclusa will be an important treatment option in the U.S. as an estimated 20% to 25% of HCV patients have genotypes 2 and 3. And equally, across Europe, there are some countries that have up to 30% of patients with genotype 3 alone. 
In concluding my remarks on hepatitis C, I will return to my earlier comments. Gilead is proud to be part of a fundamental disease paradigm shift, delivering disease cures to virtually all patients treated. That's why we developed Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa and have a third single-tablet regimen in clinical testing. 
Whilst the pace of new patient treatments may slow in coming years and quantifying that pace is incredibly hard, there is still an opportunity to identify and cure many HCV infected people around the globe. 
Moving to HIV. We are pleased with the launch of our TAF-based products in the U.S. and in the European markets where we have already achieved reimbursement. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.2 billion, up 11% sequentially, and Genvoya revenue nearly doubled in Q2 versus Q1. The product represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atripla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago. After its first 6 months of availability, Genvoya is already the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. 
78% of all Genvoya prescriptions have come from switches. Half of the switches have come from Stribild, and importantly, 10% of switches have come from non-Gilead therapies. Among all patients who switched, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product. 
Whilst still in the early stages of the Odefsey and Descovy launches, we are seeing similar patient dynamic to Genvoya. Over 90% of all Odefsey and Descovy prescriptions have come from switches. And 6% and 11% of switches, respectively, have come from non-Gilead therapies. 
Finally, in the U.S., I would like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP. We estimate somewhere in the order of 60,000 to 70,000 patients were using Truvada for PrEP in the second quarter. This number accounts for approximately 1/3 of Truvada demand. This is encouraging, as we know Truvada has an important role to play as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for many at-risk individuals.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $755 million, up 5% sequentially, driven by the launches of Genvoya and Descovy. Genvoya has gained pricing approval in 11 countries and is now the market leader in Germany for both treatment-naïve and switch patients after only 6 months of availability. We anticipate additional launches in France, Italy and the U.K. in the second half of the year. 
Genvoya is a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including Italy, where it was added before pricing and reimbursement. Preferred listings are anticipated in other EU guidelines later this year and into 2017. EACS guidelines are expected to be updated following the HIV Glasgow 2016 Conference in October.
Finally, I would like to briefly update you on the outstanding performance of the Gilead U.S. cardiovascular team. Letairis and Ranexa together generated $356 million in revenue during the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, over 0.25 million people in the United States regularly receive Ranexa. And Letairis remains the overall ERA market leader in PAH. 
In closing, Gilead achieved a great deal across our operations during the quarter, and I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in the second half of 2016. 
I would now like to turn the call over to John."

Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a",1165,"Thanks, Kevin. Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. 
Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments of my own. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made great progress in helping provide access to Sovaldi and Harvoni for HCV patients. Throughout the world, more than 1 million HCV sufferers have now been treated with nearly half of those coming from the U.S. A lot of these drugs were unprecedented in our industry, and patients were treated at a much faster initial rate than we, or anyone else, thought possible. Looking back, we can now say that in every country, the peak number of patients treated was achieved within 2 or 3 quarters of the launch of Harvoni. And that peak number is far higher than what we had -- what had ever been achieved before, about 3x that seen with the launch of the HCV protease inhibitors in 2011.
As we'd reached the mid-point of this year, we now see the market maturing to a slower rate of treatment for HCV-infected individuals. And as we think about this more normal patient starts, there are a few things to keep in mind. As Kevin mentioned, there are about 3 million people who are infected in the U.S., and slightly more than half of those have been diagnosed. Many of these diagnosed patients have less advanced liver disease upon reentering care. For example, in the United States in the second quarter this year, we estimated that only 13% of patients starting treatment had F4 fibrosis scores compared with more than 21% the year prior to that. With less severely ill patients, there is less urgency to immediately treat patients. This may explain the slower rate of treatment versus last year. However, we do believe these patients will eventually benefit from treatment, and this means the flow of patients will continue for many years to come.
There's also an opportunity to diagnose patients and bring them into care. As Kevin mentioned, we estimated that about 280,000 HCV patients were diagnosed in the U.S. within the last 2 years, showing the value and importance of the U.S. CDC and CMS recommendations for HCV testing. So while there has been a slowing of treatment compared with the rush of patients when Sovaldi and Harvoni were first approved, the HCV market is attractive over the longer term, providing good revenues, strong cash flow and earnings per share, on top of our base business of chronic therapies. 
Because of this, our focus on approving care for HCV and the affected individuals has not wavered. Beyond the recent approvals of Epclusa, we are actively working on a third single-tablet regimen that combines the 2 active ingredients in Epclusa with a third investigational compound, [indiscernible] telaprevir. This combination, known as SOF/VEL/VOX, is being evaluated at 4 Phase III clinical trials among patients who have previously failed direct acting antiviral treatments. It's also being studied for its potential to offer an 8-week treatment duration for treatment-naïve patients of all genotypes. We expect to have top line data available for SOF/VEL/VOX by the end of the year. 
We're making tremendous headway in HIV as well. Both of our portfolio of newer products and our pipeline. We've had several key approvals with Descovy approving the U.S. and Europe last quarter and Odefsey approved in Europe an earlier this month. It's clear these medications offer a significant advance for patients, and that advance has been recognized now by multiple professionals and public health groups, including the International Antiviral Society of the U.S.A. and the Department of Health and Human Services, both of which were released updated guidelines supporting the use of TAF-based regimens for initial HIV therapy. 
We continue to generate clinical data that support the favorable scientific and medical profile of our TAF-based products. Last week, we announced the results of 2 Phase IIIb switch studies, evaluating Odefsey in virologically suppressed adults switching from Complera or Atripla. Odefsey achieved similar rates of virological suppression as the TDF-based regimen. These studies reinforce the efficacy of Odefsey as well as the renal and bone safety advantages, and we plan to present full data sets later this year. 
Last month, we presented the first human data on bictegravir, our investigational, unlisted integration inhibitor, at the American Society for Microbiology. Data from 4 preclinical and Phase I studies examined the antiviral processes, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics and safety of bictegravir, providing the rationale to further evaluate the compound. Bictegravir as part of a single-tablet regimen, in combination with TAF and emtricitabine, is currently in Phase III trials. Enrollment of more than 2,300 patients across 4 registrational studies was completed earlier this month. The 48-week endpoints for this studies will be reached in the second quarter of next year, and if the data play out as we hope, NDA and MAA filings could occur in the third quarter of 2017.
With the approval and rapid adoption of our TAF-based regimens, an exciting new STR and Phase III development and an active HIV research pipeline, I'm confident that we will be able to extend our leadership position in the HIV market and broaden our ability to help even more patients around the world. 
Outside of our working antivirals, Gilead is focused on solving some of the biggest health challenges today. Several important data sets that are anticipated in the second half of this year may help us to find a strategy and pathway forward for tackling these challenges. In our NASH program, where we have 4 active clinical programs, we'll have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997, our ASK-1 inhibitor, and simtuzumab, our monoclonal antibody and LOXL2. The Phase II study of simtuzumab for primary sclerosing cholangitis will also conclude. We will also have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997 in diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. And finally, we expect data from 2 Phase III studies for myelofibrosis before the end of the year. If these data are positive, these studies will form the basis for an MDA filing in the first quarter of 2017. 
These are important milestones and represent a great deal of work across the organization to enroll and advance these studies and analyze complex data sets as they become available. Gilead continues to innovate at every level and every part of the organization. Next month, we will publish our first corporate social responsibility report that looks at access sustainability, graph making and other positive contributions to the communities we serve, and I urge you to read it. 
I'm proud of the work that's been led by our employees and extend my many thanks to them for all the ways they are making a difference around the world.

I'm not at all pessimistic about the long-term prospects for hepatitis C. In fact, I'm rather optimistic. I think what we have seen 2014, 2015 is an enormous group of the less well patients treated, particularly by specialists, hepatitis C treaters. It's really quite amazing. I think this quarter, we've highlighted perhaps going forward is really sort of a payer mix situation that we've got. The VA has definitely increased in terms of its contribution to the 59,000 total HCV starts, which, of course, was an increase on quarter 1. So a lot of VA patients are coming through, and the VA is very, very motivated to try to essentially eradicate the virus from that population. I think, yes, we did see a pickup in 2 of the large players that came on stream with open fibrosis scores from the beginning of the year, but we did see some downtick in other commercial payers. So net-net, it was slightly a decrease in overall commercial patients. What I feel about the long term and as we go into years further forward and we kind of hit an equilibrium of patients is all around what I mentioned, and John mentioned, around diagnoses. There's been a considerable pickup in the number of HCV tests, 2014, 2015, about a 65% increase in the number of HCV tests. 280,000 in that 2-year period were HCV RNA positive. So as John said, they will eventually work their way through treatment. But still over 1/4 of the population being diagnosed is at 4. So there's still a lot of sickness out there in patients. So whilst the health care system here and some of the European markets have done heroic things in treating patients in the last 2 years, I still think, with 1.5 million diagnosed patients in the United States that we are going to see a continued healthy flow of patients that can benefit from our products."

Historically, in this category after each market has peaked, it's begun a steady slow, sometimes slow, anyway, decline. We certainly saw a rapid decline after the protease inhibitors, more slow decline after we went to ribavirin and with the interaction of pegylated interferon. Are you suggesting to us that you think that there is a stable outlook for the HCV revenue on a market-by-market basis from these levels? Or are you suggesting that we should see more like an orderly and steady decline? And could you particularly comment about Europe, where I think it was surprising to see patient numbers in the big early markets roll over so quickly, particularly Germany and Japan? Is that a onetime step-down? Or are we going to continue at or below this level going forward?"

I think it is encouraging that patient starts in the U.S. and Europe have been recently steady over the past 3 quarters. Japan's a different story, and I can certainly, at some point, comment on that this afternoon. I think, from my perspective and Robin, Norbert, John around the table here, I think it's more of the latter comment that there will continue to be a gradual decline in new patient starts, but an equilibrium will be eventually hit. Quite the timing of that, Geoff, it's really, really, really hard to peg. I've just got to believe that with the amount of testing, with the amount of diagnoses with the CDC guidelines, Gilead itself in Q3, Q4 this year are going do some more educational programs around the need to test and treat that. We will eventually hit an equilibrium. In terms of Europe, Italy and Spain are very steady. I should tell you that in Italy there are still 200,000 quite sick individuals, people to be treated, and they're in treated care. And the Italian government do want to go ahead and try and mobilize providers to do that treating. So it's still an enormous number in Italy. I think the more -- the markets that are more akin to the U.S. like, first and foremost, Germany and to a slight lesser extent, France, are starting to see that sort of turnover of patients. We've got full access in terms of fibrosis score in Germany, and we're hoping, as I said, that we get broader access in France. The U.K. is a different situation, and that's largely due to payer restrictions. But again, still an enthusiasm to treat, but 1 or 2 of those markets, there is some maturing going on."

So we have, as you know, 2 compounds currently in clinical development. One is an active vaccine, 4779, the collaboration with GlobeImmune. That's currently in the later stages of being evaluated in non-suppressed state B patients. The suppressed state B patients, those data have been released, I think, maybe a year ago. That data did not show any activity, so we don't have high hopes that this compound will work. Then, the TLR7 agonist is that's just finishing the first cohort, which is in suppressed patients, and we are currently initiating -- the second cohort quarter is ongoing. We hope that we'll have the presentation of the first cohort ready by AASLD. Hopefully, we'll make that -- the abstract deadline. Then, you said that -- you asked the question about we had 2 other compounds in development. Well, you know what we're pursuing. Maybe I should answer this more generally. So we're pursuing 3 approaches to hepatitis B cure. So one is adding another different mechanism to the nucleosides because there's the observation that despite being undetectable with hepatitis B therapies like Viread or TAF, there was always a little bit of virus left, HBV there maybe takes about -- if you look at very sensitive PCR methods. So by adding another mechanism, so actually, we could completely suppress virus replication down to 0. Would that lead to an eventual cure or hepatitis S conversion? The second thing we're pursuing is immune therapy, so that belongs the vaccine and the TLR7 that I've talked about already. And we have a TLR8 agonist currently that is working its way towards an IND. And then the third possibility, that's the most hopeful but also the one that's least scientifically proven that's going directly after cccDNA, and that's really too early to talk about at this point.

I think it would be true to say that Medicaid's -- the states are slowly progressively opening up. 40% of Medicaid patients come from the 5 largest states. Two of those, New York and Florida, now have no fibrosis score. So as states do progressively consider opening up, they typically come to us for a contract.

Matt, first of all, there are 2 separate things that we're talking about here Q2 versus Q1. The first one, the interrupt [ph] Q2. We did have a sales return reserve adjustment really related to the fact that as we introduce our new hep C product, we're required to go out and get an external proxy related to sales return reserve. And just recently, just this past quarter, we closed several of the lots related to our products, which means that no further returns are accepted. So that gives us a triggering event by which we can look at returns versus how we had been accruing. The other key thing about the timing is just related to the Epclusa lot. So as we bring on a new product, we want to kind of want to rebase their level of returns that we expected to see. So that's really the adjustment there. For the most part, you could -- it's onetime in nature. We may have small adjustments going forward, but as long as returns continue where they are, then that $279 million is kind of a onetime event. Last quarter, we had a different issue, and that related to rebate claims for hepatitis C. And as I said on the call last time, we always have a situation where we're constantly truing up claims around HCV rebate because we get those claims 1 to 2 quarters in arrear. This quarter was a bit different than last quarters that we saw a modernization of the level of those claims relative to the prior quarter. So it wasn't -- it did reverse the other way. It was just a slowing of what we saw in Q1. So we're -- for lack of better word, so you're a little bit more caught up relative to returns this quarter than we were at the end of Q1.

Brian, the majority of the revenues in the second quarter, which is right to the end, the majority of that was inventory that Robin called out. So we've really only just begun the introduction, both the promotion and the education around Epclusa. I'm really pleased that the response has been excellent, and our advisory boards and our speaker programs have been good acceptance. Whilst we have obviously a pan-genotypic label, I think the reality is that physicians are very, very comfortable, as our payers with Harvoni for genotype 1. Obviously, that's a mix of 12-week treatments and 8-week. Just for your information, the 8-week cost of Harvoni is now 45% of patients treated in the United States. So I think people are just really comfortable with the clinical effect and the value proposition of Harvoni in GT1, which that all means that the slot that people see Epclusa is in the 2 and 3 patient. As I highlighted, it's something like in the order of 20% to 25% of patients in the United States. I think the obvious advantage, both clinically and from a payer point of view, is you really do have a 12-week single-tablet regimen. You don't have to extend the treatment duration. You don't have to use ribavirin. There's quite a number of patients treated with Sovaldi, Daclatasvir, certainly, in United States. So really, somewhat, it takes away that regimen, and it's an excellent slot. So we've had very good reception to Epclusa. It's extremely early days. It will take us 3 to 6 months to get payer approval. Physicians can apply based on medical need, and we know they're doing that, so just very early days and weeks. It seems to have found a very nice entry point."

There were also charges associated -- I should say expenses associated with the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher. So we're very pleased to get that onboard, and we look forward to explaining when we're going to use that. Above and beyond that, actually, R&D expenses were slightly down what we -- beneath what we have forecasted because we continue to hold the cost centers to -- accountable and continue to drive good value through our clinical teams in getting studies done at a very cost-effective way. So in terms of that, there's no difference. The SG&A line came down a little bit because of some onetime charges that were lower than we -- sorry, the IRS charges was lower than we anticipated, so kind of what we would expect.

And then we're looking at all genotypes, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients for 8-week treatment duration.

We are pleased to share results for the second quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin and John will then make a few comments. 
Total revenues for the second quarter were $7.8 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.08. This compares to revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $7.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, we saw an increase in HIV, U.S. HCV and other product sales that were offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe. 
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the second quarter were $4.9 billion, down 12% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2.3 billion, down 33% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates and discounts due primarily to payer mix and lower patient starts for Harvoni, as the initial group of warehouse patients was treated in 2015. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were up 13%, driven by a $270 million adjustment to our HCV sales returns reserves rate and the initial inventory build for Epclusa. Strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens drove 23% year-over-year and 11% sequential growth of our HIV product sales. The quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion were also positively impacted by the upward trajectory of Truvada used for PrEP.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and a higher proportion of patient starts from countries that have a lower net average price. Sequentially, sales in Europe were flat, excluding the impact of currency movements, with HIV sales growth offset by lower HCV sales. 
In Japan, product sales for the second quarter were $619 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of lower patient starts on Harvoni and the full quarter effect of the mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were discussed during our last call. 
Moving to gross margin. Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 92%, and benefited from the reversal of a $200 million litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016, following a favorable decision in the Merck case. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 48% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher and the progression of clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were up 10% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. 
From a balance sheet perspective, during the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion and ended the quarter with $24.6 billion in cash and investments. While our cash flows will remain strong in the second half of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q3 2016 due to required cash payments related to our current government rebates in the U.S. and abroad, as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline progression. 
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares in April 2016 from the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program announced in February 2016. The total share repurchases in the first half of the year were 98.2 million at a cost of $9 billion. As previously communicated, we anticipate share repurchases in the second half of 2016 to be lower than the first half of 2016, as we focus our capital allocation on advancing our R&D opportunities. 
Finally, we are updating full year 2016 guidance, which is outlined on Slide 21. The changes are as follows: We are lowering net product sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. While we are seeing continued strength in non-HCV product sales, given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV, our updated models for just net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below $30 billion for the year. As such, we believe it is prudent to update our full year 2016 guidance. 
The factors contributing to this conclusion include: Lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segments in the U.S. and companies with a lower net average price in Europe; a trend towards slowing patient starts in the U.S. Commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe; the continued gradual trends towards shorter duration and loss of some market share to competition. 
This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: potential changes in the global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in our HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing commercial payer contract negotiations; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
We are increasing our R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, driven by acquisition-related expenses for Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher, slightly offset by lower-than-anticipated clinical trial expenses. 
We are lowering SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by the favorable onetime adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the Branded Prescription Drug fee, which lowered Q1 2016 SG&A expense. 
Diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related upfront collaboration, stock-based compensation and other expenses increases to a new range of $1.47 to $1.53 as a result of our recent M&A activity. All other components of our 2016 guidance remain unchanged. 
I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin."

Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity. Working with exceptional executive colleagues around the table here in Foster City, interacting with my senior operating management team and seeing the dedication of the thousands of Gilead employees around the world leaves me in no doubt as to the long-term prospects for this outstanding company. 
Whilst early days, over the last 2 months in my new role, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Gilead's recent product introductions, the evolving health care landscape and the operating challenges on our near-term horizon. I'd like to share 3 general observations with you today. 
First, I am struck by the commitment that is shared by physicians, payers and governments around the world to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C. Even countries with challenging economic circumstances are finding ways to prioritize the treatment of HCV patients. 
In the 2.5 years since the launch of Sovaldi, more than 1 million patients have been treated on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Beneath this aggregated number are several landmark statistics. The United States has already treated nearly 0.5 million patients to date with Sovaldi and Harvoni. Equally, over 200,000 patients in Europe have been treated with Gilead regimens. Japan has treated approximately 100,000 patients in a little over a year. And just this year, Australia has treated an estimated 70,000 patients in a matter of months. Health care systems have demonstrably mobilized to reach those patients most in need. These are remarkable facts that clearly underscore the profile of the products we have introduced. Equally, they have implications to longer-term treatment dynamics and portfolio life cycles. 
Secondly, in the area of HIV, I'm impressed by how the clinical data for TAF-based regimens are resonating with the many constituents who tirelessly drive for better patient care. The understanding that these regimens can help address a growing need for highly effective and safer treatment options for lifelong HIV therapy is evidenced by the early success of Genvoya. I will highlight some impressive data points later.
Thirdly, I'm reminded just how complex the delivery of health care continues to be. Gilead's focus on flawless execution, on controlling the variables that we can control with the highest levels of conduct and compliance is critical and is my top priority. 
Now I'll get into the details of the commercial performance for the second quarter, starting with HCV. In the U.S., total HCV revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 33% year-over-year. Since the beginning of the year, access has improved and almost all major commercial payers have removed fibrosis score criteria, joining Medicare and the VA in this regard. Medicaid remains the only payer segment where use is still generally restrict it to the sicker patients. There are other significant barriers to access, but we are encouraged that some states have recently moved away from fibrosis restrictions towards more open access.
In terms of patient starts, approximately 59,000 people began HCV therapy in the second quarter, and an estimated 90% of these patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Importantly, third-party databases suggest that new patients are being identified through increased screening efforts. As evidenced, approximately 14 million people were screened for HCV for the period of 2014 through 2015, and approximately 280,000 were confirmed RNA positive in that 2-year period. These figures represent a significant increase from the years prior to the launch of Sovaldi. We estimate that 3 million individuals remain infected with HCV in the U.S., approximately half of whom are diagnosed.
Although patient starts increased for the second consecutive quarter and patient inflows into care remained recently steady at around 30,000 patients a month, the dynamics vary by patient segment. Within the commercial and Medicare segment, some larger payers have recently opened up access. We now estimate that up to 90% of all commercial covered lives have access without regard to fibrosis score. While the payers that recently opened up access are bringing in more patients, we are seeing a modest downward trend in patient starts among payers that have had full access in place for longer periods of time. The sickest patients have largely been treated, and the movement we are seeing is towards treating genotype 1 patients with lower fibrosis scores and thus greater use of the 8-week treatment regimen for Harvoni. 
In terms of all new HCV treatment starts in the second quarter, approximately 45% came from within the public payer systems. We anticipate this percentage will remain largely the same through the remainder of the year. The VA is one example of a payer within this segment, and their commitment to treating and curing veterans who have HCV using budget allocated by Congress to do so is truly groundbreaking. We are aware that in some cities, extra clinics have been scheduled to help shoulder the workload. However, we also expect that in the longer term, socially disadvantaged patients within the VA system will be harder to reach and bring into care and that the rate of treatment will decline.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $775 million, down 32% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Overall, Gilead patient starts decreased to around 28,000 for the quarter. We observed steady treatment rates in Italy and Spain, but lower numbers in early launch markets like Germany and France. Patient starts in the U.K. continue to be limited by NHS England budget restrictions. Additionally, we saw a slight decline in average treatment duration, as countries like Germany are treating more patients with low fibrosis scores, who qualify for an 8-week treatment duration.
In several European markets, locally documented cure rates are equal to, if not better than, what was demonstrated in Sovaldi and Harvoni clinical studies. This has resonated with governments and payer bodies. And some countries such as France are considering removing all fibrosis score criteria. We will watch this picture closely and share evolving news with you in the future. 
Moving to Japan. As Robin mentioned, revenue was $619 million, down 43% sequentially. We believe this was related to 2 factors: First, the decline in genotype 1 new patient starts following the Q1 2016 peak when a very large number of individuals with advanced disease initiated therapy; and second, the full 3-month effect of a mandatory price reduction previously described on last quarter's call.
Finally, for HCV, Epclusa was recently approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada. These approvals are true milestones in patient care since Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic, once-daily, single-tablet option. Epclusa will be an important treatment option in the U.S. as an estimated 20% to 25% of HCV patients have genotypes 2 and 3. And equally, across Europe, there are some countries that have up to 30% of patients with genotype 3 alone. 
In concluding my remarks on hepatitis C, I will return to my earlier comments. Gilead is proud to be part of a fundamental disease paradigm shift, delivering disease cures to virtually all patients treated. That's why we developed Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa and have a third single-tablet regimen in clinical testing. 
Whilst the pace of new patient treatment may slow in coming years and quantifying that pace is incredibly hard, there is still an opportunity to identify and cure many HCV infected people around the globe. 
Moving to HIV. We are pleased with the launch of our TAF-based products in the U.S. and in the European markets where we have already achieved reimbursement. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.2 billion, up 11% sequentially, and Genvoya revenue nearly doubled in Q2 versus Q1. The product represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atripla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago. After its first 6 months of availability, Genvoya is already the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. 
78% of all Genvoya prescriptions have come from switches. Half of the switches have come from Stribild, and importantly, 10% of switches have come from non-Gilead therapies. Among all patients who switched, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product. 
Whilst still in the early stages of the Odefsey and Descovy launches, we are seeing similar patient dynamic to Genvoya. Over 90% of all Odefsey and Descovy prescriptions have come from switches. And 6% and 11% of switches, respectively, have come from non-Gilead therapies. 
Finally, in the U.S., I would like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP. We estimate somewhere in the order of 60,000 to 70,000 patients were using Truvada for PrEP in the second quarter. This number accounts for approximately 1/3 of Truvada demand. This is encouraging, as we know Truvada has an important role to play as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for many at-risk individuals.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $755 million, up 5% sequentially, driven by the launches of Genvoya and Descovy. Genvoya has gained pricing approval in 11 countries and is now the market leader in Germany for both treatment-naïve and switch patients after only 6 months of availability. We anticipate additional launches in France, Italy and the U.K. in the second half of the year. 
Genvoya is the preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including Italy, where it was added before pricing and reimbursement. Preferred listings are anticipated in other EU guidelines later this year and into 2017. EACS guidelines are expected to be updated following the HIV Glasgow 2016 Conference in October.
Finally, I would like to briefly update you on the outstanding performance of the Gilead U.S. cardiovascular team. Letairis and Ranexa together generated $356 million in revenue during the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, over 0.25 million people in the United States regularly receive Ranexa. And Letairis remains the overall ERA market leader in PAH. 
In closing, Gilead achieved a great deal across our operations during the quarter, and I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in the second half of 2016. 
I would now like to turn the call over to John."
29002,369689622,1011623,"Gilead Sciences Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a",1165,"Thanks, Kevin. Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. 
Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments of my own. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made great progress in helping provide access to Sovaldi and Harvoni for HCV patients. Throughout the world, more than 1 million HCV sufferers have now been treated with nearly half of those coming from the U.S. While lots of these drugs were unprecedented in our industry, and patients were treated at a much faster initial rate than we, or anyone else, thought possible, looking back, we can now say that in every country, the peak number of patients treated was achieved within 2 or 3 quarters of the launch of Harvoni, but that peak number was far higher than what we had -- what had ever been achieved before; about 3x that seen with the launch of the HCV protease inhibitors in 2011.
As we've reached the mid-point of this year, we now see the market maturing to a slower rate of treatment for HCV-infected individuals. And as we think about this more normal patient starts, there are a few things to keep in mind. As Kevin mentioned, there are about 3 million people who are infected in the U.S., and slightly more than half of those have been diagnosed. Many of these diagnosed patients have less advanced liver disease upon reentering care. For example, in the United States in the second quarter this year, we estimated that only 13% of patients starting treatment had F4 fibrosis scores compared with more than 21% the year prior to that. With less severely ill patients, there is less urgency to immediately treat patients. And this may explain the slower rate of treatment versus last year. However, we do believe these patients will eventually benefit from treatment, and this means the flow of patients will continue for many years to come.
There's also an opportunity to diagnose patients and bring them into care. As Kevin mentioned, we estimated that about 280,000 HCV patients were diagnosed in the U.S. within the last 2 years, showing the value and importance of the U.S. CDC and CMS recommendations for HCV testing. So while there has been a slowing of treatment compared with the rush of patients when Sovaldi and Harvoni were first approved, the HCV market is attractive over the longer term, providing good revenues, strong cash flow and earnings per share, on top of our base business of chronic therapies. 
Because of this, our focus on improving care for HCV and infected individuals has not wavered. Beyond the recent approvals of Epclusa, we are actively working on a third single-tablet regimen that combines the 2 active ingredients in Epclusa with a third investigational compound, voxilaprevir . This combination, known as SOF/VEL/VOX, is being evaluated at 4 Phase III clinical trials among patients who have previously failed direct-acting antiviral treatments. It's also being studied for its potential to offer an 8-week treatment duration for treatment-naïve patients of all genotypes. We expect to have top line data available for SOF/VEL/VOX by the end of the year. 
We're making tremendous headway in HIV as well; both of our portfolio of newer products and our pipeline. We've had several key approvals with Descovy approved in the U.S. and Europe last quarter and Odefsey approved in Europe earlier this month. It's clear these medications offer a significant advance for patients, and that advance has been recognized now by multiple professionals and public health groups, including the International Antiviral Society of the U.S.A. and the Department of Health and Human Services, both of which were released updated guidelines supporting the use of TAF-based regimens for initial HIV therapy. 
We continue to generate clinical data that support the favorable scientific and medical profile of our TAF-based products. Last week, we announced the results of 2 Phase IIIb switch studies, evaluating Odefsey in virologically suppressed adults switching from Complera or Atripla. Odefsey achieved similar rates of virological suppression as the TDF-based regimens. These studies reinforce the efficacy of Odefsey as well as the renal and bone safety advantages, and we plan to present full data sets later this year. 
Last month, we presented the first human data on bictegravir, our investigational, unboosted integrase inhibitor, at the American Society for Microbiology. Data from 4 preclinical and Phase I studies examined the antiviral potency, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics and safety of bictegravir, providing the rationale to further evaluate the compound. Bictegravir, as part of a single-tablet regimen, in combination with TAF and emtricitabine, is currently in Phase III trials. Enrollment of more than 2,300 patients across 4 registrational studies was completed earlier this month. The 48-week endpoints for these studies will be reached in the second quarter of next year, and if the data play out as we hope, NDA and MAA filings could occur in the third quarter of 2017.
With the approval and rapid adoption of our TAF-based regimens, an exciting new STR and Phase III development and an active HIV research pipeline, I'm confident that we will be able to extend our leadership position in the HIV market and broaden our ability to help even more patients around the world. 
Outside of our working antivirals, Gilead is focused on solving some of the biggest health challenges today. Several important data sets that are anticipated in the second half of this year may help us to find a strategy and pathway forward for tackling these challenges. 
In our NASH program, where we have 4 active clinical programs, we'll have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997, our ASK-1 inhibitor, and simtuzumab, our monoclonal antibody against LOXL2. The Phase II study of simtuzumab for primary sclerosing cholangitis will also conclude. And we'll also have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997 in diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. And finally, we expect data from 2 Phase III studies for myelofibrosis before the end of the year. If these data are positive, these studies will form the basis for an MDA filing in the first quarter of 2017. 
These are important milestones and represent a great deal of work across the organization to enroll and advance these studies and analyze complex data sets as they become available. Gilead continues to innovate at every level and every part of the organization. Next month, we will publish our first corporate social responsibility report that looks at access, sustainability, grant making and other positive contributions to the communities we serve, and I urge each of you to read it.

I'm not at all pessimistic about the long-term prospects for hepatitis C. In fact, I'm rather optimistic. I think what we have seen 2014, 2015 is an enormous group of the less well patients treated, particularly by specialist hepatitis C treaters. It's really quite amazing. I think this quarter and we've highlighted perhaps going forward is really sort of a payer mix situation that we've got. The VA has definitely increased in terms of its contribution to the 59,000 total HCV starts, which, of course, was an increase on quarter 1. So a lot of VA patients are coming through, and the VA is very, very motivated to try to essentially eradicate the virus from that population. I think, yes, we did see pickup in 2 of the large players that came on stream with open fibrosis scores from the beginning of the year, but we did see some downtick in other commercial payers. So net-net, it was slightly a decrease in overall commercial patients. What I feel about the long term and as we go into years further forward and we kind of hit an equilibrium of patients is all around what I mentioned, and John mentioned, around diagnoses. There's been a considerable pickup in the number of HCV tests; 2014, 2015, about a 65% increase in the number of HCV tests. 280,000 in that 2-year period were HCV RNA positive. So as John said, they will eventually work their way through to treatment. But still over 1/4 of the population being diagnosed is at 4. So there's still a lot of sickness out there in patients. So whilst the health care system here and in some of the European markets have done heroic things in treating patients in the last 2 years, I still think, with 1.5 million diagnosed patients in the United States that we are going to see a continued healthy flow of patients that can benefit from our products."

Historically, in this category after each market has peaked, it's begun a steady slow, sometimes slow, anyway, decline. We certainly saw a rapid decline after the protease inhibitors, more slow decline after we went to ribavirin and with the introduction of pegylated interferon. Are you suggesting to us that you think that there is a stable outlook for the HCV revenue on a market-by-market basis from these levels? Or are you suggesting that we should see more like an orderly and steady decline? And could you particularly comment about Europe, where I think it was surprising to see patient numbers in the big early markets roll over so quickly, particularly Germany and Japan? Is that a onetime step-down? Or are we going to continue at or below this level going forward?"

I think it is encouraging that patient starts in the U.S. and Europe have been reasonably steady over the past 3 quarters. Japan's a different story, I can certainly, at some point, comment on that this afternoon. I think, from my perspective and Robin, Norbert, John around the table here, I think it's more of the latter comment; that there will continue to be a gradual decline in new patient starts, but an equilibrium will be eventually hit. Quite the timing of that, Geoff, it's really, really, really hard to peg. I've just got to believe that with the amount of testing, with the amount of diagnoses with the CDC guidelines, Gilead itself in Q3, Q4 of this year are going do some more educational programs around the need to test and treat that. We will eventually hit an equilibrium. In terms of Europe, Italy and Spain are very steady. I should tell you that in Italy, there are still 200,000 quite sick individuals, people to be treated, and they're in treated care. And the Italian government do want to go ahead and try and mobilize providers to do that treating. So it's still an enormous number in Italy. I think the more -- the markets that are more akin to the U.S., like, first and foremost, Germany and to a slightly lesser extent, France, are starting to see that sort of turnover of patients. We've got full access in terms of fibrosis score in Germany, and we're hoping, as I said, that we get broader access in France. The U.K. is a different situation, and that's largely due to payer restrictions. But again, still an enthusiasm to treat, but 1 or 2 of those markets, there is some maturing going on."

So we have, as you know, 2 compounds currently in clinical development. One is an active vaccine, 4779, the collaboration with GlobeImmune. That's currently in the later stages of being evaluated in non-suppressed hep B patients. The suppressed hep B patients, those data have been released, I think, maybe a year ago that they did not show any activity, so we don't have high hopes that the compound will work. Then, the TLR7 agonist is that's just finishing the first cohort, which is in suppressed patients, and we are currently initiating. The second cohort quarter is ongoing. We hope that we'll have the presentation of the first cohort ready by AASLD. Hopefully, we'll make that -- the abstract deadline. Then, you said that -- you asked the question about we had 2 other compounds in development. Well, you know what we're pursuing. Maybe I should answer this more generally. So we're pursuing 3 approaches to hepatitis B cure. The ne is adding another different mechanism to the nucleosides because there's the observation that despite being undetectable with hepatitis B therapies like Viread or TAF, there was always a little bit of virus left, HBV there may detectable if you look at very sensitive PCR methods. So by adding another mechanism, so actually, we could completely suppress virus replication down to 0, would that lead to an eventual cure or hepatitis S conversion? The second thing we're pursuing is immune therapy, so that belongs to the vaccine and the TLR7 that I've talked about already. And we have a TLR8 agonist currently that is working its way towards an IND. And then the third possibility, that's the most hopeful but also the one that's least scientifically proven that's going directly after cccDNA, and that's really too early to talk about at this point. It's still in the research stages."

As I said, all our public payers lumped together for the quarter were about 45%. That's an increase from the previous quarter, but as I said, that's all driven by VA. We've seen very little change, really, in our -- in the scale and size of our Medicaid business. I think it would be true to say that Medicaid's -- the states are slowly progressively opening up. 40% of Medicaid patients come from the 5 largest states. Two of those, New York and Florida, now have no fibrosis score. So as states do progressively consider opening up, they typically come to us for a contract. We think about those contracts very carefully. Depending on the size of Medicaid, we obviously put our submission in. Realistically, I think we may win, we hope, the majority of those, but there may be occasions when, occasionally, a Medicare -- Medicaid stake goes to the competition."

Matt, first of all, there are 2 separate things that we're talking about here Q2 versus Q1. First, let me address Q2. We did have a sales return reserve adjustment really related to the fact that as we introduce our new hep C product, we're required to go out and get an external proxy related to sales return reserves. And just recently, just this past quarter, we closed several of the lots related to our products, which means that no further returns are accepted. So that gives us a triggering event by which we can look at returns versus how we had been accruing. The other key thing about the timing is just related to the Epclusa lot. So as we bring on a new product, we want to kind of want to rebase the level of returns that we are expecting to see. So that's really the adjustment there. For the most part, you could -- it's onetime in nature. We may have small adjustments going forward, but as long as returns continue where they are, then that $279 million is kind of a onetime event. Last quarter, we had a different issue, and that related to the rebate claims for hepatitis C. And as I said on the call last time, we always have a situation where we're constantly truing up claims around HCV rebate because we get those claims 1 to 2 quarters in arrears. This quarter was a bit different than last quarters that we saw a modernization of the level of those claims relative to the prior quarter. So it wasn't -- it didn't reverse the other way. It was just a slowing of what we saw in Q1. So we're, for lack of better words, maybe a little bit more caught up relative to returns this quarter than we were at the end of Q1. So 2 different items, but we caught up at $279 million because that was the onetime event. So we ensured -- we wanted to ensure that you understood relative to the future projection of HCV sales."

Brian, the majority of the revenues in the second quarter, which is right at the end, the majority of that was inventory that Robin called out. So we've really only just begun the introduction, both the promotion and the education around Epclusa. I'm really pleased that the response has been excellent. In our advisory boards and our speaker programs there's been good acceptance. Whilst we have obviously a pan-genotypic label, I think the reality is that physicians are very, very comfortable, as are payers, with Harvoni for genotype 1. Obviously, there's a mix of 12-week treatments and 8-week. Just for your information, the 8-week course of Harvoni is now 45% of patients treated in the United States. So I think people are just really comfortable with the clinical effect and the value proposition of Harvoni in GT1, which therefore means that the slot that people see Epclusa is in the 2 and 3 patient. And as I highlighted, it's something like in the order of 20% to 25% of patients in the United States. I think the obvious advantage, both clinically and from a payer point of view, is you really do have a 12-week single-tablet regimen. You don't have to extend the treatment duration. You don't have to use ribavirin. There was quite a number of patients treated with Sovaldi, Daclatasvir, certainly, in United States. So really, in some ways, it takes away that regimen and is an excellent slot. So we've had very good reception to Epclusa. It's extremely early days. It'll take us 3 to 6 months to get payer approval. Physicians can apply based on medical need, and they're doing that. So just very early days and weeks. It seems to have found a very nice entry point."

It's our hope that as we exit this year, we'll have a better, more complete story of programs internally and externally that we can use to talk about why the long-term prospects for growth are as good as we believe they are, and that's what we'll be focused on."

What was the one thing you think that really changed your view over the last 3 months that led to that?"

Robyn, it's really hard. We've got markets in different stages of development, whether it be U.S., parts of the U.S., different countries in Europe and obviously, interesting and profound dynamics in Japan. So they're partly made up of patient flows and partly made up of sort of payer flows. I think the big thing this quarter, from the point of view of the U.S., was very much a payer kind of mix with the large addition of patients from the VA. So I think in the last 3 months, that was probably the biggest thing. We have not changed our prices in the U.S. Q2 versus Q1. It was largely we're seeing this dramatic but incredibly successful program from VA."

To your other part of your question and to what you were [ph] earlier throughout the call, this is a really difficult area to predict. It's unlike any other. It's a curative market, and it's very large relative to Gilead's total revenues. And so it's a question we're asking ourselves as we think in the outer years how can we continue or can we really guide around HCV revenues. So we've guided this year, but it's definitely something we're giving a lot of thought to as we kind of think about the trends of HCV going forward and all the dynamics that we're trying to deal with. It's very complex, so more to follow on that."

I think probably where we're seeing increased competitive activity is in the Medicaid setting where, as I described earlier, some of the smaller states are requesting contracts as they open up access.

However, what they're doing right now in Phase III is not looking at the 8-weak treatment duration or genotypes enrolled patients. I would like to contrast this with our own triple combination, SOF/VEL/VOX, that John Milligan mentioned. We are looking essentially at 2-patient population of 1-patient population's experience that had previously failed other DAAs, that treatment duration is for 12 weeks; and then we're looking at all genotypes, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients for 8-week treatment duration. And we had 1 study, in particular, that only looks at 8 weeks of treatment duration in the most difficult to treat genotype 3 cirrhotic patients because that's still a population where SVR rates are still in the low 90s. And if we could push that up into the high 90s, that would be a step forward. So I think our -- if our Phase III program, the data, support our Phase II results, then we will be a step ahead of all the competition."

So I think in the U.S., perhaps in Europe, it will be far more modest, the opportunity. Having said that, it depends where we are with those products, our products with where the competition is obviously, what we decide to do in terms of the pricing strategy. I think most importantly, from a company point of view, we think this is the right thing to do and probably the last step in the whole story around hepatitis C to help treatment experience of failure patients.

We are pleased to share results for the second quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin and John will then make a few comments. 
Total revenues for the second quarter were $7.8 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.08. This compares to revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $7.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, we saw an increase in HIV, U.S. HCV and other product sales that were offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe. 
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the second quarter were $4.9 billion, down 12% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2.3 billion, down 33% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates and discounts due primarily to payer mix and lower patient starts for Harvoni, as the initial group of warehouse patients was treated in 2015. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were up 13%, driven by a $270 million adjustment to our HCV sales returns reserves rate and the initial inventory build for Epclusa. Strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens drove 23% year-over-year and 11% sequential growth of our HIV product sales. The quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion were also positively impacted by the upward trajectory of Truvada used for PrEP.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and a higher proportion of patient starts from countries that have a lower net average price. Sequentially, sales in Europe were flat, excluding the impact of currency movements, with HIV sales growth offset by lower HCV sales. 
In Japan, product sales for the second quarter were $619 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of lower patient starts on Harvoni and the full quarter effect of the mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were discussed during our last call. 
Moving to gross margin. Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 92%, and benefited from the reversal of a $200 million litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016, following a favorable decision in the Merck case. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 48% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher and the progression of clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were up 10% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. 
From a balance sheet perspective, during the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion and ended the quarter with $24.6 billion in cash and investments. While our cash flows will remain strong in the second half of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q3 2016 due to required cash payments related to our current government rebates in the U.S. and abroad, as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline progression. 
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares in April 2016 from the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program announced in February 2016. The total share repurchases in the first half of the year were 98.2 million at a cost of $9 billion. As previously communicated, we anticipate share repurchases in the second half of 2016 to be lower than the first half of 2016, as we focus our capital allocation on advancing our R&D opportunities. 
Finally, we are updating full year 2016 guidance, which is outlined on Slide 21. The changes are as follows: We are lowering net product sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. While we are seeing continued strength in non-HCV product sales, given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV, our updated models for just net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below $30 billion for the year. As such, we believe it is prudent to update our full year 2016 guidance. 
The factors contributing to this conclusion include: Lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segments in the U.S. and companies with a lower net average price in Europe; a trend towards slowing patient starts in the U.S. Commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe; the continued gradual trends towards shorter duration and loss of some market share to competition. 
This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: potential changes in the global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in our HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing commercial payer contract negotiations; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
We are increasing our R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, driven by acquisition-related expenses for Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher, slightly offset by lower-than-anticipated clinical trial expenses. 
We are lowering SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by the favorable onetime adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the Branded Prescription Drug fee, which lowered Q1 2016 SG&A expense. 
Diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related upfront collaboration, stock-based compensation and other expenses increases to a new range of $1.47 to $1.53 as a result of our recent M&A activity. All other components of our 2016 guidance remain unchanged. 
I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin."

Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity. Working with exceptional executive colleagues around the table here in Foster City, interacting with my senior operating management team and seeing the dedication of the thousands of Gilead employees around the world leaves me in no doubt as to the long-term prospects for this outstanding company. 
Whilst early days, over the last 2 months in my new role, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Gilead's recent product introductions, the evolving health care landscape and the operating challenges on our near-term horizon. I'd like to share 3 general observations with you today. 
First, I am struck by the commitment that is shared by physicians, payers and governments around the world to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C. Even countries with challenging economic circumstances are finding ways to prioritize the treatment of HCV patients. 
In the 2.5 years since the launch of Sovaldi, more than 1 million patients have been treated on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Beneath this aggregated number are several landmark statistics. The United States has already treated nearly 0.5 million patients to date with Sovaldi and Harvoni. Equally, over 200,000 patients in Europe have been treated with Gilead regimens. Japan has treated approximately 100,000 patients in a little over a year. And just this year, Australia has treated an estimated 70,000 patients in a matter of months. Health care systems have demonstrably mobilized to reach those patients most in need. These are remarkable facts that clearly underscore the profile of the products we have introduced. Equally, they have implications to longer-term treatment dynamics and portfolio life cycles. 
Secondly, in the area of HIV, I'm impressed by how the clinical data for TAF-based regimens are resonating with the many constituents who tirelessly drive for better patient care. The understanding that these regimens can help address a growing need for highly effective and safer treatment options for lifelong HIV therapy is evidenced by the early success of Genvoya. I will highlight some impressive data points later.
Thirdly, I'm reminded just how complex the delivery of health care continues to be. Gilead's focus on flawless execution, on controlling the variables that we can control with the highest levels of conduct and compliance is critical and is my top priority. 
Now I'll get into the details of the commercial performance for the second quarter, starting with HCV. In the U.S., total HCV revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 33% year-over-year. Since the beginning of the year, access has improved and almost all major commercial payers have removed fibrosis score criteria, joining Medicare and the VA in this regard. Medicaid remains the only payer segment where use is still generally restrict it to the sicker patients. There are other significant barriers to access, but we are encouraged that some states have recently moved away from fibrosis restrictions towards more open access.
In terms of patient starts, approximately 59,000 people began HCV therapy in the second quarter, and an estimated 90% of these patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Importantly, third-party databases suggest that new patients are being identified through increased screening efforts. As evidenced, approximately 14 million people were screened for HCV for the period of 2014 through 2015, and approximately 280,000 were confirmed RNA positive in that 2-year period. These figures represent a significant increase from the years prior to the launch of Sovaldi. We estimate that 3 million individuals remain infected with HCV in the U.S., approximately half of whom are diagnosed.
Although patient starts increased for the second consecutive quarter and patient inflows into care remained recently steady at around 30,000 patients a month, the dynamics vary by patient segment. Within the commercial and Medicare segment, some larger payers have recently opened up access. We now estimate that up to 90% of all commercial covered lives have access without regard to fibrosis score. While the payers that recently opened up access are bringing in more patients, we are seeing a modest downward trend in patient starts among payers that have had full access in place for longer periods of time. The sickest patients have largely been treated, and the movement we are seeing is towards treating genotype 1 patients with lower fibrosis scores and thus greater use of the 8-week treatment regimen for Harvoni. 
In terms of all new HCV treatment starts in the second quarter, approximately 45% came from within the public payer systems. We anticipate this percentage will remain largely the same through the remainder of the year. The VA is one example of a payer within this segment, and their commitment to treating and curing veterans who have HCV using budget allocated by Congress to do so is truly groundbreaking. We are aware that in some cities, extra clinics have been scheduled to help shoulder the workload. However, we also expect that in the longer term, socially disadvantaged patients within the VA system will be harder to reach and bring into care and that the rate of treatment will decline.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $775 million, down 32% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Overall, Gilead patient starts decreased to around 28,000 for the quarter. We observed steady treatment rates in Italy and Spain, but lower numbers in early launch markets like Germany and France. Patient starts in the U.K. continue to be limited by NHS England budget restrictions. Additionally, we saw a slight decline in average treatment duration, as countries like Germany are treating more patients with low fibrosis scores, who qualify for an 8-week treatment duration.
In several European markets, locally documented cure rates are equal to, if not better than, what was demonstrated in Sovaldi and Harvoni clinical studies. This has resonated with governments and payer bodies. And some countries such as France are considering removing all fibrosis score criteria. We will watch this picture closely and share evolving news with you in the future. 
Moving to Japan. As Robin mentioned, revenue was $619 million, down 43% sequentially. We believe this was related to 2 factors: First, the decline in genotype 1 new patient starts following the Q1 2016 peak when a very large number of individuals with advanced disease initiated therapy; and second, the full 3-month effect of a mandatory price reduction previously described on last quarter's call.
Finally, for HCV, Epclusa was recently approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada. These approvals are true milestones in patient care since Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic, once-daily, single-tablet option. Epclusa will be an important treatment option in the U.S. as an estimated 20% to 25% of HCV patients have genotypes 2 and 3. And equally, across Europe, there are some countries that have up to 30% of patients with genotype 3 alone. 
In concluding my remarks on hepatitis C, I will return to my earlier comments. Gilead is proud to be part of a fundamental disease paradigm shift, delivering disease cures to virtually all patients treated. That's why we developed Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa and have a third single-tablet regimen in clinical testing. 
Whilst the pace of new patient treatment may slow in coming years and quantifying that pace is incredibly hard, there is still an opportunity to identify and cure many HCV infected people around the globe. 
Moving to HIV. We are pleased with the launch of our TAF-based products in the U.S. and in the European markets where we have already achieved reimbursement. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.2 billion, up 11% sequentially, and Genvoya revenue nearly doubled in Q2 versus Q1. The product represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atripla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago. After its first 6 months of availability, Genvoya is already the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. 
78% of all Genvoya prescriptions have come from switches. Half of the switches have come from Stribild, and importantly, 10% of switches have come from non-Gilead therapies. Among all patients who switched, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product. 
Whilst still in the early stages of the Odefsey and Descovy launches, we are seeing similar patient dynamic to Genvoya. Over 90% of all Odefsey and Descovy prescriptions have come from switches. And 6% and 11% of switches, respectively, have come from non-Gilead therapies. 
Finally, in the U.S., I would like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP. We estimate somewhere in the order of 60,000 to 70,000 patients were using Truvada for PrEP in the second quarter. This number accounts for approximately 1/3 of Truvada demand. This is encouraging, as we know Truvada has an important role to play as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for many at-risk individuals.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $755 million, up 5% sequentially, driven by the launches of Genvoya and Descovy. Genvoya has gained pricing approval in 11 countries and is now the market leader in Germany for both treatment-naïve and switch patients after only 6 months of availability. We anticipate additional launches in France, Italy and the U.K. in the second half of the year. 
Genvoya is the preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including Italy, where it was added before pricing and reimbursement. Preferred listings are anticipated in other EU guidelines later this year and into 2017. EACS guidelines are expected to be updated following the HIV Glasgow 2016 Conference in October.
Finally, I would like to briefly update you on the outstanding performance of the Gilead U.S. cardiovascular team. Letairis and Ranexa together generated $356 million in revenue during the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, over 0.25 million people in the United States regularly receive Ranexa. And Letairis remains the overall ERA market leader in PAH. 
In closing, Gilead achieved a great deal across our operations during the quarter, and I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in the second half of 2016. 
I would now like to turn the call over to John."

Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a",1165,"Thanks, Kevin. Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. 
Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments of my own. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made great progress in helping provide access to Sovaldi and Harvoni for HCV patients. Throughout the world, more than 1 million HCV sufferers have now been treated with nearly half of those coming from the U.S. While lots of these drugs were unprecedented in our industry, and patients were treated at a much faster initial rate than we, or anyone else, thought possible, looking back, we can now say that in every country, the peak number of patients treated was achieved within 2 or 3 quarters of the launch of Harvoni, but that peak number was far higher than what we had -- what had ever been achieved before; about 3x that seen with the launch of the HCV protease inhibitors in 2011.
As we've reached the mid-point of this year, we now see the market maturing to a slower rate of treatment for HCV-infected individuals. And as we think about this more normal patient starts, there are a few things to keep in mind. As Kevin mentioned, there are about 3 million people who are infected in the U.S., and slightly more than half of those have been diagnosed. Many of these diagnosed patients have less advanced liver disease upon reentering care. For example, in the United States in the second quarter this year, we estimated that only 13% of patients starting treatment had F4 fibrosis scores compared with more than 21% the year prior to that. With less severely ill patients, there is less urgency to immediately treat patients. And this may explain the slower rate of treatment versus last year. However, we do believe these patients will eventually benefit from treatment, and this means the flow of patients will continue for many years to come.
There's also an opportunity to diagnose patients and bring them into care. As Kevin mentioned, we estimated that about 280,000 HCV patients were diagnosed in the U.S. within the last 2 years, showing the value and importance of the U.S. CDC and CMS recommendations for HCV testing. So while there has been a slowing of treatment compared with the rush of patients when Sovaldi and Harvoni were first approved, the HCV market is attractive over the longer term, providing good revenues, strong cash flow and earnings per share, on top of our base business of chronic therapies. 
Because of this, our focus on improving care for HCV and infected individuals has not wavered. Beyond the recent approvals of Epclusa, we are actively working on a third single-tablet regimen that combines the 2 active ingredients in Epclusa with a third investigational compound, voxilaprevir . This combination, known as SOF/VEL/VOX, is being evaluated at 4 Phase III clinical trials among patients who have previously failed direct-acting antiviral treatments. It's also being studied for its potential to offer an 8-week treatment duration for treatment-naïve patients of all genotypes. We expect to have top line data available for SOF/VEL/VOX by the end of the year. 
We're making tremendous headway in HIV as well; both of our portfolio of newer products and our pipeline. We've had several key approvals with Descovy approved in the U.S. and Europe last quarter and Odefsey approved in Europe earlier this month. It's clear these medications offer a significant advance for patients, and that advance has been recognized now by multiple professionals and public health groups, including the International Antiviral Society of the U.S.A. and the Department of Health and Human Services, both of which were released updated guidelines supporting the use of TAF-based regimens for initial HIV therapy. 
We continue to generate clinical data that support the favorable scientific and medical profile of our TAF-based products. Last week, we announced the results of 2 Phase IIIb switch studies, evaluating Odefsey in virologically suppressed adults switching from Complera or Atripla. Odefsey achieved similar rates of virological suppression as the TDF-based regimens. These studies reinforce the efficacy of Odefsey as well as the renal and bone safety advantages, and we plan to present full data sets later this year. 
Last month, we presented the first human data on bictegravir, our investigational, unboosted integrase inhibitor, at the American Society for Microbiology. Data from 4 preclinical and Phase I studies examined the antiviral potency, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics and safety of bictegravir, providing the rationale to further evaluate the compound. Bictegravir, as part of a single-tablet regimen, in combination with TAF and emtricitabine, is currently in Phase III trials. Enrollment of more than 2,300 patients across 4 registrational studies was completed earlier this month. The 48-week endpoints for these studies will be reached in the second quarter of next year, and if the data play out as we hope, NDA and MAA filings could occur in the third quarter of 2017.
With the approval and rapid adoption of our TAF-based regimens, an exciting new STR and Phase III development and an active HIV research pipeline, I'm confident that we will be able to extend our leadership position in the HIV market and broaden our ability to help even more patients around the world. 
Outside of our working antivirals, Gilead is focused on solving some of the biggest health challenges today. Several important data sets that are anticipated in the second half of this year may help us to find a strategy and pathway forward for tackling these challenges. 
In our NASH program, where we have 4 active clinical programs, we'll have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997, our ASK-1 inhibitor, and simtuzumab, our monoclonal antibody against LOXL2. The Phase II study of simtuzumab for primary sclerosing cholangitis will also conclude. And we'll also have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997 in diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. And finally, we expect data from 2 Phase III studies for myelofibrosis before the end of the year. If these data are positive, these studies will form the basis for an MDA filing in the first quarter of 2017. 
These are important milestones and represent a great deal of work across the organization to enroll and advance these studies and analyze complex data sets as they become available. Gilead continues to innovate at every level and every part of the organization. Next month, we will publish our first corporate social responsibility report that looks at access, sustainability, grant making and other positive contributions to the communities we serve, and I urge each of you to read it. 
I'm proud of the work that's been led by our employees and extend my many thanks to them for all the ways they are making a difference around the world.

I'm not at all pessimistic about the long-term prospects for hepatitis C. In fact, I'm rather optimistic. I think what we have seen 2014, 2015 is an enormous group of the less well patients treated, particularly by specialist hepatitis C treaters. It's really quite amazing. I think this quarter and we've highlighted perhaps going forward is really sort of a payer mix situation that we've got. The VA has definitely increased in terms of its contribution to the 59,000 total HCV starts, which, of course, was an increase on quarter 1. So a lot of VA patients are coming through, and the VA is very, very motivated to try to essentially eradicate the virus from that population. I think, yes, we did see pickup in 2 of the large players that came on stream with open fibrosis scores from the beginning of the year, but we did see some downtick in other commercial payers. So net-net, it was slightly a decrease in overall commercial patients. What I feel about the long term and as we go into years further forward and we kind of hit an equilibrium of patients is all around what I mentioned, and John mentioned, around diagnoses. There's been a considerable pickup in the number of HCV tests; 2014, 2015, about a 65% increase in the number of HCV tests. 280,000 in that 2-year period were HCV RNA positive. So as John said, they will eventually work their way through to treatment. But still over 1/4 of the population being diagnosed is at 4. So there's still a lot of sickness out there in patients. So whilst the health care system here and in some of the European markets have done heroic things in treating patients in the last 2 years, I still think, with 1.5 million diagnosed patients in the United States that we are going to see a continued healthy flow of patients that can benefit from our products."

Historically, in this category after each market has peaked, it's begun a steady slow, sometimes slow, anyway, decline. We certainly saw a rapid decline after the protease inhibitors, more slow decline after we went to ribavirin and with the introduction of pegylated interferon. Are you suggesting to us that you think that there is a stable outlook for the HCV revenue on a market-by-market basis from these levels? Or are you suggesting that we should see more like an orderly and steady decline? And could you particularly comment about Europe, where I think it was surprising to see patient numbers in the big early markets roll over so quickly, particularly Germany and Japan? Is that a onetime step-down? Or are we going to continue at or below this level going forward?"

I think it is encouraging that patient starts in the U.S. and Europe have been reasonably steady over the past 3 quarters. Japan's a different story, I can certainly, at some point, comment on that this afternoon. I think, from my perspective and Robin, Norbert, John around the table here, I think it's more of the latter comment; that there will continue to be a gradual decline in new patient starts, but an equilibrium will be eventually hit. Quite the timing of that, Geoff, it's really, really, really hard to peg. I've just got to believe that with the amount of testing, with the amount of diagnoses with the CDC guidelines, Gilead itself in Q3, Q4 of this year are going do some more educational programs around the need to test and treat that. We will eventually hit an equilibrium. In terms of Europe, Italy and Spain are very steady. I should tell you that in Italy, there are still 200,000 quite sick individuals, people to be treated, and they're in treated care. And the Italian government do want to go ahead and try and mobilize providers to do that treating. So it's still an enormous number in Italy. I think the more -- the markets that are more akin to the U.S., like, first and foremost, Germany and to a slightly lesser extent, France, are starting to see that sort of turnover of patients. We've got full access in terms of fibrosis score in Germany, and we're hoping, as I said, that we get broader access in France. The U.K. is a different situation, and that's largely due to payer restrictions. But again, still an enthusiasm to treat, but 1 or 2 of those markets, there is some maturing going on."

That's currently in the later stages of being evaluated in non-suppressed hep B patients.

Then, the TLR7 agonist is that's just finishing the first cohort, which is in suppressed patients, and we are currently initiating. The second cohort quarter is ongoing. We hope that we'll have the presentation of the first cohort ready by AASLD. Hopefully, we'll make that -- the abstract deadline. Then, you said that -- you asked the question about we had 2 other compounds in development. Well, you know what we're pursuing. Maybe I should answer this more generally. So we're pursuing 3 approaches to hepatitis B cure. The one is adding another different mechanism to the nucleosides because there's the observation that despite being undetectable with hepatitis B therapies like Viread or TAF, there was always a little bit of virus left, HBV there may detectable if you look at very sensitive PCR methods. So by adding another mechanism, so actually, we could completely suppress virus replication down to 0, would that lead to an eventual cure or hepatitis S conversion? The second thing we're pursuing is immune therapy, so that belongs to the vaccine and the TLR7 that I've talked about already. And we have a TLR8 agonist currently that is working its way towards an IND. And then the third possibility, that's the most hopeful but also the one that's least scientifically proven that's going directly after cccDNA, and that's really too early to talk about at this point. It's still in the research stages."

As I said, all our public payers lumped together for the quarter were about 45%. That's an increase from the previous quarter, but as I said, that's all driven by VA. We've seen very little change, really, in our -- in the scale and size of our Medicaid business. I think it would be true to say that Medicaid's -- the states are slowly progressively opening up. 40% of Medicaid patients come from the 5 largest states. Two of those, New York and Florida, now have no fibrosis score. So as states do progressively consider opening up, they typically come to us for a contract. We think about those contracts very carefully. Depending on the size of Medicaid, we obviously put our submission in. Realistically, I think we may win, we hope, the majority of those, but there may be occasions when, occasionally, a Medicare -- Medicaid stake goes to the competition."

Matt, first of all, there are 2 separate things that we're talking about here Q2 versus Q1. First, let me address Q2. We did have a sales return reserve adjustment really related to the fact that as we introduce our new hep C product, we're required to go out and get an external proxy related to sales return reserves. And just recently, just this past quarter, we closed several of the lots related to our products, which means that no further returns are accepted. So that gives us a triggering event by which we can look at returns versus how we had been accruing. The other key thing about the timing is just related to the Epclusa lot. So as we bring on a new product, we want to kind of want to rebase the level of returns that we are expecting to see. So that's really the adjustment there. For the most part, you could -- it's onetime in nature. We may have small adjustments going forward, but as long as returns continue where they are, then that $279 million is kind of a onetime event. Last quarter, we had a different issue, and that related to the rebate claims for hepatitis C. And as I said on the call last time, we always have a situation where we're constantly truing up claims around HCV rebate because we get those claims 1 to 2 quarters in arrears. This quarter was a bit different than last quarters that we saw a modernization of the level of those claims relative to the prior quarter. So it wasn't -- it didn't reverse the other way. It was just a slowing of what we saw in Q1. So we're, for lack of better words, maybe a little bit more caught up relative to returns this quarter than we were at the end of Q1. So 2 different items, but we caught up at $279 million because that was the onetime event. So we ensured -- we wanted to ensure that you understood relative to the future projection of HCV sales."

Brian, the majority of the revenues in the second quarter, which is right at the end, the majority of that was inventory that Robin called out. So we've really only just begun the introduction, both the promotion and the education around Epclusa. I'm really pleased that the response has been excellent. In our advisory boards and our speaker programs there's been good acceptance. Whilst we have obviously a pan-genotypic label, I think the reality is that physicians are very, very comfortable, as are payers, with Harvoni for genotype 1. Obviously, there's a mix of 12-week treatments and 8-week. Just for your information, the 8-week course of Harvoni is now 45% of patients treated in the United States. So I think people are just really comfortable with the clinical effect and the value proposition of Harvoni in GT1, which therefore means that the slot that people see Epclusa is in the 2 and 3 patient. And as I highlighted, it's something like in the order of 20% to 25% of patients in the United States. I think the obvious advantage, both clinically and from a payer point of view, is you really do have a 12-week single-tablet regimen. You don't have to extend the treatment duration. You don't have to use ribavirin. There was quite a number of patients treated with Sovaldi, Daclatasvir, certainly, in United States. So really, in some ways, it takes away that regimen and is an excellent slot. So we've had very good reception to Epclusa. It's extremely early days. It'll take us 3 to 6 months to get payer approval. Physicians can apply based on medical need, and they're doing that. So just very early days and weeks. It seems to have found a very nice entry point."

So in terms of that, there's no difference. The SG&A line came down a little bit because of some onetime charges that were lower than we -- sorry, the IRS charge which was lower than we anticipated, so kind of what we would expect.

So I think in the U.S., perhaps in Europe, it will be far more modest, the opportunity. Having said that, it depends where we are with those products, our products with where the competition is obviously, what we decide to do in terms of the pricing strategy. I think most importantly, from a company point of view, we think this is the right thing to do and probably the last step in the whole story around hepatitis C to help treatment experience of failure patients. So I think, first and foremost, we think this is the right thing to do for patients in need."

We are pleased to share results for the second quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin and John will then make a few comments. 
Total revenues for the second quarter were $7.8 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.08. This compares to revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15 for the same period last year. Product sales for the second quarter were $7.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, we saw an increase in HIV, U.S. HCV and other product sales that were offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe. 
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the second quarter were $4.9 billion, down 12% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2.3 billion, down 33% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates and discounts due primarily to payer mix and lower patient starts for Harvoni, as the initial group of warehouse patients was treated in 2015. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were up 13%, driven by a $270 million adjustment to our HCV sales returns reserves rate and the initial inventory build for Epclusa. Strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens drove 23% year-over-year and 11% sequential growth of our HIV product sales. The quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion were also positively impacted by the upward trajectory of Truvada used for PrEP.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and a higher proportion of patient starts from countries that have a lower net average price. Sequentially, sales in Europe were flat, excluding the impact of currency movements, with HIV sales growth offset by lower HCV sales. 
In Japan, product sales for the second quarter were $619 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of lower patient starts on Harvoni and the full quarter effect of the mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were discussed during our last call. 
Moving to gross margin. Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 92%, and benefited from the reversal of a $200 million litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016, following a favorable decision in the Merck case. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 48% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher and the progression of clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were up 10% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. 
From a balance sheet perspective, during the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion and ended the quarter with $24.6 billion in cash and investments. While our cash flows will remain strong in the second half of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q3 2016 due to required cash payments related to our current government rebates in the U.S. and abroad, as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline progression. 
We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares in April 2016 from the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program announced in February 2016. The total share repurchases in the first half of the year were 98.2 million at a cost of $9 billion. As previously communicated, we anticipate share repurchases in the second half of 2016 to be lower than the first half of 2016, as we focus our capital allocation on advancing our R&D opportunities. 
Finally, we are updating full year 2016 guidance, which is outlined on Slide 21. The changes are as follows: We are lowering net product sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. While we are seeing continued strength in non-HCV product sales, given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV, our updated models for just net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below $30 billion for the year. As such, we believe it is prudent to update our full year 2016 guidance. 
The factors contributing to this conclusion include: Lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segments in the U.S. and companies with a lower net average price in Europe; a trend towards slowing patient starts in the U.S. Commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe; the continued gradual trends towards shorter duration and loss of some market share to competition. 
This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: potential changes in the global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in our HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing commercial payer contract negotiations; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. 
We are increasing our R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, driven by acquisition-related expenses for Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher, slightly offset by lower-than-anticipated clinical trial expenses. 
We are lowering SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by the favorable onetime adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the Branded Prescription Drug fee, which lowered Q1 2016 SG&A expense. 
Diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related upfront collaboration, stock-based compensation and other expenses increases to a new range of $1.47 to $1.53 as a result of our recent M&A activity. All other components of our 2016 guidance remain unchanged. 
I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin."

Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity. Working with exceptional executive colleagues around the table here in Foster City, interacting with my senior operating management team and seeing the dedication of the thousands of Gilead employees around the world leaves me in no doubt as to the long-term prospects for this outstanding company. 
Whilst early days, over the last 2 months in my new role, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Gilead's recent product introductions, the evolving health care landscape and the operating challenges on our near-term horizon. I'd like to share 3 general observations with you today. 
First, I am struck by the commitment that is shared by physicians, payers and governments around the world to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C. Even countries with challenging economic circumstances are finding ways to prioritize the treatment of HCV patients. 
In the 2.5 years since the launch of Sovaldi, more than 1 million patients have been treated on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Beneath this aggregated number are several landmark statistics. The United States has already treated nearly 0.5 million patients to date with Sovaldi and Harvoni. Equally, over 200,000 patients in Europe have been treated with Gilead regimens. Japan has treated approximately 100,000 patients in a little over a year. And just this year, Australia has treated an estimated 70,000 patients in a matter of months. Health care systems have demonstrably mobilized to reach those patients most in need. These are remarkable facts that clearly underscore the profile of the products we have introduced. Equally, they have implications to longer-term treatment dynamics and portfolio life cycles. 
Secondly, in the area of HIV, I'm impressed by how the clinical data for TAF-based regimens are resonating with the many constituents who tirelessly drive for better patient care. The understanding that these regimens can help address a growing need for highly effective and safer treatment options for lifelong HIV therapy is evidenced by the early success of Genvoya. I will highlight some impressive data points later.
Thirdly, I'm reminded just how complex the delivery of health care continues to be. Gilead's focus on flawless execution, on controlling the variables that we can control with the highest levels of conduct and compliance is critical and is my top priority. 
Now I'll get into the details of the commercial performance for the second quarter, starting with HCV. In the U.S., total HCV revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 33% year-over-year. Since the beginning of the year, access has improved and almost all major commercial payers have removed fibrosis score criteria, joining Medicare and the VA in this regard. Medicaid remains the only payer segment where use is still generally restrict it to the sicker patients. There are other significant barriers to access, but we are encouraged that some states have recently moved away from fibrosis restrictions towards more open access.
In terms of patient starts, approximately 59,000 people began HCV therapy in the second quarter, and an estimated 90% of these patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Importantly, third-party databases suggest that new patients are being identified through increased screening efforts. As evidenced, approximately 14 million people were screened for HCV for the period of 2014 through 2015, and approximately 280,000 were confirmed RNA positive in that 2-year period. These figures represent a significant increase from the years prior to the launch of Sovaldi. We estimate that 3 million individuals remain infected with HCV in the U.S., approximately half of whom are diagnosed.
Although patient starts increased for the second consecutive quarter and patient inflows into care remained recently steady at around 30,000 patients a month, the dynamics vary by patient segment. Within the commercial and Medicare segment, some larger payers have recently opened up access. We now estimate that up to 90% of all commercial covered lives have access without regard to fibrosis score. While the payers that recently opened up access are bringing in more patients, we are seeing a modest downward trend in patient starts among payers that have had full access in place for longer periods of time. The sickest patients have largely been treated, and the movement we are seeing is towards treating genotype 1 patients with lower fibrosis scores and thus greater use of the 8-week treatment regimen for Harvoni. 
In terms of all new HCV treatment starts in the second quarter, approximately 45% came from within the public payer systems. We anticipate this percentage will remain largely the same through the remainder of the year. The VA is one example of a payer within this segment, and their commitment to treating and curing veterans who have HCV using budget allocated by Congress to do so is truly groundbreaking. We are aware that in some cities, extra clinics have been scheduled to help shoulder the workload. However, we also expect that in the longer term, socially disadvantaged patients within the VA system will be harder to reach and bring into care and that the rate of treatment will decline.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $775 million, down 32% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Overall, Gilead patient starts decreased to around 28,000 for the quarter. We observed steady treatment rates in Italy and Spain, but lower numbers in early launch markets like Germany and France. Patient starts in the U.K. continue to be limited by NHS England budget restrictions. Additionally, we saw a slight decline in average treatment duration, as countries like Germany are treating more patients with low fibrosis scores, who qualify for an 8-week treatment duration.
In several European markets, locally documented cure rates are equal to, if not better than, what was demonstrated in Sovaldi and Harvoni clinical studies. This has resonated with governments and payer bodies. And some countries such as France are considering removing all fibrosis score criteria. We will watch this picture closely and share evolving news with you in the future. 
Moving to Japan. As Robin mentioned, revenue was $619 million, down 43% sequentially. We believe this was related to 2 factors: First, the decline in genotype 1 new patient starts following the Q1 2016 peak when a very large number of individuals with advanced disease initiated therapy; and second, the full 3-month effect of a mandatory price reduction previously described on last quarter's call.
Finally, for HCV, Epclusa was recently approved in the U.S., the EU and Canada. These approvals are true milestones in patient care since Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic, once-daily, single-tablet option. Epclusa will be an important treatment option in the U.S. as an estimated 20% to 25% of HCV patients have genotypes 2 and 3. And equally, across Europe, there are some countries that have up to 30% of patients with genotype 3 alone. 
In concluding my remarks on hepatitis C, I will return to my earlier comments. Gilead is proud to be part of a fundamental disease paradigm shift, delivering disease cures to virtually all patients treated. That's why we developed Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa and have a third single-tablet regimen in clinical testing. 
Whilst the pace of new patient treatment may slow in coming years and quantifying that pace is incredibly hard, there is still an opportunity to identify and cure many HCV infected people around the globe. 
Moving to HIV. We are pleased with the launch of our TAF-based products in the U.S. and in the European markets where we have already achieved reimbursement. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.2 billion, up 11% sequentially, and Genvoya revenue nearly doubled in Q2 versus Q1. The product represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atripla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago. After its first 6 months of availability, Genvoya is already the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. 
78% of all Genvoya prescriptions have come from switches. Half of the switches have come from Stribild, and importantly, 10% of switches have come from non-Gilead therapies. Among all patients who switched, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product. 
Whilst still in the early stages of the Odefsey and Descovy launches, we are seeing similar patient dynamic to Genvoya. Over 90% of all Odefsey and Descovy prescriptions have come from switches. And 6% and 11% of switches, respectively, have come from non-Gilead therapies. 
Finally, in the U.S., I would like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP. We estimate somewhere in the order of 60,000 to 70,000 patients were using Truvada for PrEP in the second quarter. This number accounts for approximately 1/3 of Truvada demand. This is encouraging, as we know Truvada has an important role to play as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for many at-risk individuals.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $755 million, up 5% sequentially, driven by the launches of Genvoya and Descovy. Genvoya has gained pricing approval in 11 countries and is now the market leader in Germany for both treatment-naïve and switch patients after only 6 months of availability. We anticipate additional launches in France, Italy and the U.K. in the second half of the year. 
Genvoya is the preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including Italy, where it was added before pricing and reimbursement. Preferred listings are anticipated in other EU guidelines later this year and into 2017. EACS guidelines are expected to be updated following the HIV Glasgow 2016 Conference in October.
Finally, I would like to briefly update you on the outstanding performance of the Gilead U.S. cardiovascular team. Letairis and Ranexa together generated $356 million in revenue during the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, over 0.25 million people in the United States regularly receive Ranexa. And Letairis remains the overall ERA market leader in PAH. 
In closing, Gilead achieved a great deal across our operations during the quarter, and I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in the second half of 2016. 
I would now like to turn the call over to John."

Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead full team -- full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. 
Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments of my own. Over the last 2.5 years, we've made great progress in helping provide access to Sovaldi and Harvoni for HCV patients. Throughout the world, more than 1 million HCV sufferers have now been treated with nearly half of those coming from the U.S. While lots of these drugs were unprecedented in our industry, and patients were treated at a much faster initial rate than we, or anyone else, thought possible, looking back, we can now say that in every country, the peak number of patients treated was achieved within 2 or 3 quarters of the launch of Harvoni, but that peak number was far higher than what we had -- what had ever been achieved before; about 3x that seen with the launch of the HCV protease inhibitors in 2011.
As we've reached the mid-point of this year, we now see the market maturing to a slower rate of treatment for HCV-infected individuals. And as we think about this more normal patient starts, there are a few things to keep in mind. As Kevin mentioned, there are about 3 million people who are infected in the U.S., and slightly more than half of those have been diagnosed. Many of these diagnosed patients have less advanced liver disease upon reentering care. For example, in the United States in the second quarter this year, we estimated that only 13% of patients starting treatment had F4 fibrosis scores compared with more than 21% the year prior to that. With less severely ill patients, there is less urgency to immediately treat patients. And this may explain the slower rate of treatment versus last year. However, we do believe these patients will eventually benefit from treatment, and this means the flow of patients will continue for many years to come.
There's also an opportunity to diagnose patients and bring them into care. As Kevin mentioned, we estimated that about 280,000 HCV patients were diagnosed in the U.S. within the last 2 years, showing the value and importance of the U.S. CDC and CMS recommendations for HCV testing. So while there has been a slowing of treatment compared with the rush of patients when Sovaldi and Harvoni were first approved, the HCV market is attractive over the longer term, providing good revenues, strong cash flow and earnings per share, on top of our base business of chronic therapies. 
Because of this, our focus on improving care for HCV and infected individuals has not wavered. Beyond the recent approvals of Epclusa, we are actively working on a third single-tablet regimen that combines the 2 active ingredients in Epclusa with a third investigational compound, voxilaprevir . This combination, known as SOF/VEL/VOX, is being evaluated at 4 Phase III clinical trials among patients who have previously failed direct-acting antiviral treatments. It's also being studied for its potential to offer an 8-week treatment duration for treatment-naïve patients of all genotypes. We expect to have top line data available for SOF/VEL/VOX by the end of the year. 
We're making tremendous headway in HIV as well; both of our portfolio of newer products and our pipeline. We've had several key approvals with Descovy approved in the U.S. and Europe last quarter and Odefsey approved in Europe earlier this month. It's clear these medications offer a significant advance for patients, and that advance has been recognized now by multiple professionals and public health groups, including the International Antiviral Society of the U.S.A. and the Department of Health and Human Services, both of which were released updated guidelines supporting the use of TAF-based regimens for initial HIV therapy. 
We continue to generate clinical data that support the favorable scientific and medical profile of our TAF-based products. Last week, we announced the results of 2 Phase IIIb switch studies, evaluating Odefsey in virologically suppressed adults switching from Complera or Atripla. Odefsey achieved similar rates of virological suppression as the TDF-based regimens. These studies reinforce the efficacy of Odefsey as well as the renal and bone safety advantages, and we plan to present full data sets later this year. 
Last month, we presented the first human data on bictegravir, our investigational, unboosted integrase inhibitor, at the American Society for Microbiology. Data from 4 preclinical and Phase I studies examined the antiviral potency, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics and safety of bictegravir, providing the rationale to further evaluate the compound. Bictegravir, as part of a single-tablet regimen, in combination with TAF and emtricitabine, is currently in Phase III trials. Enrollment of more than 2,300 patients across 4 registrational studies was completed earlier this month. The 48-week endpoints for these studies will be reached in the second quarter of next year, and if the data play out as we hope, NDA and MAA filings could occur in the third quarter of 2017.
With the approval and rapid adoption of our TAF-based regimens, an exciting new STR and Phase III development and an active HIV research pipeline, I'm confident that we will be able to extend our leadership position in the HIV market and broaden our ability to help even more patients around the world. 
Outside of our working antivirals, Gilead is focused on solving some of the biggest health challenges today. Several important data sets that are anticipated in the second half of this year may help us to find a strategy and pathway forward for tackling these challenges. 
In our NASH program, where we have 4 active clinical programs, we'll have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997, our ASK-1 inhibitor, and simtuzumab, our monoclonal antibody against LOXL2. The Phase II study of simtuzumab for primary sclerosing cholangitis will also conclude. And we'll also have data from the Phase II studies of GS-4997 in diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. And finally, we expect data from 2 Phase III studies for myelofibrosis before the end of the year. If these data are positive, these studies will form the basis for an MDA filing in the first quarter of 2017. 
These are important milestones and represent a great deal of work across the organization to enroll and advance these studies and analyze complex data sets as they become available. Gilead continues to innovate at every level and every part of the organization. Next month, we will publish our first corporate social responsibility report that looks at access, sustainability, grant making and other positive contributions to the communities we serve, and I urge each of you to read it. 
I'm proud of the work that's been led by our employees and extend my many thanks to them for all the ways they are making a difference around the world.

I'm not at all pessimistic about the long-term prospects for hepatitis C. In fact, I'm rather optimistic. I think what we have seen 2014, 2015 is an enormous group of the less well patients treated, particularly by specialist hepatitis C treaters. It's really quite amazing. I think this quarter and we've highlighted perhaps going forward is really sort of a payer mix situation that we've got. The VA has definitely increased in terms of its contribution to the 59,000 total HCV starts, which, of course, was an increase on quarter 1. So a lot of VA patients are coming through, and the VA is very, very motivated to try to essentially eradicate the virus from that population. I think, yes, we did see pickup in 2 of the large players that came on stream with open fibrosis scores from the beginning of the year, but we did see some downtick in other commercial payers. So net-net, it was slightly a decrease in overall commercial patients. What I feel about the long term and as we go into years further forward and we kind of hit an equilibrium of patients is all around what I mentioned, and John mentioned, around diagnoses. There's been a considerable pickup in the number of HCV tests; 2014, 2015, about a 65% increase in the number of HCV tests. 280,000 in that 2-year period were HCV RNA positive. So as John said, they will eventually work their way through to treatment. But still over 1/4 of the population being diagnosed is at 4. So there's still a lot of sickness out there in patients. So whilst the health care system here and in some of the European markets have done heroic things in treating patients in the last 2 years, I still think, with 1.5 million diagnosed patients in the United States that we are going to see a continued healthy flow of patients that can benefit from our products."

Historically, in this category after each market has peaked, it's begun a steady slow, sometimes slow, anyway, decline. We certainly saw a rapid decline after the protease inhibitors, more slow decline after we went to ribavirin and with the introduction of pegylated interferon. Are you suggesting to us that you think that there is a stable outlook for the HCV revenue on a market-by-market basis from these levels? Or are you suggesting that we should see more like an orderly and steady decline? And could you particularly comment about Europe, where I think it was surprising to see patient numbers in the big early markets roll over so quickly, particularly Germany and Japan? Is that a onetime step-down? Or are we going to continue at or below this level going forward?"

I think it is encouraging that patient starts in the U.S. and Europe have been reasonably steady over the past 3 quarters. Japan's a different story, I can certainly, at some point, comment on that this afternoon. I think, from my perspective and Robin, Norbert, John around the table here, I think it's more of the latter comment; that there will continue to be a gradual decline in new patient starts, but an equilibrium will be eventually hit. Quite the timing of that, Geoff, it's really, really, really hard to peg. I've just got to believe that with the amount of testing, with the amount of diagnoses with the CDC guidelines, Gilead itself in Q3, Q4 of this year are going do some more educational programs around the need to test and treat that. We will eventually hit an equilibrium. In terms of Europe, Italy and Spain are very steady. I should tell you that in Italy, there are still 200,000 quite sick individuals, people to be treated, and they're in treated care. And the Italian government do want to go ahead and try and mobilize providers to do that treating. So it's still an enormous number in Italy. I think the more -- the markets that are more akin to the U.S., like, first and foremost, Germany and to a slightly lesser extent, France, are starting to see that sort of turnover of patients. We've got full access in terms of fibrosis score in Germany, and we're hoping, as I said, that we get broader access in France. The U.K. is a different situation, and that's largely due to payer restrictions. But again, still an enthusiasm to treat, but 1 or 2 of those markets, there is some maturing going on."

So we have, as you know, 2 compounds currently in clinical development. One is an active vaccine, 4779, the collaboration with GlobeImmune. That's currently in the later stages of being evaluated in non-suppressed hep B patients. The suppressed hep B patients, those data have been released, I think, maybe a year ago that they did not show any activity, so we don't have high hopes that the compound will work. Then, the TLR7 agonist is that's just finishing the first cohort, which is in suppressed patients, and we are currently initiating. The second cohort quarter is ongoing. We hope that we'll have the presentation of the first cohort ready by AASLD. Hopefully, we'll make that -- the abstract deadline. Then, you said that -- you asked the question about we had 2 other compounds in development. Well, you know what we're pursuing. Maybe I should answer this more generally. So we're pursuing 3 approaches to hepatitis B cure. The one is adding another different mechanism to the nucleosides because there's the observation that despite being undetectable with hepatitis B therapies like Viread or TAF, there was always a little bit of virus left, HBV there may detectable if you look at very sensitive PCR methods. So by adding another mechanism, so actually, we could completely suppress virus replication down to 0, would that lead to an eventual cure or hepatitis S conversion? The second thing we're pursuing is immune therapy, so that belongs to the vaccine and the TLR7 that I've talked about already. And we have a TLR8 agonist currently that is working its way towards an IND. And then the third possibility, that's the most hopeful but also the one that's least scientifically proven that's going directly after cccDNA, and that's really too early to talk about at this point. It's still in the research stages."

We've seen very little change, really, in our -- in the scale and size of our Medicaid business. I think it would be true to say that Medicaid's -- the states are slowly progressively opening up. 40% of Medicaid patients come from the 5 largest states. Two of those, New York and Florida, now have no fibrosis score. So as states do progressively consider opening up, they typically come to us for a contract. We think about those contracts very carefully. Depending on the size of Medicaid, we obviously put our submission in. Realistically, I think we may win, we hope, the majority of those, but there may be occasions when, occasionally, a Medicare -- Medicaid stake goes to the competition."

Matt, first of all, there are 2 separate things that we're talking about here Q2 versus Q1. First, let me address Q2. We did have a sales return reserve adjustment really related to the fact that as we introduce our new hep C product, we're required to go out and get an external proxy related to sales return reserves. And just recently, just this past quarter, we closed several of the lots related to our products, which means that no further returns are accepted. So that gives us a triggering event by which we can look at returns versus how we had been accruing. The other key thing about the timing is just related to the Epclusa lot. So as we bring on a new product, we want to kind of want to rebase the level of returns that we are expecting to see. So that's really the adjustment there. For the most part, you could -- it's onetime in nature. We may have small adjustments going forward, but as long as returns continue where they are, then that $279 million is kind of a onetime event. Last quarter, we had a different issue, and that related to the rebate claims for hepatitis C. And as I said on the call last time, we always have a situation where we're constantly truing up claims around HCV rebate because we get those claims 1 to 2 quarters in arrears. This quarter was a bit different than last quarters that we saw a modernization of the level of those claims relative to the prior quarter. So it wasn't -- it didn't reverse the other way. It was just a slowing of what we saw in Q1. So we're, for lack of better words, maybe a little bit more caught up relative to returns this quarter than we were at the end of Q1. So 2 different items, but we caught up at $279 million because that was the onetime event. So we ensured -- we wanted to ensure that you understood relative to the future projection of HCV sales."

Brian, the majority of the revenues in the second quarter, which is right at the end, the majority of that was inventory that Robin called out. So we've really only just begun the introduction, both the promotion and the education around Epclusa. I'm really pleased that the response has been excellent. In our advisory boards and our speaker programs there's been good acceptance. Whilst we have obviously a pan-genotypic label, I think the reality is that physicians are very, very comfortable, as are payers, with Harvoni for genotype 1. Obviously, there's a mix of 12-week treatments and 8-week. Just for your information, the 8-week course of Harvoni is now 45% of patients treated in the United States. So I think people are just really comfortable with the clinical effect and the value proposition of Harvoni in GT1, which therefore means that the slot that people see Epclusa is in the 2 and 3 patient. And as I highlighted, it's something like in the order of 20% to 25% of patients in the United States. I think the obvious advantage, both clinically and from a payer point of view, is you really do have a 12-week single-tablet regimen. You don't have to extend the treatment duration. You don't have to use ribavirin. There was quite a number of patients treated with Sovaldi, Daclatasvir, certainly, in United States. So really, in some ways, it takes away that regimen and is an excellent slot. So we've had very good reception to Epclusa. It's extremely early days. It'll take us 3 to 6 months to get payer approval. Physicians can apply based on medical need, and they're doing that. So just very early days and weeks. It seems to have found a very nice entry point."

We've done some good deals both with Galapagos and Nimbus recently. We are very interested in continuing that to add more things to our pipeline, especially in the non-antiviral area where we continue to see growth in franchises.

So they're partly made up of patient flows and partly made up of sort of payer flows. I think the big thing this quarter, from the point of view of the U.S., was very much a payer kind of mix with the large addition of patients from the VA.

It's a curative market, and it's very large relative to Gilead's total revenues. And so it's a question we're asking ourselves as we think in the outer years how can we continue or can we really guide around HCV revenues. So we've guided this year, but it's definitely something we're giving a lot of thought to as we kind of think about the trends of HCV going forward and all the dynamics that we're trying to deal with.

I think probably where we're seeing increased competitive activity is in the Medicaid setting where, as I described earlier, some of the smaller states are requesting contracts as they open up access.

However, what they're doing right now in Phase III is not looking at the 8-weak treatment duration or genotypes enrolled patients. I would like to contrast this with our own triple combination, SOF/VEL/VOX, that John Milligan mentioned. We are looking essentially at 2-patient population of 1-patient population's experience that had previously failed other DAAs, that treatment duration is for 12 weeks; and then we're looking at all genotypes, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients for 8-week treatment duration. And we had 1 study, in particular, that only looks at 8 weeks of treatment duration in the most difficult to treat genotype 3 cirrhotic patients because that's still a population where SVR rates are still in the low 90s. And if we could push that up into the high 90s, that would be a step forward.

So I think in the U.S., perhaps in Europe, it will be far more modest, the opportunity. Having said that, it depends where we are with those products, our products with where the competition is obviously, what we decide to do in terms of the pricing strategy. I think most importantly, from a company point of view, we think this is the right thing to do and probably the last step in the whole story around hepatitis C to help treatment experience of failure patients.

We are pleased to share our results for the third quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin, Norbert and John will then make a few comments.
Total revenues for the third quarter were $7.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75. This compares to revenues of $8.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.22 for the same period last year.
Product sales for the third quarter were $7.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. These declines were due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, declines in our HCV sales in the U.S., Japan and Europe were partially offset by increases in U.S. HIV and other product sales.
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2 billion, down 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient, primarily due to a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments. The decline was partially offset by demand for Epclusa, which was launched at the end of Q2 2016 and generated $593 million in its first full quarter of sales.
Sequentially, our HCV product sales were down 12%. These sales were essentially flat compared to the second quarter, excluding the favorable adjustment to our HCV sales return of $279 million that we made last quarter. HIV and other anti-viral sales increased 32% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion were positively impacted by strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens and a onetime favorable adjustment of $332 million to our rebate reserves, primarily related to our TDF-based regimens. Without the adjustment, U.S. HIV and other anti-viral sales grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movements. Sequentially, sales were down 12%, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and summer seasonality, consistent with the usual decreases in demand during the European summer holiday months.
In Japan, product sales for the third quarter were $452 million, flat year-over-year, driven by higher sales of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, offset by mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which we discussed during our last call. Sequentially, sales were down 27% as a result of lower Harvoni and Sovaldi patient starts.
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $981 million for the third quarter, up 38% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the progression of our clinical studies, which included a $200 million milestone expense associated with our purchase of Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense.
From a balance sheet perspective, during the third quarter, we generated cash flows from operation of $4.3 billion and ended the quarter with $31.6 billion in cash and investments, which is inclusive of the issuance of $5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We have a healthy balance sheet to invest in our pipeline and external opportunities.  While our cash flows will remain strong, we do anticipate a sequential decrease in Q4 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline.
Shareholder return via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date remains strong. In the third quarter, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. For 2016, the total share repurchases through the third quarter were 110 million shares at a cost of $10 billion. Year-over-year, we have seen an 11% decline in our diluted shares, primarily driven by our share repurchases.
Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance, which was revised on July 25, 2016, and summarized on Slide 27 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measurement -- measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS [ph] , FFS, Medicaid and the VA.
I would like to turn the call over to Kevin now."

I am very pleased to take you through a solid set of operating results for the third quarter.
Starting with HIV. Gilead continues to make significant steps in delivering improved single-tablet regimens to patients around the world. We have seen strong adoption of our TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and in the European markets, where we have achieved reimbursement.
In the U.S., of the nearly 840,000 people on anti-retroviral therapy, approximately 80% received a Gilead regimen. Genvoya is now the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. This month, we expect cumulative prescriptions of Genvoya to surpass Atripla's prescription at the same point in time post approval. This will make Genvoya the all-time most successful product [ph] adoption in its first year in the 30-year history of HIV therapy in this country.
The uptake of Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy have largely been driven by the switch from Gilead's old STRs due to the improved safety profile of TAF. It is also encouraging to see a notable number of patients from non-Gilead therapies moving to TAF-based regimens. Approximately 10% of Genvoya switches are incremental to the Gilead HIV franchise.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other anti-viral revenue was $728 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Third quarter European pharmaceutical revenues are typically affected by summer seasonality. In Italy, Spain and Portugal, we saw lower prescribing rates consistent with prior years. Genvoya has been launched in 18 markets in the U.K. -- in the EU, including Spain and Germany, while we have seen rapid uptake similar to the U.S. Descovy has been launched in 9 markets, and Odefsey has been launched in 8 markets, the largest being Germany in both cases. We expect our TAF-based therapies to continue to grow in Europe with Spain still early in its commercial launch of Genvoya.  Pricing and reimbursement discussions are ongoing in France and Italy with the goal of having these complete by year-end.
Guidelines historically have had a significant impact on prescribing patterns [ph] . Genvoya is already listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including the European AIDS Clinical Society as well as country guidelines in Germany, the U.K., Spain and Italy.
I would like to make a few comments about HIV prevention and the use of Truvada for PrEP. The growth in people starting Truvada points to the valuable role that therapeutical can play when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent transmission. We estimate that in the U.S., approximately 80,000 to 90,000 people were using Truvada for this indication in the third quarter.  We are also starting to see usage of PrEP in France, where approximately 2,000 people have begun -- have been prescribed Truvada since it received reimbursement in January this year. We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead's growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S.
With the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens, the potential of PrEP and our exciting pipeline programs, especially bictegravir, I'm very positive about the long-term life cycle potential we have in HIV.
Turning to HCV. Approximately 61,000 people in total began HCV therapy in the U.S. in the third quarter 2016. This represents the fourth consecutive 3-month period where patient starts have been in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. We estimate that more than 85% of treated patients in the most recent quarter received a sofosbuvir-based regimen.
The uptake of Epclusa has been most encouraging in its first full quarter post launch, although it is important to point out that we have observed a small yet noticeable warehousing effect. As expected, the vast majority of Epclusa is being used in genotype 2 and 3 patients according to our 12-week label. In terms of payer coverage, formulary reviews for Epclusa are on track. 11-state Medicaid programs have already added Epclusa to genotype -- for genotype 2 and 3 patients, and most commercial and Medicare Part D plans are providing interim coverage for Epclusa based on medical need. Finally, the VA has added Epclusa to their national formulary and have begun ordering.
The 2017 commercial and Medicare Part D contracting cycle is now essentially complete. And whilst I cannot share with you plan-by-plan details, suffice to say that we are pleased with the picture for the coming year. Discussions with all major PBMs and MCOs prove to be productive and recognize the clinical leadership of Gilead's HCV options, especially as demonstrated in real-life settings.  But barriers to access still remain as Medicaid continues to be the outlier in terms of access, restricting coverage to only the more advanced patients.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the third quarter was $604 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 22% sequentially. This was driven by lower HCV patient starts. While overall patient starts declined, our market share remained largely unchanged across the major markets with the exception of the U.K., which was slightly down for the quarter.
We estimate that 21,000 patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the third quarter compared to 27,000 in the second quarter. At our last earnings, I described how we were observing lower patient starts in the early EU launch markets of Germany and France. Took simply, many of the high-need patients have been treated and cured. We are now starting to see this trend unfold in southern European countries, particularly in Italy and in Spain. Performance in the region is also likely somewhat affected by summer seasonality similar to the dynamics we observed in HIV.
Epclusa has now been launched in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. I'm pleased to say that there have been the same positive reception as in the U.S. We expect to launch in the other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017.
Not only does 12 weeks of Epclusa deliver incredibly high cure rates, but as a new standard of care, it is considerably cheaper than previously used interferon-free regimens, especially treating genotype 3.
As I conclude my remarks on hepatitis C, it is very important to reiterate that more work needs to be done to identify and cure HCV-infected people around the globe. A key objective for Gilead is to appropriately raise disease awareness, highlight the importance of age-related testing and encourage linkage to specialty care. To help with this effort, we recently launched new educational campaigns in the U.S. and Japan to urge all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider.
You may have seen our new advertisement on television here in the U.S. It debuted last week, and I am very pleased with the positive and responsible tone it takes to [ph] emphasize to people the need to be screened for a disease that can now be cured in as little as 8 weeks. We have received numerous positive comments from advocacy groups, providers and not least, the many people already cured of hepatitis C who want others like them to benefit.
Moving on. One of the liver disease that warrants a mention today is hepatitis B, for which we are well prepared for the launch of TAF. With our PDUFA date coming, we are hopeful that we will have the opportunity to speak to physicians at the AASLD meeting and in the field about the strong data for this product as soon as next week.
Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, we have a very strong U.S. cardiovascular team that continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenues totaled $385 million for the quarter and surpassed $1 billion in the year-to-date.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate the positive progress Gilead is making in addressing viral diseases. We will soon have treated 1.2 million HCV-infected individuals around the world, most of whom are now cured. By any measure, this is a profound contribution to global health care delivery.
And in the field of HIV, not only are we effectively managing the disease with our new TAF-based regimens, but Truvada is helping more and more people avoid infection. I am confident that we will close out the year with continued strong financial performance underpinned by a passion for operational excellence and our focus on putting the patient first.
I will now hand the call over to Norbert."

During the third quarter, a number of Phase II and Phase III studies concluded, providing insights into efficacy and safety of both approved and experimental Gilead [ph] in the areas of HIV, liver disease, inflammation, oncology and cardiovascular disease. Some of these results were disappointments. Some were exciting successes.
To start off with the disappointments. We now have the final analyses from 3 96-week studies of the anti-LOXL2 monoclonal antibody, simtuzumab. The data indicate that while safe and well tolerated, there is no evidence of efficacy in 1 study in primary sclerosing cholangitis and in 2 studies in NASH. One NASH study was in patients with cirrhosis, and one was in patients with bridging fibrosis. Consequently, we will not develop simtuzumab any further in these or any other indications. We will present this data at future conferences.
As for GS-5745, an anti-MMP9 antibody, we stopped a Phase II/III study in patients with ulcerative colitis because of a lack of efficacy. This decision followed a planned interim DSMB analysis after the first 150 patients had been enrolled and the study met predefined futility criteria. Also, and not unexpectedly, there was no evidence of benefit of GS-5745 in a Phase II study in patients with Crohn's disease. Consequently, we will not further pursue GS-5745 for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. In these studies, GS-5745 were safe and well tolerated, and we're continuing to evaluate GS-5745 in rheumatoid arthritis as an add on to anti-TNFs or other therapies.
Meclizine, or SG&A 6615, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a study of patients with ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or VTVF, and implanted cardioverter defibrillators. Patients were randomized to 2 doses of the meclizine or placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of electrical interventions, including shocks and pacing by the implanted device, and there was no evidence of efficacy of meclizine compared to placebo. Consequently, we will not develop meclizine any further for VTVF evaluation in long QT-3 syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is continuing. 
But now to the excitement. Starting with HCV. The pan-genotypic single-pill, triple-combination regimen of sofosbuvir, [indiscernible], or I'll call it [indiscernible], has been studied in 4 Phase IIb facilities for Polaris 1, 2, 3 and 4. Polaris 1 and 4 evaluated the regimen in patients with the fille direct acting antiviral and included patients with cirrhosis. Treatment of these salvage patients with soft [indiscernible] resulted in SVR rates of 96% and 97%. 
The 2 other studies, Polaris 2 and 3, compared the triple-combination regimen in treatment-naive patients given for 8 weeks to Epclusa given for 12 weeks. Polaris 2 was open to all genotypes, whereas Polaris 3 enrolled only genotype 3 infected individuals with compensated cirrhosis where the unmet need is the greatest. In Polaris 2, the SVR rate of 10 to 12 weeks of Epclusa were numerically higher than those obtained with 8 weeks of the triple combination, whereas in Polaris 3, the SVR rates were comparable. Particularly in Polaris 3, which involved the most difficult-to-treat genotype 3 infected cirrhotic patients, Epclusa for 12 weeks resulted in 96% SVR rate. These results underscore the value of Epclusa as an excellent treatment option for patients across all genotypes and also suggest that the future role of SOF/VEL DLX will be for patients who previously filled an antiviral regimen. The full data from these studies will be presented at ASOD in a few weeks, and we will submit Marketing Authorization Application to regulatory authorities imminently. 
Another exciting result was the anti-fibrotic effect observed with GS-4997 and investigational small molecule inhibitor of a proptosis signal regulating kinase 1 or S1. GS-4997 was a shown to inhibit inflammation a proptosis in fibrosis in settings of increased oxidative stress associated with NASH in preclinical models. This Phase II clinical study involved 72 patients. 2/3 had F-3 stage fibrosis and 1/3 had F2 stage fibrosis. There was evidence that treatment of GS-4997 for only 24 weeks resulted in fibrosis reversal and decreased fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest dose tested, which was 18 milligrams, 43% of patients showed at least a 1-point decrease in their fibrosis score compared to only 20% in the simtuzumab control arm. At the same time, 20% of the simtuzumab-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis compared to only 3% or 1 out of 30 at the 18-milligram dose. The full data from these studies will be presented at ASOD in a few weeks. 
Based on these exciting data, we will initiate discussions with regulatory authorities and plan to launch GS-4997 into Phase III clinical development in patients with NASH. Based on the Phase II results, we intend to evaluate GS-4997 in patients with the highest unmet need, that means those with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis. 
At the same time, we have 2 other compounds with different mechanisms currently in 2 Phase II studies in patients with NASH and fibrosis, and that is GS-9674, an FXR agonist; and GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor. And the studies or 24- and 12-week duration, respectively. Pending demonstration of single agent efficacy and safety in these 2 Phase II studies, we plan to initiate combination studies with 3 agents towards the middle of next year.
In HIV, we're continuing to explore the utility of TAF-containing regimens in various uses in different populations. Last week, data from 3 Phase III studies were presented at the HRV Conference in Glasgow. 96-week data were disclosed from 1 study or 663 biologically suppress patients were randomized to either continue to the TAF-based regimen or switch to a Descovy-based regimen. In 2 other studies, 630 and 875 are largely suppressed patients on COMPLERA and Atripla, respectively, were randomized to switch to Odefsey or stay on their current regimen. In all studies, switching to a TAF-based regimen was noninferior with regards to efficacy but were superior with regards to renal and bone laboratory safety parameters. 
The Phase III development of the single-tablet regimen of bictegravir F/TAF is continuing. Four Phase III studies for now fully enrolled, and we anticipate ublinding these studies towards the middle of next year with regulatory submissions plan for the third quarter of 2017. We also plan to present 48-week Phase II data on bictegravir F/TAF at the Scientific Meeting in the first quarter of 2017.
In oncology, a Phase III study of GS-5745 in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing as well as a Phase II study in patients with gastric cancer in combination with [indiscernible]. We're also evaluating GS-5745 in other solid tumors. 
In addition, we have now completed 2 Phase I safety studies of our combination kinase inhibitors. We were able to establish safe doses of our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, in combination with our BTK inhibitor, GS-4059, and our Syk inhibitor, [indiscernible], in combination with the BTK inhibitor, GS-4059. Consequently, we will now first evaluate the PI3K/BTK combination with and without anti-CD-20 therapy in relapsed/refractory CLL patients in collaboration with the CLL study group.
We will also be announcing initial Phase Ib/II data on our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in acute myeloid leukemia at the upcoming ASH Conference in San Diego. We've entered into a collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to provide entospletinib for their beat AML master trial. This trial will employ the latest genomic technology to match specific AML mutations in newly diagnosed patients over age of 60 with an appropriate investigational drug or drug combination.
In summary, great progress has been made with some of our programs. The very nature of R&D is that you often face foreclosures and progress. Going forward, I am pleased we now have the ability to focus our attention on development programs in NASH, inflammation oncology and HIV. We now have 7 new molecules in advanced clinical development. The PDUFA date for TAF for HPV is coming up in a few weeks, and we plan to file an NDA before the end of the year on SOF/VEL DLX for use as therapy for patients who have built a previous direct-acting antiviral. 
Four molecules are continuing in Phase III. That is momelotinib for myelofibrosis; dolutegravir F/TAF, the single-tablet regimen for HIV infection; [indiscernible] for 3 separate indication, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's; and GS-5745 in gastric cancer. 
Finally, we plan to advance GS-4997 for NASH to Phase III. 
I would now like to turn the call over to John."

We continue to have success with important work we're doing in HIV and hepatitis. There's still a great need for innovation in these deals. Both of these include patients whose needs remain unaddressed, and both represent global epidemics. 
Our researchers are working now options to wider range of patients than ever before. This includes people with HIV who've been on therapy for decades and may need to change their medication due to side effects or patients who may be failing to post suppressor balance due to the present resistance. 
Approaches our research teams are pursuing include new molecules from our system environments, now in formulations and combinations that we maybe those frequently and opportunities to care HIV patients by clearing of the viral reservoir from their bodies.
Our innovative work, in conjunction with our many partners, has already allowed us our [indiscernible] reach million of patients worldwide. Practically excited about the role that TAF will play. With a small daily dose and improved side effect profile, this ideal for resource string areas of the world empires only 1/10 of the manufacturing capacity to supply the same number of patient. 
In the area of viral hepatitis, the data now is Epclusa suggested we have an excellent option for the many parts of the developing world for genotypic HCV and the stage of disease could be difficult, if not impossible. With Epclusa, there's no difference in dosing for the different genotypes or is a liver disease, and so there's no need for these diagnostic procedures. We're working around the globe to rapidly introduce Epclusa as well as Sovaldi and Harvoni.
Finally, in hepatitis B, as Kevin and Norbert mentioned, we are approaching the launch of TAF. HCV continues to be an undertreated disease despite the long-term data showing improvement of liver for people who will remain unaffected therapy. TAF provides an important new option for patients with chronic HBV, and we'll have the opportunity to introduce the product at the liver meeting the next coming weeks in Boston. 
We also recognize that treating such a prevalent disease chronically is a major global challenge, and we continue to seek ways to provide finite durations of treatment such as the patient they control or eliminate the virus without having to endure a lifetime of treatment. Gilead's largest research effort is in the area of HPV care. 
Antivirals, we are making progress in your disease areas through Gilead. We are pleased to be able to share you today our top line data for GS-4997 and NASH. GS-4997 targets ASK1, a previously unexplored target for NASH. The data very suggests of the strong anti-fibrotic activity after only a 24-week period of treatment, and we look forward to future in-depth discussions once the data are presented at ASLD. 
We think about GS-4997 as a potential backbone molecule, one that can be used alone or in combination. NASH is an understudied but increasingly prevalent disease and Gilead's liver disease team now has 3 exciting molecule to move forward in the clinical studies. We understand that there's a lot of work to do in providing the rationale for the patient and to the payer after the benefits of treating NASH. An active compound such as GS-4997 could really move the deal forward, and we are in the process of designing comprehensive studies to demonstrate that health system benefits of treating such a prevalent and growing disease. 
In the area of inflammation, we're executing the build on plan. Phase III studies of the company been up and running and study is in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis have just begun screening patients in the first of these studies. I'm pleased with the progress we're making and we're our collaborators at the store up and running as quickly as possible. We're also looking forward to exploratory studies of about the name in a wider variety of inflammatory diseases that can fully understand the potential for this specific inhibitor. 
As you know, we are also focused on our augmenting our portfolio with external opportunities to take in the field of oncology. However, our interests in partnerships of potential acquisitions to not limited to oncology, and we are considering opportunities for strong science and where we see the possibility of developing a truly differentiated product.
We have going to extensive maternal programs and opportunities, and an important aspect of our approach is that we remain open-minded but disciplined. So while we have the balance sheet to execute a multi-opportunities, we will keep the bar high. 
With 2 months of the year remaining I want to take the opportunity to think the 9,000 employees of Gilead for their hard work and dedication. Everyday, more than 10 million individuals around the world take a Gilead medication, and everyday, our teams come to work to improve upon that number.

I've got to tell you that I think we're really executing well in the area of hepatitis C. I spent a lot of time this quarter with many Gilead's and with several providers. And I think the variables that we can directly influence, we're really doing a good job on. Our market share is staying incredibly strong. We're ensuring access whilst preserving the value of our hepatitis C drugs. And we're executing on new versions coming to the market. I think you've seen that with Epclusa. And the area that we can less control but we can influence, you're now seeing some new activities from us in terms of unbranded awareness campaigns. And you may have seen our advertisement that came on the television just over a week ago. So I think, from my point of view, in terms of operational excellence, we're doing a very nice job. It is true that the treatments are staying about the same. Actually, I've considered that very positive. Let's not forget that where treatment levels that are 2.5x the treatment levels that were there before, the Gilead regimens came to the market. So I take at the level of 50,000 to 60,000 patients as very good. The vast proportion of those are Gilead patients. Epclusa had a very big effect in this quarter. So it goes to show that there's still room for new patients, albeit we're entering a high level of satisfaction. But with Harvoni for genotype 1, both 12 weeks and now at high proportion of 8 weeks and now Epclusa for the 2 and 3 patients, yes, we have got patients being cured at very high levels. In terms of our triple, I do agree that could be a relatively small proportion of patients, but it's the right thing to do and it completes our whole picture for hepatitis C. So I think to have the range of products that we have, to have the efficacy that we have is the right offering for health care. So we continue to move forward, and I think we have a healthy franchise. And we are getting better access from, particularly the commercial payers, although, as I pointed out and I often discussed with the team here, the Medicaid is still a little bit on the slow side in terms of access. But great progress as far as I'm concerned in the third quarter."

I would say, from a pipeline perspective, with SOF/VEL/VOX being our fourth generation of HCV products now being approved, there really isn't much less in terms of unmatched medical need. And so from a pipeline perspective, this is really the end of what we will be developing in terms of HCV molecules, and that will allow us then to turn our attention to the important aspects in our fibrosis and NASH franchises and our oncology franchises. So we've really largely turned our attention away from HCV to those areas already."

And regarding the Phase III study, no, we are going to make the proposal to regulatory authorities to use just fibrosis as the endpoint. We feel very convinced that, that's the right thing to do because as you may now, fibrosis is the only histological correlate to clinical outcomes. There was a large study published a few years ago where they looked at baseline histology, and they correlated histological variables with clinical outcomes, and [indiscernible] didn't correlate, inflammation didn't correlate, ballooning didn't correlate. The only thing that correlated was fibrosis. So we are going to propose 2 Phase III studies both looking at fibrosis 48-week as the endpoint. The other thing we're going to do the studies in F3, F4 patients, again, the rationale is that, that's where the unmet need is. And also since ultimately, for full approval, you will need some clinical endpoint, we think we can get there much faster maybe with a 96-week study even if we start off with F4 patients. But having all of that said, this all has to be agreed upon by regulatory authorities. We have a date for the FDA, but we have not discussed this with them yet. So stay tuned. Sometime early next year, I think we can update you on the exact plan."

I mean, we really look at buybacks on a long-term perspective, which is pretty much what I committed or mentioned during the last quarter call. But we're still very comfortable where we are.

And we messaged [ph] very early on that we see those declines towards the second half of this year, very much aligned with John's comets around here for M&A. It's still fairly part of our capital allocation strategy, along with dividends. But I think balancing that with overall looking for growth is something that we're still focused on doing. And as John mentioned, these things take time to buy themselves out. I'll let Kevin answer the inventory question but I think your question of operating margin. Yes, but quarterization of our margins do get impacted by revenue dynamics as well as expenses. Keep in mind, R&D had a $200 million milestone payment this quarter included in that. But overall, our margins still remain high, high relative to overall industry. And we're comfortable with where we're very prudent with expense management use our SG&A spend is down. I think the other thing your slightly seeing is that mix changes between HCV and HIV. That has a little bit of an impact in our growth margin. But overall, with the continued conversion of TAF, long term, you'll continue to see that go down. But it will be impacted relative to HCV becoming a smaller component of our total revenue. I can't really give guidance on our gross margins, but I think at the Barstow remains high for them and we still remain a very disciplined pending type of organization."

So first, the U.S. If you look at our slide, actually, the percentage of F0s to F2s has increased over time. It was sort of 50% a little while ago, and now it's up to 60%. So clearly, fitter patients there, less sick of being as a result of coverage. But I want to say that the patient journey, I think, is becoming longer in the U.S. now. If you think about it, patients are really starting further back because they are healthier. We are continuing to see approximately 30,000 patients coming into specialty scare, so in other words, 90,000 patients a quarter. 60,000 of those are coming out to the other side and being treated and cured. That's probably not a bad ratio in itself. Not every patient is treated, and not every patient is immediately treated. Now we shouldn't forget that sometimes, patients drift in and out of a specialist's care. Some patients have compounding factors that complicates the start of therapy, most notably, drug use or alcohol use. And the patients who are just less sick have less motivation themselves, and the physician has less motivation to very push those therapy. And lastly, the paperwork and the administrative process for authorization is still there, likely within specialist products. So I think those are mostly the dynamics, and it's mostly around the patients being less time in the physician's practice. They're not patients that have been held for a long time. They are not patients that are failed 1 or 2 prior therapies and great urgency by the physician. In terms of Europe, as I said, we did see a downtick in the patients treated in the Southern European markets, primarily Italy and Spain. And I think that's because they are working through the sicker patients and are becoming more like France and Germany. There still are more patients in the Southern European markets, but I do think they are clearing -- do think they are clearing the most obvious patients to treat and cure. Now I would emphasize that market share is very, very solid in those markets. And whilst it's not an obvious mechanism through advertising, television advertising, in the European markets, we are doing a lot of partnership with KOLs, WITH societies, with patient groups to, again, try to encourage the right screening practices and the right transfer of patients into specialist's care."

It was still about 45% of patients who were covered as a public patient as opposed to a commercial or Medicare Part D plan. Part of the commercial part of the market is, of course, the VA. The VA was a little bit lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter. They still seem to be very enthusiastic, very engaged in recalling patients. But I think that's, perhaps, one of the variables that will kind of unfold in 2017 is the VA and their continuing ability to recall and treat patients.

I'll take the commercial first. They have gone well. I think, as I keep emphasizing, the advantage we have, the 8 weeks, we think about it, 45% right now of Harvoni patients, genotype 1 patients, are receiving 8 weeks. So if you think about 45% of genotype 1 with just 8 weeks, that's a very good economic offering for our payers that they really appreciate. So we've -- I believe we've done very well in our position going into 2017. In terms of the ratio between public and private, again, very difficult for me to make a prediction. VA did come down a little bit, but there was an increase, just a tick-up, to replace that by Medicaid. I made a comment that the Medicaid opening is really slower than we would like, but I think there may be that change in mix going forward. Difficult to predict VA. VA is still a big part of the public, and we'll just have to see. It's very impressive what they've done, and I know they're very committed. And they feel that they haven't done their job yet. We, and that's Gilead, we estimate that between 35% and 40% of the patients in the VA system have been treated to date. So there's still a lot of work to do, and I think they want to do it. So 45 -- 55 seems to have been the level for the last couple of quarters. And not entirely clear that, that's going to be maintained into 2017, but seems reasonable to me."

I was at our International Advisory Board a couple of weeks ago, and we had some of the foremost HIV doctors from around the world. And it was absolutely unanimous. The commitment to switching patients, all things being equal, particularly in terms of pricing, physicians see the benefit in terms of bone and kidney from the point the view of TAF. So I think there's an awful strong commitment. Let's not forget that in most practices now, half the patients are over the age of 50. And they've been on long-term therapy, and physicians just see a natural and fairly straightforward switch going on. I really didn't think I'd ever see on uptake quicker than Atripla. As you remember, there were the components of Atripla that could just be put together and the patients switched. These are slightly different with Genvoya because it's a switch of regimen. So I'm delighted with the way it's going. 80% of Genvoya comes from switches. And right now, half of those switches are from Stribild, which is the natural TAF to TDF to TAF switch. So my expectation is that we will continue to convert patients and [indiscernible] about it. And once we get more countries online in Europe, I think we can have that same expectation.

We are pleased to share our results for the third quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin, Norbert and John will then make a few comments.
Total revenues for the third quarter were $7.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75. This compares to revenues of $8.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.22 for the same period last year.
Product sales for the third quarter were $7.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. These declines were due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, declines in our HCV sales in the U.S., Japan and Europe were partially offset by increases in U.S. HIV and other product sales.
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2 billion, down 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient, primarily due to a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments. The decline was partially offset by demand for Epclusa, which was launched at the end of Q2 2016 and generated $593 million in its first full quarter of sales.
Sequentially, our HCV product sales were down 12%. These sales were essentially flat compared to the second quarter, excluding the favorable adjustment to our HCV sales return of $279 million that we made last quarter. HIV and other anti-viral sales increased 32% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion were positively impacted by strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens and a onetime favorable adjustment of $332 million to our rebate reserves, primarily related to our TDF-based regimens. Without the adjustment, U.S. HIV and other anti-viral sales grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movements. Sequentially, sales were down 12%, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and summer seasonality, consistent with the usual decreases in demand during the European summer holiday months.
In Japan, product sales for the third quarter were $452 million, flat year-over-year, driven by higher sales of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, offset by mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which we discussed during our last call. Sequentially, sales were down 27% as a result of lower Harvoni and Sovaldi patient starts.
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $981 million for the third quarter, up 38% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the progression of our clinical studies, which included a $200 million milestone expense associated with our purchase of Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense.
From a balance sheet perspective, during the third quarter, we generated cash flows from operation of $4.3 billion and ended the quarter with $31.6 billion in cash and investments, which is inclusive of the issuance of $5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We have a healthy balance sheet to invest in our pipeline and external opportunities.  While our cash flows will remain strong, we do anticipate a sequential decrease in Q4 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline.
Shareholder return via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date remains strong. In the third quarter, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. For 2016, the total share repurchases through the third quarter were 110 million shares at a cost of $10 billion. Year-over-year, we have seen an 11% decline in our diluted shares, primarily driven by our share repurchases.
Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance, which was revised on July 25, 2016, and summarized on Slide 27 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measurement -- measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA.
I would like to turn the call over to Kevin now."

I am very pleased to take you through a solid set of operating results for the third quarter.
Starting with HIV. Gilead continues to make significant steps in delivering improved single-tablet regimens to patients around the world. We have seen strong adoption of our TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and in the European markets, where we have achieved reimbursement.
In the U.S., of the nearly 840,000 people on anti-retroviral therapy, approximately 80% received a Gilead regimen. Genvoya is now the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. This month, we expect cumulative prescriptions of Genvoya to surpass Atripla's prescription at the same point in time post approval. This will make Genvoya the all-time most successful product adoption in its first year in the 30-year history of HIV therapy in this country.
The uptake of Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy have largely been driven by the switch from Gilead's old STRs due to the improved safety profile of TAF. It is also encouraging to see a notable number of patients from non-Gilead therapies moving to TAF-based regimens. Approximately 10% of Genvoya switches are incremental to the Gilead HIV franchise.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other anti-viral revenue was $728 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Third quarter European pharmaceutical revenues are typically affected by summer seasonality. In Italy, Spain and Portugal, we saw lower prescribing rates consistent with prior years. Genvoya has been launched in 18 markets in the U.K. -- in the EU, including Spain and Germany, while we have seen rapid uptake similar to the U.S. Descovy has been launched in 9 markets, and Odefsey has been launched in 8 markets, the largest being Germany in both cases. We expect our TAF-based therapies to continue to grow in Europe with Spain still early in its commercial launch of Genvoya.  Pricing and reimbursement discussions are ongoing in France and Italy with the goal of having these complete by year-end.
Guidelines historically have had a significant impact on prescribing patterns. Genvoya is already listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including the European AIDS Clinical Society as well as country guidelines in Germany, the U.K., Spain and Italy.
I would like to make a few comments about HIV prevention and the use of Truvada for PrEP. The growth in people starting Truvada points to the valuable role that therapy can play when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent transmission. We estimate that in the U.S., approximately 80,000 to 90,000 people were using Truvada for this indication in the third quarter.  We are also starting to see usage of PrEP in France, where approximately 2,000 people have begun -- have been prescribed Truvada since it received reimbursement in January this year. We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead's growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S.
With the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens, the potential of PrEP and our exciting pipeline programs, especially bictegravir, I'm very positive about the long-term life cycle potential we have in HIV.
Turning to HCV. Approximately 61,000 people in total began HCV therapy in the U.S. in the third quarter 2016. This represents the fourth consecutive 3-month period where patient starts have been in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. We estimate that more than 85% of treated patients in the most recent quarter received a sofosbuvir-based regimen.
The uptake of Epclusa has been most encouraging in its first full quarter post launch, although it is important to point out that we have observed a small yet noticeable warehousing effect. As expected, the vast majority of Epclusa is being used in genotype 2 and 3 patients according to our 12-week label. In terms of payer coverage, formulary reviews for Epclusa are on track. 11-state Medicaid programs have already added Epclusa to genotype -- for genotype 2 and 3 patients, and most commercial and Medicare Part D plans are providing interim coverage for Epclusa based on medical need. Finally, the VA has added Epclusa to their national formulary and have begun ordering.
The 2017 commercial and Medicare Part D contracting cycle is now essentially complete. And whilst I cannot share with you plan-by-plan details, suffice to say that we are pleased with the picture for the coming year. Discussions with all major PBMs and MCOs prove to be productive and recognize the clinical leadership of Gilead's HCV options, especially as demonstrated in real-life settings.  But barriers to access still remain as Medicaid continues to be the outlier in terms of access, restricting coverage to only the more advanced patients.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the third quarter was $604 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 22% sequentially. This was driven by lower HCV patient starts. While overall patient starts declined, our market share remained largely unchanged across the major markets with the exception of the U.K., which was slightly down for the quarter.
We estimate that 21,000 patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the third quarter compared to 27,000 in the second quarter. At our last earnings, I described how we were observing lower patient starts in the early EU launch markets of Germany and France. Took simply, many of the high-need patients have been treated and cured. We are now starting to see this trend unfold in southern European countries, particularly in Italy and in Spain. Performance in the region is also likely somewhat affected by summer seasonality similar to the dynamics we observed in HIV.
Epclusa has now been launched in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. I'm pleased to say that there have been the same positive reception as in the U.S. We expect to launch in the other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017.
Not only does 12 weeks of Epclusa deliver incredibly high cure rates, but as a new standard of care, it is considerably cheaper than previously used interferon-free regimens, especially treating genotype 3.
As I conclude my remarks on hepatitis C, it is very important to reiterate that more work needs to be done to identify and cure HCV-infected people around the globe. A key objective for Gilead is to appropriately raise disease awareness, highlight the importance of age-related testing and encourage linkage to specialty care. To help with this effort, we recently launched new educational campaigns in the U.S. and Japan to urge all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider.
You may have seen our new advertisement on television here in the U.S. It debuted last week, and I am very pleased with the positive and responsible tone it takes to emphasize to people the need to be screened for a disease that can now be cured in as little as 8 weeks. We have received numerous positive comments from advocacy groups, providers and not least, the many people already cured of hepatitis C who want others like them to benefit.
Moving on. One of the liver disease that warrants a mention today is hepatitis B, for which we are well prepared for the launch of TAF. With our PDUFA date coming, we are hopeful that we will have the opportunity to speak to physicians at the AASLD meeting and in the field about the strong data for this product as soon as next week.
Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, we have a very strong U.S. cardiovascular team that continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenues totaled $385 million for the quarter and surpassed $1 billion in the year-to-date.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate the positive progress Gilead is making in addressing viral diseases. We will soon have treated 1.2 million HCV-infected individuals around the world, most of whom are now cured. By any measure, this is a profound contribution to global health care delivery.
And in the field of HIV, not only are we effectively managing the disease with our new TAF-based regimens, but Truvada is helping more and more people avoid infection. I am confident that we will close out the year with continued strong financial performance underpinned by a passion for operational excellence and our focus on putting the patient first.
I will now hand the call over to Norbert."

During the third quarter, a number of Phase II and Phase III studies concluded, providing insights into efficacy and safety of both approved and experimental Gilead agents in the areas of HIV, liver disease, inflammation, oncology and cardiovascular disease. Some of these results were disappointments. Some were exciting successes.
To start off with the disappointments. We now have the final analyses from 3 96-week studies of the anti-LOXL2 monoclonal antibody, simtuzumab. The data indicate that while safe and well tolerated, there is no evidence of efficacy in 1 study in primary sclerosing cholangitis and in 2 studies in NASH. One NASH study was in patients with cirrhosis, and one was in patients with bridging fibrosis. Consequently, we will not develop simtuzumab any further in these or any other indications. We will present this data at future conferences.
As for GS-5745, an anti-MMP9 antibody, we stopped a Phase II/III study in patients with ulcerative colitis because of a lack of efficacy. This decision followed a planned interim DSMB analysis after the first 150 patients had been enrolled and the study met predefined futility criteria. Also, and not unexpectedly, there was no evidence of benefit of GS-5745 in a Phase II study in patients with Crohn's disease. Consequently, we will not further pursue GS-5745 for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. In these studies, GS-5745 were safe and well tolerated, and we're continuing to evaluate GS-5745 in rheumatoid arthritis as an add on to anti-TNFs or other therapies.
Eleclazine or GS-6615 failed to meet its primary endpoint in a study of patients with ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or VTVF and implanted cardioverter defibrillators. Patients were randomized to 2 doses of eleclazine or placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of electrical interventions, including shocks and pacing by the implanted device, and there was no evidence of efficacy of eleclazine compared to placebo. Consequently, we will not develop eleclazine any further for VTVF evaluation in long QT-3 syndrome and that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is continuing. 
But now to the excitement. Starting with HCV. The pan-genotypic single-pill, triple-combination regimen of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir or, I'll call it, SOF/VEL/VOX has been studied in 4 Phase III studies called POLARIS-1, -2, -3 and -4. POLARIS-1 and -4 evaluated the regimen in patients who have previously failed a direct acting antiviral and included patients with cirrhosis. Treatment of these salvage patients with SOF/VEL/VOX resulted in SVR rates of 96% and 97%.
The 2 other studies, POLARIS-2 and -3, compared the triple-combination regimen in treatment-naive patients given for 8 weeks to Epclusa given for 12 weeks. POLARIS-2 was open to all genotypes, whereas POLARIS-3 enrolled only genotype-3-infected individuals with compensated cirrhosis, where the unmet need is the greatest. In POLARIS-2, the SVR rates obtained with 10 to 12 weeks of Epclusa were numerically higher than those obtained with 8 weeks of the triple combination, whereas in POLARIS-3, the SVR rates were comparable.
Particularly in POLARIS-3, which involved the most difficult-to-treat genotype-3-infected cirrhotic patients, Epclusa for 12 weeks resulted in 96% SVR rate. These results underscore the value of Epclusa as an excellent treatment option for patients across all genotypes, and they also suggest that the future role of SOF/VEL/VOX will be for patients who previously failed an anti-viral regimen. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks, and we will submit Marketing Authorization Applications to regulatory authorities imminently.
Another exciting result was the anti-fibrotic effect observed with GS-4997, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 or ASK1. GS-4997 was a shown to inhibit inflammation apoptosis and fibrosis in settings of increased oxidative stress associated with NASH in preclinical models. This Phase II clinical study involved 72 patients. 2/3 had F3-stage fibrosis, and 1/3 had F2-stage fibrosis. There was evidence that treatment with GS-4997 for only 24 weeks resulted in fibrosis reversal and decreased fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest dose tested, which was 18 milligrams, 43% of patients showed at least a 1 point decrease in their fibrosis score compared to only 20% in the simtuzumab control arm. At the same time, 20% of the simtuzumab-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis compared to only 3% or 1 out of 30 at the 18-milligram dose. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks.
Based on these exciting data, we will initiate discussions with regulatory authorities and plan to move GS-4997 into Phase III clinical development in patients with NASH. Based on the Phase II results, we intend to evaluate GS-4997 in patients with the highest unmet need. That means those with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis.
At the same time, we have 2 other compounds with different mechanisms currently in 2 Phase II studies in patients with NASH and fibrosis, and that is GS-9674, an FXR agonist; and GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor. And the studies are of 24- and 12-week duration, respectively. Pending demonstration of single-agent efficacy and safety in these 2 Phase II studies, we plan to initiate combination studies with the 3 agents towards the middle of next year.
In HIV, we're continuing to explore the utility of TAF-containing regimens in various uses in different populations. Last week, data from 3 Phase III studies were presented at the HIV Conference in Glasgow. 96-week data were disclosed from 1 study where 663 biologically suppressed patients were randomized to either continue on their Truvada-based regimen or to switch to a Descovy-based regimen. In 2 other studies, 630 and 875 of largely suppressed patients on Complera and Atripla, respectively, were randomized to switch to Odefsey or stay on their current regimen. In all studies, switching to a TAF-based regimen was noninferior with regards to efficacy but were superior with regards to renal and bone laboratory safety parameters.
The Phase III development of the single-tablet regimen of bictegravir F/TAF is continuing. Four Phase III studies are now fully enrolled, and we anticipate unblinding these studies towards the middle of next year with regulatory submissions planned for the third quarter of 2017. We also plan to present 48-week Phase II data on bictegravir F/TAF at the Scientific Meeting in the first quarter of 2017.
In oncology, a Phase III study of GS-5745 in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing as well as a Phase II study in patients with gastric cancer in combination with nivolumab. We're also evaluating GS-5745 in other solid tumors.
In addition, we have now completed 2 Phase I safety studies of our combination kinase inhibitors. We were able to establish safe doses of our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, in combination with our BTK inhibitor, GS-4059, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with the BTK inhibitor, GS-4059. Consequently, we will now first evaluate the PI3K/BTK combination with and without anti-CD20 therapy in relapsed/refractory CLL patients in collaboration with the German CLL study group.
We will also be announcing initial Phase Ib/II data on our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in acute myeloid leukemia at the upcoming ASH Conference in San Diego. We've entered into a collaboration with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to provide entospletinib for their Beat AML Master Trial. This trial will employ the latest genomic technology to match specific AML mutations in newly diagnosed patients over age of 60 with an appropriate investigational drug or drug combination.
In summary, great progress has been made with some of our programs. The very nature of R&D is that you often face both closures and progress. Going forward, I'm pleased we now have the ability to focus our attention on development programs in NASH, inflammation oncology and HIV. We now have 7 new molecules in advanced clinical development. The PDUFA date for TAF for HBV is coming up in a few weeks, and we plan to file an NDA before the end of the year on SOF/VEL/VOX for use as salvage therapy for patients who have failed a previous direct acting antiviral. 
Four molecules are continuing in Phase III. That is momelotinib for myelofibrosis; bictegravir/F/TAF, the single-tablet regimen for HIV infection; filgotinib for 3 separate indication, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's; and GS-5745 in gastric cancer. Finally, we plan to advance GS-4997 for NASH to Phase III.
I would now like to turn the call over to John."

We continue to have success with the important work we do in HIV and viral hepatitis. There's still a great need for innovation in these deals. Both diseases include patients whose needs remain unaddressed, and both represent global epidemics.
Our researchers are working to bring new options to a wider range of patients than ever before. This includes people with HIV who've been on therapy for decades and may need to change their medication due to side effects or patients who may be failing to fully suppress their virus due to the presence of resistance.  Approaches our research teams are pursuing include new molecules for treating resistant virus now in formulations and combinations that may be dosed infrequently and opportunities to cure HIV patients by clearing out viral reservoir from their bodies.
Our innovative work, in conjunction with our many partners, has already allowed our HIV medicines to reach millions of patients worldwide. We're particularly excited about the role that TAF will play. With a small daily dose and improved side effect profile, it is ideal for resource-constrained areas of the world and requires only 1/10 of the manufacturing capacity to supply the same number of patients.
In the area of viral hepatitis, the data now obtained with Epclusa suggest that we have an excellent option for the many parts of the developing world for genotyping HCV in determining the stage of disease can be difficult, if not, impossible. With Epclusa, there's no difference in dosing for the different genotypes or stages of liver disease, and so there's no need for these diagnostic procedures. We're working around the globe to rapidly introduce Epclusa as well as Sovaldi and Harvoni.
Finally, in hepatitis B, as Kevin and Norbert mentioned, we are approaching the launch of TAF. HBV continues to be an under-treated disease despite the long-term data showing improvement of liver for people who remain on effective therapy. TAF provides an important new option for patients with chronic HBV, and we'll have the opportunity to introduce the product at the liver meeting in the next -- coming weeks at Boston.
We also recognize that treating such a prevalent disease chronically is a major global challenge, and we continue to seek ways to provide finite duration of treatment that the patients can control or eliminate the virus without having to endure a lifetime of treatment. Gilead's largest research effort is in the area of HBV care.
Beyond our work in antivirals, we are making great progress in new disease areas for Gilead. We are pleased to be able to share with you today our top line data for GS-4997 in NASH. GS-4997 targets ASK1, a previously unexplored target for NASH. The data are suggestive of a strong anti-fibrotic -- of strong anti-fibrotic activity after only a 24-week period of treatment, and we look forward to future in-depth discussions once the data are presented at AASLD.
We think about GS-4997 as a potential backbone molecule, one that can be used alone or in combination. NASH is an understudied but increasingly prevalent disease, and Gilead's liver disease team now has 3 exciting molecule to move forward in the clinical studies. We understand that there's a lot of work to do in providing both the rationale for the patient and to the payer as to the benefits of treating NASH. An active compound such as GS-4997 could really move the field forward, and we are in the process of designing comprehensive studies to demonstrate that health system benefits of treating such a prevalent and growing disease.
In the area of inflammation, we're executing nicely on our development plan. Phase III studies of filgotinib in RA are up and running, and studies in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis have just begun screening patients in the first of these studies. I'm pleased with the progress we are making, and the work of our teams and collaborators get these trials up and running as quickly as possible. We're also looking forward to exploratory studies of filgotinib in a wider variety of inflammatory diseases so that we can fully understand the potential of this specific JAK1 inhibitor.
As you know, we are also focused on our -- augmenting our portfolio with external opportunities, particularly in the field of oncology. However, our interest in partnerships or potential acquisitions is not limited to oncology, and we are considering opportunities for strong science and where we see the possibility of developing a truly differentiated product.
We have been going through an extensive internal review of programs and opportunities, and an important aspect of our approach is that we remain open minded but disciplined. So while we have the balance sheet to execute on multiple opportunities, we will keep the bar high.
With 2 months of the year remaining, I want to take the opportunity to thank the 9,000 employees of Gilead for their hard work and dedication. Everyday, more than 10 million individuals around the world take a Gilead medication, and everyday, our teams come to work to improve upon that number.

I've got to tell you that I think we're really executing well in the area of hepatitis C. I've spent a lot of time this quarter with many Gileads and with several providers, and I think the variables that we can directly influence, we're really doing a good job on. Our market share is staying incredibly strong. We're ensuring access whilst preserving the value of our hepatitis C drugs. And we're executing on new versions coming to the market. I think you've seen that with Epclusa. And the area that we can less control but we can influence, you're now seeing some new activities from us in terms of unbranded awareness campaigns, and you may have seen our advertisement that came on the television just over a week ago. So I think, from my point of view, in terms of operational excellence, we're doing a very nice job. It is true that the treatments are staying about the same. Actually, I've considered that very positive. Let's not forget that we're at treatment levels that are 2.5x the treatment levels that were there before the Gilead regimens came to the market. So I take at the level of 50,000 to 60,000 patients as very good. The vast proportion of those are Gilead patients. Epclusa had a very big effect in this quarter, so it goes to show that there's still room for new patients, albeit that we're entering a high level of satisfaction. But with Harvoni for genotype 1, both 12 weeks and now a high proportion of 8 weeks and now Epclusa for the 2 and 3 patients, yes, we have got patients being cured at very high levels. In terms of our triple, I do agree that will be a relatively small proportion of patients, but it's the right thing to do. And it completes our whole picture for hepatitis C. So I think to have the range of products that we have, to have the efficacy that we have is the right offering for health care. So we continue to move forward, and I think we have a healthy franchise. And we are getting better access from particularly the commercial payers, although, as I pointed out and I often discuss with the team here, the Medicaid is still a little bit on the slow side in terms of access. But great progress as far as I'm concerned in the third quarter."

And regarding the Phase III study, no, we are going to make the proposal to regulatory authorities to use just fibrosis as the endpoint. We feel very convinced that, that's the right thing to do because, as you may know, fibrosis is the only histological correlate to clinical outcomes. There was a large study published a few years ago where they looked at baseline histology and they correlated histological variables with clinical outcomes. And steatosis didn't correlate. Inflammation didn't correlate. Ballooning didn't correlate. The only thing that correlated was fibrosis. So we are going to propose 2 Phase III studies, both looking at fibrosis 48 week as the endpoint. The other thing, we're going to do the studies in F3, F4 patients. Again, the rationale is that, that's where the unmet need is. And also since ultimately for full approval you will need some clinical endpoint, we think we can get there much faster maybe with a 96-week study even if we start off with F4 patients. But having all of that said, this all has to be agreed upon by regulatory authorities. We have a date with the FDA, but we have not discussed this with them yet. So stay tuned. Sometime early next year, I think we can update you on the exact plan."

It's still fairly a part of our capital allocation strategy along with dividends. But I think balancing that with overall, looking for growth is something that we're still focused on doing. And as John mentioned, these things take time to play their selves out. I'll let Kevin answer the inventory question, but I think to your question of operating margins, yes, but quarterization of our margins do get impacted by revenue dynamics as well as expenses. Keep in mind, R&D had a $200 million milestone payment this quarter included in that. But overall, I think our margins still remain high, high relative to overall industry, much better and we're comfortable with them. We're very prudent with expense management. You saw SG&A expense is down. I think the other thing you're slightly seeing is as the that mix changes between HCV and HIV, that has a little bit of an impact on our growth margin. But overall, with the continued conversion of TAF, long term, you'll continue to see that go down. But it will be impacted relative to HCV becoming a smaller component of our total revenue. I can't really give guidance on our gross margins, but I think the bar still remains high for them, and we still remain a very disciplined spending type of organization."

So first, the U.S. If you look at our slide, actually, the percentage of F0s to F2s has increased over time. It was sort of 50% a little while ago. Now it's up to 60%. So clearly, fitter patients there, the less sick are being treated, and of course, that's as result of coverage. But I want to say that the patient journey, I think, is becoming longer in the U.S. now. If you think about it, patients are really starting further back because they are healthier. We are continuing to see approximately 30,000 patients coming into specialist care so in other words, 90,000 patients a quarter. 60,000 of those are coming out of the other side and are being treated and cured. That's probably not a bad ratio in itself. Not every patient is treated, and not every patient is immediately treated. Now we shouldn't forget that, sometimes, patients drift in and out of a specialist's care. Some patients have compounding factors that complicates the start of therapy, most notably, drug use or alcohol use. And the patients who are just less sick have less motivation themselves, and the physician has less motivation to really push those sort of therapy. And lastly, the paperwork and the administrative process for authorization is still there with -- likely there as with any specialist product. So I think those are mostly the dynamics, and it's mostly around the patients being less time in the physician's practice. They're not patients that have been held for a long time. They're not patients that failed 1 or 2 prior therapies and a great urgency by the physician. In terms of Europe, as I said, we did see a downtick in the patients treated in the southern European markets, primarily Italy and Spain, and I think that's because they are working through the sicker patients and are becoming more like France and Germany. There still are more patients in the southern European markets, but I do think they are clearing the most obvious patients to treat and cure. Now I want to emphasize that market share has stayed very, very solid in those markets. And whilst it's not an obvious mechanism through advertising, television advertising in the European markets, we are doing a lot of partnership with KOLs, with societies, with patient groups to, again, try to encourage the right screening practices and the right transfer of patients into specialist care."

Let's not forget the fact that Gilead are in a very strong place by virtue of Harvoni being in a good proportion of patients in an 8-week therapy. So that's a very big advantage for us, and I think that's really appreciated from a point of view of managing costs from a commercial payer. We didn't see much change in the ratio of the public to private payer in the third quarter. It was still about 45% of patients who were covered as a public patient as opposed to a commercial or Medicare Part D plan. Part of the commercial part of the market is, of course, the VA. The VA was a little bit lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter. They still seem to be very enthusiastic, very engaged in recalling patients. But I think that's, perhaps, one of the variables that will kind of unfold in 2017, is the VA and their continuing ability to recall and treat patients. But I think with our efforts around highlighting the CDC, need to treat the baby boomers and the activity of all the companies involved in hepatitis C, I'd like to think that we can continue our progress in 2017."

So we've -- I believe we've done very well in our position going into 2017. In terms of the ratio between public and private, again, very difficult for me to make a prediction. VA did come down a little bit, but there was an increase, just a tick-up, to replace that by Medicaid. I made the comment that the Medicaid opening is really slower than we would like, but I think there may be that change in mix going forward. Difficult to predict VA. VA is still a big part of the public, and we'll just have to see. It's very impressive what they've done, and I know they're very committed. And they feel that they haven't done their job yet. We, and that's Gilead, we estimate that between 35% and 40% of the patients in the VA system have been treated to date. So still a lot of work to do, and I think they want to do it. So 45% -- 55% seems to have been the level for the last couple of quarters and not entirely clear if that's going to be maintained into 2017, but seems reasonable to me."

Alethia, I was at our international advisory board couple of weeks ago, and we had some of the foremost HIV doctors from around the world. And it was absolutely unanimous. The commitment to switching patients, all things being equal, particularly in terms of pricing, physicians see the benefit in terms of bone and kidney from the point the view of TAF. So I think there's an awful strong commitment. Let's not forget that in most practices now half the patients are over the age of 50, and they've been on long-term therapy. And physicians just see a natural and fairly straightforward switch going on. I'm really -- I really didn't think I'd ever see an uptake quicker than Atripla. As you remember, there were the components of Atripla that could just be put together and the patients switched. These are slightly different with Genvoya because it's a switch of regimen. So I'm delighted with the way it's going. 80% of Genvoya comes from switches, and right now half of those switches are from Stribild, which is the natural TAF to -- TDF-to-TAF switch. So my expectation is that we will continue to convert patients, and I'm super enthusiastic about it. And once we get more countries online in Europe, I think we can have that same expectation.

We are pleased to share our results for the third quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin, Norbert and John will then make a few comments.
Total revenues for the third quarter were $7.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75. This compares to revenues of $8.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.22 for the same period last year.
Product sales for the third quarter were $7.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. These declines were due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, declines in our HCV sales in the U.S., Japan and Europe were partially offset by increases in U.S. HIV and other product sales.
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2 billion, down 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient, primarily due to a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments. The decline was partially offset by demand for Epclusa, which was launched at the end of Q2 2016 and generated $593 million in its first full quarter of sales.
Sequentially, our HCV product sales were down 12%. These sales were essentially flat compared to the second quarter, excluding the favorable adjustment to our HCV sales return of $279 million that we made last quarter. HIV and other anti-viral sales increased 32% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion were positively impacted by strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens and a onetime favorable adjustment of $332 million to our rebate reserves, primarily related to our TDF-based regimens. Without the adjustment, U.S. HIV and other anti-viral sales grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movements. Sequentially, sales were down 12%, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and summer seasonality, consistent with the usual decreases in demand during the European summer holiday months.
In Japan, product sales for the third quarter were $452 million, flat year-over-year, driven by higher sales of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, offset by mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which we discussed during our last call. Sequentially, sales were down 27% as a result of lower Harvoni and Sovaldi patient starts.
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $981 million for the third quarter, up 38% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the progression of our clinical studies, which included a $200 million milestone expense associated with our purchase of Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense.
From a balance sheet perspective, during the third quarter, we generated cash flows from operation of $4.3 billion and ended the quarter with $31.6 billion in cash and investments, which is inclusive of the issuance of $5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We have a healthy balance sheet to invest in our pipeline and external opportunities.  While our cash flows will remain strong, we do anticipate a sequential decrease in Q4 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline.
Shareholder return via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date remains strong. In the third quarter, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. For 2016, the total share repurchases through the third quarter were 110 million shares at a cost of $10 billion. Year-over-year, we have seen an 11% decline in our diluted shares, primarily driven by our share repurchases.
Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance, which was revised on July 25, 2016, and summarized on Slide 27 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measurement -- measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA.
I would like to turn the call over to Kevin now."

I am very pleased to take you through a solid set of operating results for the third quarter.
Starting with HIV. Gilead continues to make significant steps in delivering improved single-tablet regimens to patients around the world. We have seen strong adoption of our TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and in the European markets, where we have achieved reimbursement.
In the U.S., of the nearly 840,000 people on anti-retroviral therapy, approximately 80% receive a Gilead regimen. Genvoya is now the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. This month, we expect cumulative prescriptions of Genvoya to surpass Atripla's prescription at the same point in time post approval. This will make Genvoya the all-time most successful product adoption in its first year in the 30-year history of HIV therapy in this country.
The uptake of Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy have largely been driven by the switch from Gilead's old STRs due to the improved safety profile of TAF. It is also encouraging to see a notable number of patients from non-Gilead therapies moving to TAF-based regimens. Approximately 10% of Genvoya switches are incremental to the Gilead HIV franchise.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other anti-viral revenue was $728 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Third quarter European pharmaceutical revenues are typically affected by summer seasonality. In Italy, Spain and Portugal, we saw lower prescribing rates consistent with prior years. Genvoya has been launched in 18 markets in the U.K. -- in the EU, including Spain and Germany, while we have seen rapid uptake similar to the U.S. Descovy has been launched in 9 markets, and Odefsey has been launched in 8 markets, the largest being Germany in both cases. We expect our TAF-based therapies to continue to grow in Europe with Spain still early in its commercial launch of Genvoya.  Pricing and reimbursement discussions are ongoing in France and Italy with the goal of having these complete by year-end.
Guidelines historically have had a significant impact on prescribing patterns. Genvoya is already listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including the European AIDS Clinical Society as well as country guidelines in Germany, the U.K., Spain and Italy.
I would like to make a few comments about HIV prevention and the use of Truvada for PrEP. The growth in people starting Truvada points to the valuable role that therapy can play when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent transmission. We estimate that in the U.S., approximately 80,000 to 90,000 people were using Truvada for this indication in the third quarter.  We are also starting to see usage of PrEP in France, where approximately 2,000 people have begun -- have been prescribed Truvada since it received reimbursement in January this year. We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead's growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S.
With the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens, the potential of PrEP and our exciting pipeline programs, especially bictegravir, I'm very positive about the long-term life cycle potential we have in HIV.
Turning to HCV. Approximately 61,000 people in total began HCV therapy in the U.S. in the third quarter 2016. This represents the fourth consecutive 3-month period where patient starts have been in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. We estimate that more than 85% of treated patients in the most recent quarter received a sofosbuvir-based regimen.
The uptake of Epclusa has been most encouraging in its first full quarter post launch, although it is important to point out that we have observed a small yet noticeable warehousing effect. As expected, the vast majority of Epclusa is being used in genotype 2 and 3 patients according to our 12-week label. In terms of payer coverage, formulary reviews for Epclusa are on track. 11 state Medicaid programs have already added Epclusa to genotype -- for genotype 2 and 3 patients, and most commercial and Medicare Part D plans are providing interim coverage for Epclusa based on medical need. Finally, the VA has added Epclusa to their national formulary and have begun ordering.
The 2017 commercial and Medicare Part D contracting cycle is now essentially complete. And whilst I cannot share with you plan-by-plan details, suffice to say that we are pleased with the picture for the coming year. Discussions with all major PBMs and MCOs prove to be productive and recognize the clinical leadership of Gilead's HCV options, especially as demonstrated in real-life settings.  But barriers to access still remain as Medicaid continues to be the outlier in terms of access, restricting coverage to only the more advanced patients.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the third quarter was $604 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 22% sequentially. This was driven by lower HCV patient starts. While overall patient starts declined, our market share remained largely unchanged across the major markets with the exception of the U.K., which was slightly down for the quarter.
We estimate that 21,000 patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the third quarter compared to 27,000 in the second quarter. At our last earnings, I described how we were observing lower patient starts in the early EU launch markets of Germany and France. To put simply, many of the high-need patients have been treated and cured. We are now starting to see this trend unfold in southern European countries, particularly in Italy and in Spain. Performance in the region is also likely somewhat affected by summer seasonality similar to the dynamics we observed in HIV.
Epclusa has now been launched in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. I'm pleased to say that there have been the same positive reception as in the U.S. We expect to launch in the other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017.
Not only does 12 weeks of Epclusa deliver incredibly high cure rates, but as a new standard of care, it is considerably cheaper than previously used interferon-free regimens, especially treating genotype 3.
As I conclude my remarks on hepatitis C, it is very important to reiterate that more work needs to be done to identify and cure HCV-infected people around the globe. A key objective for Gilead is to appropriately raise disease awareness, highlight the importance of age-related testing and encourage linkage to specialty care. To help with this effort, we recently launched new educational campaigns in the U.S. and Japan to urge all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider.
You may have seen our new advertisement on television here in the U.S. It debuted last week, and I am very pleased with the positive and responsible tone it takes to emphasize to people the need to be screened for a disease that can now be cured in as little as 8 weeks. We have received numerous positive comments from advocacy groups, providers and not least, the many people already cured of hepatitis C who want others like them to benefit.
Moving on. One other liver disease that warrants a mention today is hepatitis B, for which we are well prepared for the launch of TAF. With our PDUFA date coming up, we are hopeful that we will have the opportunity to speak to physicians at the AASLD meeting and in the field about the strong data for this product as soon as next week.
Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, we have a very strong U.S. cardiovascular team that continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenues totaled $385 million for the quarter and surpassed $1 billion in the year-to-date.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate the positive progress Gilead is making in addressing viral diseases. We will soon have treated 1.2 million HCV-infected individuals around the world, most of whom are now cured. By any measure, this is a profound contribution to global health care delivery.
And in the field of HIV, not only are we effectively managing the disease with our new TAF-based regimens, but Truvada is helping more and more people avoid infection. I am confident that we will close out the year with continued strong financial performance underpinned by a passion for operational excellence and our focus on putting the patient first.
I will now hand the call over to Norbert."

During the third quarter, a number of Phase II and Phase III studies concluded, providing insights into efficacy and safety of both approved and experimental Gilead agents in the areas of HIV, liver disease, inflammation, oncology and cardiovascular disease. Some of these results were disappointments. Some were exciting successes.
To start off with the disappointments. We now have the final analyses from 3 96-week studies of the anti-LOXL2 monoclonal antibody, simtuzumab. The data indicate that while safe and well tolerated, there is no evidence of efficacy in 1 study in primary sclerosing cholangitis and in 2 studies in NASH. One NASH study was in patients with cirrhosis, and one was in patients with bridging fibrosis. Consequently, we will not develop simtuzumab any further in these or any other indications. We will present these data at future conferences.
As for GS-5745, an anti-MMP9 antibody, we stopped a Phase II/III study in patients with ulcerative colitis because of a lack of efficacy. This decision followed a planned interim DSMB analysis after the first 150 patients had been enrolled and the study met predefined futility criteria. Also, and not unexpectedly, there was no evidence of benefit of GS-5745 in a Phase II study in patients with Crohn's disease. Consequently, we will not further pursue GS-5745 for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. In these studies, GS-5745 were safe and well tolerated, and we're continuing to evaluate GS-5745 in rheumatoid arthritis as an add on to anti-TNFs or other therapies.
Eleclazine or GS-6615 failed to meet its primary endpoint in a study of patients with ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or VTVF and implanted cardioverter defibrillators. Patients were randomized to 2 doses of eleclazine or placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of electrical interventions, including shocks and pacing by the implanted device, and there was no evidence of efficacy of eleclazine compared to placebo. Consequently, we will not develop eleclazine any further for VTVF evaluation in long QT-3 syndrome and that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is continuing. 
But now to the excitement. Starting with HCV. The pan-genotypic single-pill, triple-combination regimen of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir or, I'll call it, SOF/VEL/VOX has been studied in 4 Phase III studies called POLARIS-1, -2, -3 and -4. POLARIS-1 and -4 evaluated the regimen in patients who have previously failed a direct acting antiviral and included patients with cirrhosis. Treatment of these salvage patients with SOF/VEL/VOX resulted in SVR rates of 96% and 97%.
The 2 other studies, POLARIS-2 and -3, compared the triple-combination regimen in treatment-naive patients given for 8 weeks to Epclusa given for 12 weeks. POLARIS-2 was open to all genotypes, whereas POLARIS-3 enrolled only genotype-3-infected individuals with compensated cirrhosis, where the unmet need is the greatest. In POLARIS-2, the SVR rates obtained with 12 weeks of Epclusa were numerically higher than those obtained with 8 weeks of the triple combination, whereas in POLARIS-3, the SVR rates were comparable.
Particularly in POLARIS-3, which involved the most difficult to treat, genotype 3 infected cirrhotic patients, Epclusa for 12 weeks resulted in 96% SVR rate. These results underscore the value of Epclusa as an excellent treatment option for patients across all genotypes, and they also suggest that the future role of SOF/VEL/VOX will be for patients who previously failed an anti-viral regimen. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks, and we will submit Marketing Authorization Applications to regulatory authorities imminently.
Another exciting result was the anti-fibrotic effect observed with GS-4997, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 or ASK1. GS-4997 was a shown to inhibit inflammation apoptosis and fibrosis in settings of increased oxidative stress associated with NASH in preclinical models. This Phase II clinical study involved 72 patients. 2/3 had F3-stage fibrosis, and 1/3 had F2-stage fibrosis. There was evidence that treatment with GS-4997 for only 24 weeks resulted in fibrosis reversal and decreased fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest dose tested, which was 18 milligrams, 43% of patients showed at least a 1 point decrease in their fibrosis score compared to only 20% in the simtuzumab control arm. At the same time, 20% of the simtuzumab-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis compared to only 3% or 1 out of 30 at the 18-milligram dose. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks.
Based on these exciting data, we will initiate discussions with regulatory authorities and plan to move GS-4997 into Phase III clinical development in patients with NASH. Based on the Phase II results, we intend to evaluate GS-4997 in patients with the highest unmet need. That means those with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis.
At the same time, we have 2 other compounds with different mechanisms currently in 2 Phase II studies in patients with NASH and fibrosis, and that is GS-9674, an FXR agonist; and GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor. And the studies are of 24- and 12-week duration, respectively. Pending demonstration of single-agent efficacy and safety in these 2 Phase II studies, we plan to initiate combination studies with the 3 agents towards the middle of next year.
In HIV, we're continuing to explore the utility of TAF-containing regimens in various uses in different populations. Last week, data from 3 Phase III studies were presented at the HIV Conference in Glasgow. 96-week data were disclosed from 1 study where 663 biologically suppressed patients were randomized to either continue on their Truvada-based regimen or to switch to a Descovy-based regimen. In 2 other studies, 630 and 875 of largely suppressed patients on Complera and Atripla, respectively, were randomized to switch to Odefsey or stay on their current regimen. In all studies, switching to a TAF-based regimen was noninferior with regards to efficacy but were superior with regards to renal and bone laboratory safety parameters.
The Phase III development of the single-tablet regimen of bictegravir F/TAF is continuing. Four Phase III studies are now fully enrolled, and we anticipate unblinding these studies towards the middle of next year with regulatory submissions planned for the third quarter of 2017. We also plan to present 48-week Phase II data on bictegravir F/TAF at the Scientific Meeting in the first quarter of 2017.
In oncology, a Phase III study of GS-5745 in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing as well as a Phase II study in patients with gastric cancer in combination with nivolumab. We're also evaluating GS-5745 in other solid tumors.
In addition, we have now completed 2 Phase I safety studies of our combination kinase inhibitors. We were able to establish safe doses of our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, in combination with our BTK inhibitor, GS-4059, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with the BTK inhibitor, GS-4059. Consequently, we will now first evaluate the PI3K/BTK combination with and without anti-CD20 therapy in relapsed/refractory CLL patients in collaboration with the German CLL study group.
We will also be announcing initial Phase Ib/II data on our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in acute myeloid leukemia at the upcoming ASH Conference in San Diego. We've entered into a collaboration with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to provide entospletinib for their Beat AML Master Trial. This trial will employ the latest genomic technology to match specific AML mutations in newly diagnosed patients over age of 60 with an appropriate investigational drug or drug combination.
In summary, great progress has been made with some of our programs. The very nature of R&D is that you often face both closures and progress. Going forward, I'm pleased we now have the ability to focus our attention on development programs in NASH, inflammation oncology and HIV. We now have 7 new molecules in advanced clinical development. The PDUFA date for TAF for HBV is coming up in a few weeks, and we plan to file an NDA before the end of the year on SOF/VEL/VOX for use as salvage therapy for patients who have failed a previous direct acting antiviral. 
Four molecules are continuing in Phase III. That is momelotinib for myelofibrosis; bictegravir/F/TAF, the single-tablet regimen for HIV infection; filgotinib for 3 separate indications, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's; and GS-5745 in gastric cancer. Finally, we plan to advance GS-4997 for NASH to Phase III.
I would now like to turn the call over to John."

We continue to have success with the important work we do in HIV and viral hepatitis. There's still a great need for innovation in these deals. Both diseases include patients whose needs remain unaddressed, and both represent global epidemics.
Our researchers are working to bring new options to a wider range of patients than ever before. This includes people with HIV who've been on therapy for decades and may need to change their medication due to side effects or patients who may be failing to fully suppress their virus due to the presence of resistance.  Approaches our research teams are pursuing include new molecules for treating resistant virus now in formulations and combinations that may be dosed infrequently and opportunities to cure HIV patients by clearing out viral reservoir from their bodies.
Our innovative work, in conjunction with our many partners, has already allowed our HIV medicines to reach millions of patients worldwide. We're particularly excited about the role that TAF will play. With a small daily dose and improved side effect profile, it is ideal for resource-constrained areas of the world and requires only 1/10 of the manufacturing capacity to supply the same number of patients.
In the area of viral hepatitis, the data now obtained with Epclusa suggests that we have an excellent option for the many parts of the developing world for genotyping HCV in determining the stage of disease can be difficult, if not, impossible. With Epclusa, there's no difference in dosing for the different genotypes or stages of liver disease, and so there's no need for these diagnostic procedures. We're working around the globe to rapidly introduce Epclusa as well as Sovaldi and Harvoni.
Finally, in hepatitis B, as Kevin and Norbert mentioned, we are approaching the launch of TAF. HBV continues to be an under-treated disease despite the long-term data showing improvement of liver for people who remain on effective therapy. TAF provides an important new option for patients with chronic HBV, and we'll have the opportunity to introduce the product at the liver meeting in the next -- coming weeks at Boston.
We also recognize that treating such a prevalent disease chronically is a major global challenge, and we continue to seek ways to provide finite duration of treatment that the patients can control or eliminate the virus without having to endure a lifetime of treatment. Gilead's largest research effort is in the area of HBV care.
Beyond our work in antivirals, we are making great progress in new disease areas for Gilead. We are pleased to be able to share with you today our top line data for GS-4997 in NASH. GS-4997 targets ASK1, a previously unexplored target for NASH. The data are suggestive of a strong anti-fibrotic -- of strong anti-fibrotic activity after only a 24-week period of treatment, and we look forward to future in-depth discussions once the data are presented at AASLD.
We think about GS-4997 as a potential backbone molecule, one that can be used alone or in combination. NASH is an understudied but increasingly prevalent disease, and Gilead's liver disease team now has 3 exciting molecule to move forward in the clinical studies. We understand that there's a lot of work to do in providing both the rationale for the patient and to the payer as to the benefits of treating NASH. An active compound such as GS-4997 could really move the field forward, and we are in the process of designing comprehensive studies to demonstrate that health system benefits of treating such a prevalent and growing disease.
In the area of inflammation, we're executing nicely on our development plan. Phase III studies of filgotinib in RA are up and running, and studies in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis have just begun screening patients in the first of these studies. I'm pleased with the progress we are making, and the work of our teams and collaborators get these trials up and running as quickly as possible. We're also looking forward to exploratory studies of filgotinib in a wider variety of inflammatory diseases so that we can fully understand the potential of this specific JAK1 inhibitor.
As you know, we are also focused on our -- augmenting our portfolio with external opportunities, particularly in the field of oncology. However, our interest in partnerships or potential acquisitions is not limited to oncology, and we are considering opportunities where there's strong science and where we see the possibility of developing a truly differentiated product.
We have been going through an extensive internal review of programs and opportunities, and an important aspect of our approach is that we remain open minded but disciplined. So while we have the balance sheet to execute on multiple opportunities, we will keep the bar high.
With 2 months of the year remaining, I want to take the opportunity to thank the 9,000 employees of Gilead for their hard work and dedication. Everyday, more than 10 million individuals around the world take a Gilead medication, and everyday, our teams come to work to improve upon that number.

Actually, I've considered that very positive. Let's not forget that we're at treatment levels that are 2.5x the treatment levels that were there before the Gilead regimens came to the market. So I take at the level of 50,000 to 60,000 patients as very good. The vast proportion of those are Gilead patients. Epclusa had a very big effect in this quarter, so it goes to show that there's still room for new patients, albeit that we're entering a high level of satisfaction. But with Harvoni for genotype 1, both 12 weeks and now a high proportion at 8 weeks and now Epclusa for the 2 and 3 patients. Yes, we have got patients being cured at very high levels. In terms of our triple, I do agree that will be a relatively small proportion of patients, but it's the right thing to do. And it completes our whole picture for hepatitis C. So I think to have the range of products that we have, to have the efficacy that we have is the right offering for health care. So we continue to move forward, and I think we have a healthy franchise. And we are getting better access from particularly the commercial payers, although, as I pointed out and I often discuss with the team here, the Medicaid is still a little bit on the slow side in terms of access. But great progress as far as I'm concerned in the third quarter."

And regarding the Phase III study, no, we are going to make the proposal to regulatory authorities to use just fibrosis as the endpoint. We feel very convinced that, that's the right thing to do because, as you may know, fibrosis is the only histological correlate to clinical outcomes. There was a large study published a few years ago where they looked at baseline histology and they correlated histological variables with clinical outcomes. And steatosis didn't correlate. Inflammation didn't correlate. Ballooning didn't correlate. The only thing that correlated was fibrosis. So we are going to propose 2 Phase III studies, both looking at fibrosis 48 week as the endpoint. The other thing, we're going to do with the studies in F3, F4 patients. Again, the rationale is that, that's where the unmet need is. And also since ultimately for full approval you will need some clinical endpoint, we think we can get there much faster maybe with a 96-week study even if we start off with F4 patients. But having all of that said, this all has to be agreed upon by regulatory authorities. We have a date with the FDA, but we have not discussed this with them yet. So stay tuned. Sometime early next year, I think we can update you on the exact plan."

I mean, we really look at buybacks on a long-term perspective, which is pretty much what I committed or mentioned during the last quarter call. So we're still very comfortable where we are. We did front load a significant component of our share buybacks. As a matter of fact, I think, just in the first quarter, we did more than the entire 3 quarters of 2015. And we messaged very early on that we would see those declines towards the second half of this year, very much in alignment with John's comments around being prepared for M&A. It's still clearly a part of our capital allocation strategy along with dividends. But I think balancing that with overall, looking for growth is something that we're still focused on doing. And as John mentioned, these things take time to play their selves out. I'll let Kevin answer the inventory question, but I think to your question of operating margins, yes, but quarterization of our margins do get impacted by revenue dynamics as well as expenses. Keep in mind, R&D had a $200 million milestone payment this quarter included in that. But overall, I think our margins still remain high, high relative to overall industry, much better and we're comfortable with them. We're very prudent with expense management. You saw SG&A expense is down. I think the other thing you're slightly seeing is as the that mix changes between HCV and HIV, that has a little bit of an impact on our growth margin. But overall, with the continued conversion of TAF, long term, you'll continue to see that go down. But it will be impacted relative to HCV becoming a smaller component of our total revenue. I can't really give guidance on our gross margins, but I think the bar still remains high for them, and we still remain a very disciplined spending type of organization."

So first, the U.S. If you look at our slide, actually, the percentage of F0s to F2s has increased over time. It was sort of 50% a little while ago. Now it's up to 60%. So clearly, fitter patients there, the less sick are being treated, and of course, that's as result of coverage. But I want to say that the patient journey, I think, is becoming longer in the U.S. now. If you think about it, patients are really starting further back because they are healthier. We are continuing to see approximately 30,000 patients coming into specialist care so in other words, 90,000 patients a quarter. 60,000 of those are coming out of the other side and are being treated and cured. That's probably not a bad ratio in itself. Not every patient is treated, and not every patient is immediately treated. Now we shouldn't forget that, sometimes, patients drift in and out of a specialist's care. Some patients have compounding factors that complicates the start of therapy, most notably, drug use or alcohol use. And the patients who are just less sick have less motivation themselves, and the physician has less motivation to really push those through therapy. And lastly, the paperwork and the administrative process for authorization is still there with -- like it is with any specialist product. So I think those are mostly the dynamics, and it's mostly around the patients being less time in the physician's practice. They're not patients that have been held for a long time. They're not patients that failed 1 or 2 prior therapies and a great urgency by the physician. In terms of Europe, as I said, we did see a downtick in the patients treated in the southern European markets, primarily Italy and Spain, and I think that's because they are working through the sicker patients and are becoming more like France and Germany. There still are more patients in the southern European markets, but I do think they are clearing the most obvious patients to treat and cure. Now I want to emphasize that market share has stayed very, very solid in those markets. And whilst it's not an obvious mechanism through advertising, television advertising in the European markets, we are doing a lot of partnership with KOLs, with societies, with patient groups to, again, try to encourage the right screening practices and the right transfer of patients into specialist care."

The VA was a little bit lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter. They still seem to be very enthusiastic, very engaged in recalling patients.

You mentioned kind of 2 factors that impact the average per patient price that have been changing. One is the public versus private payer mix, which as you said, changed over last year but maybe stabilized now and then also the rebates given to private payers. You didn't really discuss those too much in this call, but in the past, your predecessor said that he expected the rebates to actually increase when Merck entered the market next year. Some of your comments today could suggest the opposite. So I guess, kind of just curious, for 2017, how should we think about those 2 factors. Do you think public versus private has plateaued? Is 45% the number we should be thinking about for 2017? And then on the rebates to the private payers, should we continue to expect those to tick up in 2017? Or is your feeling different now that you've gone through negotiation cycles?"

I'll take the commercial first. They have gone well. I think, as I keep emphasizing, the advantage we have in 8 weeks, we think about it, 45% right now of Harvoni patients, genotype 1 patients are receiving 8 weeks. So if you think about 45% of genotype 1 with just that 8 weeks, that's a very good economic offering for our payers that they really appreciate. So we've -- I believe we've done very well in our position going into 2017. In terms of the ratio between public and private, again, very difficult for me to make a prediction. VA did come down a little bit, but there was an increase, just a tick-up, to replace that by Medicaid. I made the comment that the Medicaid opening is really slower than we would like, but I think there may be that change in mix going forward. Difficult to predict VA. VA is still a big part of the public, and we'll just have to see. It's very impressive what they've done, and I know they're very committed. And they feel that they haven't done their job yet. We, and that's Gilead, we estimate that between 35% and 40% of the patients in the VA system have been treated to date. So still a lot of work to do, and I think they want to do it. So 45% -- 55% seems to have been the level for the last couple of quarters and not entirely clear if that's going to be maintained into 2017, but seems reasonable to me."

Alethia, I was at our international advisory board couple of weeks ago, and we had some of the foremost HIV doctors from around the world. And it was absolutely unanimous. The commitment to switching patients, all things being equal, particularly in terms of pricing, physicians see the benefit in terms of bone and kidney from the point the view of TAF. So I think there's an awful strong commitment. Let's not forget that in most practices now half the patients are over the age of 50, and they've been on long-term therapy. And physicians just see a natural and fairly straightforward switch going on. I'm really -- I really didn't think I'd ever see an uptake quicker than Atripla. As you remember, there were the components of Atripla that could just be put together and the patients switched. These are slightly different with Genvoya because it's a switch of regimen. So I'm delighted with the way it's going. 80% of Genvoya comes from switches, and right now half of those switches are from Stribild, which is the natural TAF to -- TDF-to-TAF switch. So my expectation is that we will continue to convert patients, and I'm super enthusiastic about it. And once we get more countries online in Europe, I think we can have that same expectation. Germany is going great. Spain is going great. And we're on the threshold of getting the most important market up and running, and that's France."

We are pleased to share our results for the third quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin, Norbert and John will then make a few comments.
Total revenues for the third quarter were $7.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75. This compares to revenues of $8.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.22 for the same period last year.
Product sales for the third quarter were $7.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. These declines were due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, declines in our HCV sales in the U.S., Japan and Europe were partially offset by increases in U.S. HIV and other product sales.
Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2 billion, down 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient, primarily due to a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments. The decline was partially offset by demand for Epclusa, which was launched at the end of Q2 2016 and generated $593 million in its first full quarter of sales.
Sequentially, our HCV product sales were down 12%. These sales were essentially flat compared to the second quarter, excluding the favorable adjustment to our HCV sales return of $279 million that we made last quarter. HIV and other anti-viral sales increased 32% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion were positively impacted by strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens and a onetime favorable adjustment of $332 million to our rebate reserves, primarily related to our TDF-based regimens. Without the adjustment, U.S. HIV and other anti-viral sales grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movements. Sequentially, sales were down 12%, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and summer seasonality, consistent with the usual decreases in demand during the European summer holiday months.
In Japan, product sales for the third quarter were $452 million, flat year-over-year, driven by higher sales of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, offset by mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which we discussed during our last call. Sequentially, sales were down 27% as a result of lower Harvoni and Sovaldi patient starts.
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $981 million for the third quarter, up 38% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the progression of our clinical studies, which included a $200 million milestone expense associated with our purchase of Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense.
From a balance sheet perspective, during the third quarter, we generated cash flows from operation of $4.3 billion and ended the quarter with $31.6 billion in cash and investments, which is inclusive of the issuance of $5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We have a healthy balance sheet to invest in our pipeline and external opportunities.  While our cash flows will remain strong, we do anticipate a sequential decrease in Q4 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline.
Shareholder return via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date remains strong. In the third quarter, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. For 2016, the total share repurchases through the third quarter were 110 million shares at a cost of $10 billion. Year-over-year, we have seen an 11% decline in our diluted shares, primarily driven by our share repurchases.
Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance, which was revised on July 25, 2016, and summarized on Slide 27 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measurement -- measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA.
I would like to turn the call over to Kevin now."

I am very pleased to take you through a solid set of operating results for the third quarter.Starting with HIV. Gilead continues to make significant steps in delivering improved single-tablet regimens to p",1393,"Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to take you through a solid set of operating results for the third quarter.
Starting with HIV. Gilead continues to make significant steps in delivering improved single-tablet regimens to patients around the world. We have seen strong adoption of our TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and in the European markets, where we have achieved reimbursement.
In the U.S., of the nearly 840,000 people on anti-retroviral therapy, approximately 80% receive a Gilead regimen. Genvoya is now the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. This month, we expect cumulative prescriptions of Genvoya to surpass Atripla's prescription at the same point in time post approval. This will make Genvoya the all-time most successful product adoption in its first year in the 30-year history of HIV therapy in this country.
The uptake of Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy have largely been driven by the switch from Gilead's old STRs due to the improved safety profile of TAF. It is also encouraging to see a notable number of patients from non-Gilead therapies moving to TAF-based regimens. Approximately 10% of Genvoya switches are incremental to the Gilead HIV franchise.
Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other anti-viral revenue was $728 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Third quarter European pharmaceutical revenues are typically affected by summer seasonality. In Italy, Spain and Portugal, we saw lower prescribing rates consistent with prior years. Genvoya has been launched in 18 markets in the U.K. -- in the EU, including Spain and Germany, while we have seen rapid uptake similar to the U.S. Descovy has been launched in 9 markets, and Odefsey has been launched in 8 markets, the largest being Germany in both cases. We expect our TAF-based therapies to continue to grow in Europe with Spain still early in its commercial launch of Genvoya.  Pricing and reimbursement discussions are ongoing in France and Italy with the goal of having these complete by year-end.
Guidelines historically have had a significant impact on prescribing patterns. Genvoya is already listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including the European AIDS Clinical Society as well as country guidelines in Germany, the U.K., Spain and Italy.
I would like to make a few comments about HIV prevention and the use of Truvada for PrEP. The growth in people starting Truvada points to the valuable role that therapy can play when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent transmission. We estimate that in the U.S., approximately 80,000 to 90,000 people were using Truvada for this indication in the third quarter.  We are also starting to see usage of PrEP in France, where approximately 2,000 people have begun -- have been prescribed Truvada since it received reimbursement in January this year. We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead's growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S.
With the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens, the potential of PrEP and our exciting pipeline programs, especially bictegravir, I'm very positive about the long-term life cycle potential we have in HIV.
Turning to HCV. Approximately 61,000 people in total began HCV therapy in the U.S. in the third quarter 2016. This represents the fourth consecutive 3-month period where patient starts have been in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. We estimate that more than 85% of treated patients in the most recent quarter received a sofosbuvir-based regimen.
The uptake of Epclusa has been most encouraging in its first full quarter post launch, although it is important to point out that we have observed a small yet noticeable warehousing effect. As expected, the vast majority of Epclusa is being used in genotype 2 and 3 patients according to our 12-week label. In terms of payer coverage, formulary reviews for Epclusa are on track. 11 state Medicaid programs have already added Epclusa to genotype -- for genotype 2 and 3 patients, and most commercial and Medicare Part D plans are providing interim coverage for Epclusa based on medical need. Finally, the VA has added Epclusa to their national formulary and have begun ordering.
The 2017 commercial and Medicare Part D contracting cycle is now essentially complete. And whilst I cannot share with you plan-by-plan details, suffice to say that we are pleased with the picture for the coming year. Discussions with all major PBMs and MCOs prove to be productive and recognize the clinical leadership of Gilead's HCV options, especially as demonstrated in real-life settings.  But barriers to access still remain as Medicaid continues to be the outlier in terms of access, restricting coverage to only the more advanced patients.
Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the third quarter was $604 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 22% sequentially. This was driven by lower HCV patient starts. While overall patient starts declined, our market share remained largely unchanged across the major markets with the exception of the U.K., which was slightly down for the quarter.
We estimate that 21,000 patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the third quarter compared to 27,000 in the second quarter. At our last earnings, I described how we were observing lower patient starts in the early EU launch markets of Germany and France. To put simply, many of the high-need patients have been treated and cured. We are now starting to see this trend unfold in southern European countries, particularly in Italy and in Spain. Performance in the region is also likely somewhat affected by summer seasonality similar to the dynamics we observed in HIV.
Epclusa has now been launched in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. I'm pleased to say that there have been the same positive reception as in the U.S. We expect to launch in the other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017.
Not only does 12 weeks of Epclusa deliver incredibly high cure rates, but as a new standard of care, it is considerably cheaper than previously used interferon-free regimens, especially treating genotype 3.
As I conclude my remarks on hepatitis C, it is very important to reiterate that more work needs to be done to identify and cure HCV-infected people around the globe. A key objective for Gilead is to appropriately raise disease awareness, highlight the importance of age-related testing and encourage linkage to specialty care. To help with this effort, we recently launched new educational campaigns in the U.S. and Japan to urge all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider.
You may have seen our new advertisement on television here in the U.S. It debuted last week, and I am very pleased with the positive and responsible tone it takes to emphasize to people the need to be screened for a disease that can now be cured in as little as 8 weeks. We have received numerous positive comments from advocacy groups, providers and not least, the many people already cured of hepatitis C who want others like them to benefit.
Moving on. One other liver disease that warrants a mention today is hepatitis B, for which we are well prepared for the launch of TAF. With our PDUFA date coming up, we are hopeful that we will have the opportunity to speak to physicians at the AASLD meeting and in the field about the strong data for this product as soon as next week.
Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, we have a very strong U.S. cardiovascular team that continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenues totaled $385 million for the quarter and surpassed $1 billion in the year-to-date.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate the positive progress Gilead is making in addressing viral diseases. We will soon have treated 1.2 million HCV-infected individuals around the world, most of whom are now cured. By any measure, this is a profound contribution to global health care delivery.
And in the field of HIV, not only are we effectively managing the disease with our new TAF-based regimens, but Truvada is helping more and more people avoid infection. I am confident that we will close out the year with continued strong financial performance underpinned by a passion for operational excellence and our focus on putting the patient first.
I will now hand the call over to Norbert."

During the third quarter, a number of Phase II and Phase III studies concluded, providing insights into efficacy and safety of both approved and experimental Gilead agents in the areas of HIV, liver disease, inflammation, oncology and cardiovascular disease. Some of these results were disappointments. Some were exciting successes.
To start off with the disappointments. We now have the final analyses from 3 96-week studies of the anti-LOXL2 monoclonal antibody, simtuzumab. The data indicate that while safe and well tolerated, there is no evidence of efficacy in 1 study in primary sclerosing cholangitis and in 2 studies in NASH. One NASH study was in patients with cirrhosis, and one was in patients with bridging fibrosis. Consequently, we will not develop simtuzumab any further in these or any other indications. We will present these data at future conferences.
As for GS-5745, an anti-MMP9 antibody, we stopped a Phase II/III study in patients with ulcerative colitis because of a lack of efficacy. This decision followed a planned interim DSMB analysis after the first 150 patients had been enrolled and the study met predefined futility criteria. Also, and not unexpectedly, there was no evidence of benefit of GS-5745 in a Phase II study in patients with Crohn's disease. Consequently, we will not further pursue GS-5745 for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. In these studies, GS-5745 were safe and well tolerated, and we're continuing to evaluate GS-5745 in rheumatoid arthritis as an add on to anti-TNFs or other therapies.
Eleclazine or GS-6615 failed to meet its primary endpoint in a study of patients with ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or VTVF and implanted cardioverter defibrillators. Patients were randomized to 2 doses of eleclazine or placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of electrical interventions, including shocks and pacing by the implanted device, and there was no evidence of efficacy of eleclazine compared to placebo. Consequently, we will not develop eleclazine any further for VTVF evaluation in long QT-3 syndrome and that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is continuing. 
But now to the excitement. Starting with HCV. The pan-genotypic single-pill, triple-combination regimen of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir or, I'll call it, SOF/VEL/VOX has been studied in 4 Phase III studies called POLARIS-1, -2, -3 and -4. POLARIS-1 and -4 evaluated the regimen in patients who have previously failed a direct acting antiviral and included patients with cirrhosis. Treatment of these salvage patients with SOF/VEL/VOX resulted in SVR rates of 96% and 97%.
The 2 other studies, POLARIS-2 and -3, compared the triple-combination regimen in treatment-naive patients given for 8 weeks to Epclusa given for 12 weeks. POLARIS-2 was open to all genotypes, whereas POLARIS-3 enrolled only genotype-3-infected individuals with compensated cirrhosis, where the unmet need is the greatest. In POLARIS-2, the SVR rates obtained with 12 weeks of Epclusa were numerically higher than those obtained with 8 weeks of the triple combination, whereas in POLARIS-3, the SVR rates were comparable.
Particularly in POLARIS-3, which involved the most difficult to treat, genotype 3 infected cirrhotic patients, Epclusa for 12 weeks resulted in 96% SVR rate. These results underscore the value of Epclusa as an excellent treatment option for patients across all genotypes, and they also suggest that the future role of SOF/VEL/VOX will be for patients who previously failed an anti-viral regimen. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks, and we will submit Marketing Authorization Applications to regulatory authorities imminently.
Another exciting result was the anti-fibrotic effect observed with GS-4997, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 or ASK1. GS-4997 was a shown to inhibit inflammation apoptosis and fibrosis in settings of increased oxidative stress associated with NASH in preclinical models. This Phase II clinical study involved 72 patients. 2/3 had F3-stage fibrosis, and 1/3 had F2-stage fibrosis. There was evidence that treatment with GS-4997 for only 24 weeks resulted in fibrosis reversal and decreased fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest dose tested, which was 18 milligrams, 43% of patients showed at least a 1 point decrease in their fibrosis score compared to only 20% in the simtuzumab control arm. At the same time, 20% of the simtuzumab-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis compared to only 3% or 1 out of 30 at the 18-milligram dose. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks.
Based on these exciting data, we will initiate discussions with regulatory authorities and plan to move GS-4997 into Phase III clinical development in patients with NASH. Based on the Phase II results, we intend to evaluate GS-4997 in patients with the highest unmet need. That means those with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis.
At the same time, we have 2 other compounds with different mechanisms currently in 2 Phase II studies in patients with NASH and fibrosis, and that is GS-9674, an FXR agonist; and GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor. And the studies are of 24- and 12-week duration, respectively. Pending demonstration of single-agent efficacy and safety in these 2 Phase II studies, we plan to initiate combination studies with the 3 agents towards the middle of next year.
In HIV, we're continuing to explore the utility of TAF-containing regimens in various uses in different populations. Last week, data from 3 Phase III studies were presented at the HIV Conference in Glasgow. 96-week data were disclosed from 1 study where 663 biologically suppressed patients were randomized to either continue on their Truvada-based regimen or to switch to a Descovy-based regimen. In 2 other studies, 630 and 875 of largely suppressed patients on Complera and Atripla, respectively, were randomized to switch to Odefsey or stay on their current regimen. In all studies, switching to a TAF-based regimen was noninferior with regards to efficacy but were superior with regards to renal and bone laboratory safety parameters.
The Phase III development of the single-tablet regimen of bictegravir F/TAF is continuing. Four Phase III studies are now fully enrolled, and we anticipate unblinding these studies towards the middle of next year with regulatory submissions planned for the third quarter of 2017. We also plan to present 48-week Phase II data on bictegravir F/TAF at the Scientific Meeting in the first quarter of 2017.
In oncology, a Phase III study of GS-5745 in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing as well as a Phase II study in patients with gastric cancer in combination with nivolumab. We're also evaluating GS-5745 in other solid tumors.
In addition, we have now completed 2 Phase I safety studies of our combination kinase inhibitors. We were able to establish safe doses of our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, in combination with our BTK inhibitor, GS-4059, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with the BTK inhibitor, GS-4059. Consequently, we will now first evaluate the PI3K/BTK combination with and without anti-CD20 therapy in relapsed/refractory CLL patients in collaboration with the German CLL study group.
We will also be announcing initial Phase Ib/II data on our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in acute myeloid leukemia at the upcoming ASH Conference in San Diego. We've entered into a collaboration with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to provide entospletinib for their Beat AML Master Trial. This trial will employ the latest genomic technology to match specific AML mutations in newly diagnosed patients over age of 60 with an appropriate investigational drug or drug combination.
In summary, great progress has been made with some of our programs. The very nature of R&D is that you often face both closures and progress. Going forward, I'm pleased we now have the ability to focus our attention on development programs in NASH, inflammation oncology and HIV. We now have 7 new molecules in advanced clinical development. The PDUFA date for TAF for HBV is coming up in a few weeks, and we plan to file an NDA before the end of the year on SOF/VEL/VOX for use as salvage therapy for patients who have failed a previous direct acting antiviral. 
Four molecules are continuing in Phase III. That is momelotinib for myelofibrosis; bictegravir/F/TAF, the single-tablet regimen for HIV infection; filgotinib for 3 separate indications, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's; and GS-5745 in gastric cancer. Finally, we plan to advance GS-4997 for NASH to Phase III.
I would now like to turn the call over to John."

We continue to have success with the important work we do in HIV and viral hepatitis. There's still a great need for innovation in these deals. Both diseases include patients whose needs remain unaddressed, and both represent global epidemics.
Our researchers are working to bring new options to a wider range of patients than ever before. This includes people with HIV who've been on therapy for decades and may need to change their medication due to side effects or patients who may be failing to fully suppress their virus due to the presence of resistance.  Approaches our research teams are pursuing include new molecules for treating resistant virus now in formulations and combinations that may be dosed infrequently and opportunities to cure HIV patients by clearing out viral reservoir from their bodies.
Our innovative work, in conjunction with our many partners, has already allowed our HIV medicines to reach millions of patients worldwide. We're particularly excited about the role that TAF will play. With a small daily dose and improved side effect profile, it is ideal for resource-constrained areas of the world and requires only 1/10 of the manufacturing capacity to supply the same number of patients.
In the area of viral hepatitis, the data now obtained with Epclusa suggests that we have an excellent option for the many parts of the developing world for genotyping HCV in determining the stage of disease can be difficult, if not, impossible. With Epclusa, there's no difference in dosing for the different genotypes or stages of liver disease, and so there's no need for these diagnostic procedures. We're working around the globe to rapidly introduce Epclusa as well as Sovaldi and Harvoni.
Finally, in hepatitis B, as Kevin and Norbert mentioned, we are approaching the launch of TAF. HBV continues to be an under-treated disease despite the long-term data showing improvement of liver for people who remain on effective therapy. TAF provides an important new option for patients with chronic HBV, and we'll have the opportunity to introduce the product at the liver meeting in the next -- coming weeks at Boston.
We also recognize that treating such a prevalent disease chronically is a major global challenge, and we continue to seek ways to provide finite duration of treatment that the patients can control or eliminate the virus without having to endure a lifetime of treatment. Gilead's largest research effort is in the area of HBV care.
Beyond our work in antivirals, we are making great progress in new disease areas for Gilead. We are pleased to be able to share with you today our top line data for GS-4997 in NASH. GS-4997 targets ASK1, a previously unexplored target for NASH. The data are suggestive of a strong anti-fibrotic -- of strong anti-fibrotic activity after only a 24-week period of treatment, and we look forward to future in-depth discussions once the data are presented at AASLD.
We think about GS-4997 as a potential backbone molecule, one that can be used alone or in combination. NASH is an understudied but increasingly prevalent disease, and Gilead's liver disease team now has 3 exciting molecule to move forward in the clinical studies. We understand that there's a lot of work to do in providing both the rationale for the patient and to the payer as to the benefits of treating NASH. An active compound such as GS-4997 could really move the field forward, and we are in the process of designing comprehensive studies to demonstrate that health system benefits of treating such a prevalent and growing disease.
In the area of inflammation, we're executing nicely on our development plan. Phase III studies of filgotinib in RA are up and running, and studies in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis have just begun screening patients in the first of these studies. I'm pleased with the progress we are making, and the work of our teams and collaborators get these trials up and running as quickly as possible. We're also looking forward to exploratory studies of filgotinib in a wider variety of inflammatory diseases so that we can fully understand the potential of this specific JAK1 inhibitor.
As you know, we are also focused on our -- augmenting our portfolio with external opportunities, particularly in the field of oncology. However, our interest in partnerships or potential acquisitions is not limited to oncology, and we are considering opportunities where there's strong science and where we see the possibility of developing a truly differentiated product.
We have been going through an extensive internal review of programs and opportunities, and an important aspect of our approach is that we remain open minded but disciplined. So while we have the balance sheet to execute on multiple opportunities, we will keep the bar high.
With 2 months of the year remaining, I want to take the opportunity to thank the 9,000 employees of Gilead for their hard work and dedication. Everyday, more than 10 million individuals around the world take a Gilead medication, and everyday, our teams come to work to improve upon that number.

I've got to tell you that I think we're really executing well in the area of hepatitis C. I've spent a lot of time this quarter with many Gileads and with several providers, and I think the variables that we can directly influence, we're really doing a good job on. Our market share is staying incredibly strong. We're ensuring access whilst preserving the value of our hepatitis C drugs. And we're executing on new versions coming to the market. I think you've seen that with Epclusa. And the area that we can less control but we can influence, you're now seeing some new activities from us in terms of unbranded awareness campaigns, and you may have seen our advertisement that came on the television just over a week ago. So I think, from my point of view, in terms of operational excellence, we're doing a very nice job. It is true that the treatments are staying about the same. Actually, I've considered that very positive. Let's not forget that we're at treatment levels that are 2.5x the treatment levels that were there before the Gilead regimens came to the market. So I take at the level of 50,000 to 60,000 patients as very good. The vast proportion of those are Gilead patients. Epclusa had a very big effect in this quarter, so it goes to show that there's still room for new patients, albeit that we're entering a high level of satisfaction. But with Harvoni for genotype 1, both 12 weeks and now a high proportion at 8 weeks and now Epclusa for the 2 and 3 patients. Yes, we have got patients being cured at very high levels. In terms of our triple, I do agree that will be a relatively small proportion of patients, but it's the right thing to do. And it completes our whole picture for hepatitis C. So I think to have the range of products that we have, to have the efficacy that we have is the right offering for health care. So we continue to move forward, and I think we have a healthy franchise. And we are getting better access from particularly the commercial payers, although, as I pointed out and I often discuss with the team here, the Medicaid is still a little bit on the slow side in terms of access. But great progress as far as I'm concerned in the third quarter."

And regarding the Phase III study, no, we are going to make the proposal to regulatory authorities to use just fibrosis as the endpoint. We feel very convinced that, that's the right thing to do because, as you may know, fibrosis is the only histological correlate to clinical outcomes. There was a large study published a few years ago where they looked at baseline histology and they correlated histological variables with clinical outcomes. And steatosis didn't correlate. Inflammation didn't correlate. Ballooning didn't correlate. The only thing that correlated was fibrosis. So we are going to propose 2 Phase III studies, both looking at fibrosis 48 week as the endpoint. The other thing, we're going to do with the studies in F3, F4 patients. Again, the rationale is that, that's where the unmet need is. And also since ultimately for full approval you will need some clinical endpoint, we think we can get there much faster maybe with a 96-week study even if we start off with F4 patients. But having all of that said, this all has to be agreed upon by regulatory authorities. We have a date with the FDA, but we have not discussed this with them yet. So stay tuned. Sometime early next year, I think we can update you on the exact plan."

It's still clearly a part of our capital allocation strategy along with dividends. But I think balancing that with overall, looking for growth is something that we're still focused on doing. And as John mentioned, these things take time to play their selves out. I'll let Kevin answer the inventory question, but I think to your question of operating margins, yes, but quarterization of our margins do get impacted by revenue dynamics as well as expenses. Keep in mind, R&D had a $200 million milestone payment this quarter included in that. But overall, I think our margins still remain high, high relative to overall industry, much better and we're comfortable with them. We're very prudent with expense management. You saw SG&A expense is down. I think the other thing you're slightly seeing is as the that mix changes between HCV and HIV, that has a little bit of an impact on our growth margin. But overall, with the continued conversion of TAF, long term, you'll continue to see that go down. But it will be impacted relative to HCV becoming a smaller component of our total revenue. I can't really give guidance on our gross margins, but I think the bar still remains high for them, and we still remain a very disciplined spending type of organization."

So first, the U.S. If you look at our slide, actually, the percentage of F0s to F2s has increased over time. It was sort of 50% a little while ago. Now it's up to 60%. So clearly, fitter patients there, the less sick are being treated, and of course, that's as result of coverage. But I want to say that the patient journey, I think, is becoming longer in the U.S. now. If you think about it, patients are really starting further back because they are healthier. We are continuing to see approximately 30,000 patients coming into specialist care so in other words, 90,000 patients a quarter. 60,000 of those are coming out of the other side and are being treated and cured. That's probably not a bad ratio in itself. Not every patient is treated, and not every patient is immediately treated. Now we shouldn't forget that, sometimes, patients drift in and out of a specialist's care. Some patients have compounding factors that complicates the start of therapy, most notably, drug use or alcohol use. And the patients who are just less sick have less motivation themselves, and the physician has less motivation to really push those through therapy. And lastly, the paperwork and the administrative process for authorization is still there with -- like it is with any specialist product. So I think those are mostly the dynamics, and it's mostly around the patients being less time in the physician's practice. They're not patients that have been held for a long time. They're not patients that failed 1 or 2 prior therapies and a great urgency by the physician. In terms of Europe, as I said, we did see a downtick in the patients treated in the southern European markets, primarily Italy and Spain, and I think that's because they are working through the sicker patients and are becoming more like France and Germany. There still are more patients in the southern European markets, but I do think they are clearing the most obvious patients to treat and cure. Now I want to emphasize that market share has stayed very, very solid in those markets. And whilst it's not an obvious mechanism through advertising, television advertising in the European markets, we are doing a lot of partnership with KOLs, with societies, with patient groups to, again, try to encourage the right screening practices and the right transfer of patients into specialist care."

We didn't see much change in the ratio of the public to private payer in the third quarter. It was still about 45% of patients who were covered as a public patient as opposed to a commercial or Medicare Part D plan. Part of the commercial part of the market is, of course, the VA. The VA was a little bit lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter. They still seem to be very enthusiastic, very engaged in recalling patients. But I think that's, perhaps, one of the variables that will kind of unfold in 2017, is the VA and their continuing ability to recall and treat patients.

I made the comment that the Medicaid opening is really slower than we would like, but I think there may be that change in mix going forward. Difficult to predict VA. VA is still a big part of the public, and we'll just have to see. It's very impressive what they've done, and I know they're very committed. And they feel that they haven't done their job yet. We, and that's Gilead, we estimate that between 35% and 40% of the patients in the VA system have been treated to date. So still a lot of work to do, and I think they want to do it.

The commitment to switching patients, all things being equal, particularly in terms of pricing, physicians see the benefit in terms of bone and kidney from the point the view of TAF. So I think there's an awful strong commitment. Let's not forget that in most practices now half the patients are over the age of 50, and they've been on long-term therapy. And physicians just see a natural and fairly straightforward switch going on. I'm really -- I really didn't think I'd ever see an uptake quicker than Atripla. As you remember, there were the components of Atripla that could just be put together and the patients switched. These are slightly different with Genvoya because it's a switch of regimen. So I'm delighted with the way it's going. 80% of Genvoya comes from switches, and right now half of those switches are from Stribild, which is the natural TAF to -- TDF-to-TAF switch.
