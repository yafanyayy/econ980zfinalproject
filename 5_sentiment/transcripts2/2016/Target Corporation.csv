As we look back at both the fourth quarter and the year, we are very pleased with the progress we made throughout 2015. 
Traffic increased in all 4 quarters, and the team delivered on our comparable sales and operating margin rate goals by driving rapid growth in our signature categories. And our full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 was above the top of the range we provided last March, taking us on track to deliver our longer-term financial goals. 
In the fourth quarter, our business generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up $0.03 from a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Comp sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter, building on a 3.8% increase in last year's fourth quarter. 
Target's great store experience, unique items at an unbeatable value and broad, simple promotions resonated with our guests and drove this growth. Transactions, our measure of traffic, increased for the fifth quarter in a row, up 1.3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all of our selling channels. 
Digital sales increased an industry-leading 34% in the fourth quarter, on top of 36% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks drove this increase. In fact, after setting a new digital daily sales record in the week of Black Friday, we shattered all previous records on Cyber Monday. Our offer was broad and simple, 15% off everything on our site, and the guest response was exceptionally strong. 
Our holiday season merchandising and marketing plans were focused on delivering broad, simple and compelling offers like our 10 days of deals, Black Friday door busters and the sitewide offer on Cyber Monday and the bounce-back coupon we offered to guests in our stores on Black Friday, all supported by cohesive marketing plans featuring outstanding creative work. This plan delivered record sales over the November and December period, driven by comp sales in our signature categories: Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, which grew nearly 7% over that 2-month period. 
Sales in Kids were particularly strong with the fastest growth in Toys and Kids Home products. In Style, we saw the fastest growth in Women's Apparel led by double-digit increases in ready-to-wear. And in Wellness, Wearable Electronics and Food led the way. 
Across our traditional category destinations, Apparel grew in the low single-digit range. In hard lines, Toys grew comp sales more than 10% in the quarter, marking the third quarter of double-digit comp growth in Toys. This strength helped offset a sales decline in Electronics, where sales benefited from robust growth in wearables but also reflected the impact of industry-wide softness in tablets. 
Consistent with the third quarter, fourth quarter comp sales in Food grew faster than our overall sales, outpacing trends in the first half of the year, validating the changes we're making to the assortment, presentation and freshness. 
And finally, Home grew about 4% in the fourth quarter. With this performance, Home delivered a 4% comp sales increase for the full year, the strongest annual performance in this category in more than 10 years. 
Finally, prior to the holiday season, we reimagined the C spot save area in the front of our stores, which is large and a very profitable business and transformed it into Bullseye's playground. We modernized the environment, making it easier to navigate, more appealing and fun, incorporating our much loved mascot into store displays. 
While we love the new look, our guest reaction is what really matters, and the fourth quarter results showed they love it, too, as comp sales in Bullseye's playground grew more than 25% compared to C spot save in the fourth quarter of last year. 
December marked an important milestone for the company as we closed on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. Our team has been working closely with our colleagues at CVS, both before and after the sale, to ensure this transition is seamless for our team members and our guests. And while the transition is not yet complete, we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far. 
A small number of our store pharmacies have already been rebranded as CVS locations, and over the next 6 months, we'll complete the rebranding of all our pharmacies and clinics in stores across the country. We believe this transaction will create value for our guests, providing them assets to the capabilities of a best-in-class health care provider while they're shopping our stores, and we expect both Target and CVS to benefit from this transaction, allowing both companies to leverage their respective strengths. 
Importantly, we believe CVS will be able to grow traffic in our store pharmacies faster than we would have been able to do on our own, given our lack of scale when we ran this business. In addition to the ongoing value we'd expect to realize from this arrangement, the sale has already provided more than $1 billion of net cash that we'll use in support of our capital deployment priorities. 
Turning to capital deployment. We generated very strong cash flow in 2015, which we deployed for the benefit of our shareholders. Beyond funding capital investments in support of our strategic and financial goals, in 2015, we returned nearly $5 billion through dividends and share repurchases, well ahead of the goal we set at the beginning of the year. 
Even with this robust return of cash, we ended this year with a very healthy cash balance, positioning Target for another strong year in 2016. 
Now before I turn the call over to John, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for what they accomplished in 2015. As I look back to a year ago, I believe we're operating on a much stronger foundation today. And while we've got much more to accomplish on this journey, the team today is agile and aligned around a small set of key enterprise priorities, allowing us to move much more quickly. 
Today, the team is taking an outside-in approach to our work, understanding how Target fits into the consumer and retail environment as we work to grow the company on behalf of our guests. When Cathy began working with us last year, her first observation was how talented this team is and how passionate they are about both Target and our guests. Not surprisingly. 
That was my first observation when I arrived at Target in 2014, and something I know John has experienced throughout his career with this great company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who'll discuss his team's progress and efforts to improve our operations. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations, and I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. Our work to reduce out of stocks",1169,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations, and I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. 
Our work to reduce out of stocks is continuing to pay off as metrics improved sequentially from the third quarter and even more dramatically when compared with the fourth quarter a year ago. 
Specifically, for the fourth quarter in total, out-of-stock metrics were 20% better line last year, and notably, by the end of the quarter, Target's out-of-stock metrics were 40% better than a year ago as the improvements we implemented allowed for a faster postholiday recovery this year. 
We saw out-of-stock improvements across every category in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in the last conference call, our work has been focused primarily on essential items for which reliability is particularly important for our guests, and I'm really happy with our progress. 
For the set of focused items we designated in essentials, our out-of-stock metrics are better than we have ever measured. While this progress is exciting, I even more pleased that this improvement has been accomplished through systematic and therefore, sustainable changes. In other words, this isn't an example of temporarily adding resources to work around systems and processes. Rather, this is a case of making improvements to those systems and processes to support a sustainable improvement in performance. 
Because upstream variability in the supply chain hampers our ability to keep our stores in stock and provide tight shipping windows to our guests, a key pillar of the team's work is focused on improving flow through the supply chain. As part of this effort, the team has created smart, systematic rules governing safety stock in distribution centers and have optimized frequencies on priority items. In the fourth quarter, the team began an array of test to reduce variability of inbound shipments at our DCs with a goal of reducing inbound variability by 50%. 
Similarly, the team plans to engage in test to optimize outbound volatility, which will further improve overall freight flow. While we are still early in this journey, the teams work on flow was a key reason we saw much faster recovery this holiday season and why we entered 2016 with a much better in-stock position than a year ago. 
Beyond in-stocks, we are entering 2016 with very little clearance inventory even compared to a strong position a year ago. As you'll recall, last year's fourth quarter sales were much stronger than expected as we plan for a 2% comp and ended up with growth nearly twice as high. 
With last year's unexpectedly strong sales, we saw very high sell-through percentages on Seasonal merchandise. However, as a result of great product and of the changes we've implemented this year, quarter-end sell-throughs on seasonal merchandise were slightly better than last year, putting us in a very clean inventory position at the beginning of the year. 
These are just a few examples of the team's work to implement quick solutions that are already having a tangible impact on our results. At the same time, we are working to build capabilities that will support our future growth. I'll provide a lot more detail on these future focus efforts in my remarks at next week's meeting. 
As you know, we have been building our flexible fulfillment capabilities for several years, and this holiday season highlighted the power of these capabilities to serve our guests and drive business performance. And while we've added capacity across our entire direct-to-guest network, our fourth quarter experience demonstrated power of our relying on our stores to fill digital demand. 
This holiday season, our stores fulfilled 30% of our digital orders through the combination of order pickup and direct-to-guest shipments. On Black Friday weekend alone, our stores fulfilled more than 1 million digital orders. And even though the traditional view of Cyber Monday doesn't even include brick-and-mortar, Target stores set an all-time record for order pickup on that day with more than [ph] 4x the volume compared with last year. 
And like last year, order pickup became even more important the days leading up to Christmas, growing to half our digital volume. While our stores help us save meaningfully on shipping costs and allow us to fulfill gas demand faster, they also help us capture more sales. Because we now have a single view of inventory encompassing all of our distribution center and store locations, we can rely on our entire network when fulfilling digital orders, keeping us in stock on a greater percentage of digital orders. 
Specifically, during the holiday season, about 40% of our order pickup and store shipped volume consisted of items that are out of stock in our web fulfillment centers. This preserved sales on orders we would have otherwise missed had we only accessed inventory in our web fulfillment centers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I also want to provide an update on our decision to bring visual merchandising talent into our stores. Last fall, we announced we were filling more than 1,400 new visual merchant positions in our store organization. In scoping responsibilities for these roles, we benchmarked industry leaders to define the necessary capabilities and enhanced our interviewing process to better assess for these skills when interviewing potential candidates. The majority of these positions have been filled by external candidates with experience at other retailers, but we have also attracting the talent that we identified within the organization. 
Our visual merchants are focused on Style categories in our Home, Apparel and Seasonal areas and are trained to rely on sales and inventory data while developing compelling visual presentations in our stores. As a result, their job requires that they balance art with science and productivity with creativity. And because of their unique qualifications, this team is responsible for training their store team colleagues to understand the latest product trends study so the entire store team can better assist our guests as they shop our stores. 
While the visual merchandising team is just ramping up its processes and tools, we can already see the early impact of their efforts in our store displays, and we are very excited about the potential this effort to elevate both signature categories and our store experience. 
Thinking back to the year just ended, it's amazing for me to realize that we only formed our new operations team about 6 months ago. In that time, we've already seen meaningful improvement in our operations, and we're entering the year with much in-stock position than the year ago. As we look ahead, we see multiple opportunities to improve end-to-end processes and build the foundation for our future growth while improving the shopping experience for our guests and enhancing our business results. I look forward to discussing these opportunities with you in New York next week. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our fourth quarter financial performance. Cathy?"

As Brian mentioned earlier, we are really pleased that our team delivered strong traffic and sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our financial results continue to validate the strategic changes we've made, confirming that we are focused on what's most important to our guests. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 was well within our guidance range and up $0.03 from last year's very strong performance. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.31 was $0.79 above adjusted EPS, reflecting the $620 million pretax gain on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. 
Comparable sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter on top of a 3.8% increase in 2014. Traffic was the primary driver of our comp growth, up 1.3%, building on a really strong 3.2% increase last year. This quarter marked our fifth straight quarter of traffic growth, and we are committed to driving continue traffic growth in 2016 and beyond. 
As I mentioned last quarter, results in our fourth quarter 2014 reflected a bounce back from the impact of the breach in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, even on a 3-year stack basis, our traffic was stronger in this year's fourth quarter than earlier in the year, demonstrating continued momentum from these strategic changes we've implemented. 
One note. Fourth quarter reported sales were down a little less than 1% from last year, reflecting our comp sales increase, offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business, which closed in mid-December. 
Digital sales grew 34% in the fourth quarter, and we saw the most dramatic increases in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday week. These increases were driven by our simple, broad and compelling offers. And as John mentioned, our flexible fulfillment capabilities played a key role in driving our fourth quarter digital sales growth. 
REDcard penetration was 23% in the fourth quarter, up about 190 basis points from 21.1% last year. This increase represents a moderate acceleration from the trends we were seeing earlier in the year combined with the impact of the removal of our pharmacy sales. Because a meaningful portion of our pharmacy sales consisted of reimbursements from third parties, REDcard penetration on our total pharmacy sales was very low. As a result, the pharmacy sale will increase REDcard penetration throughout 2016, and to add clarity, we provided an apples-to-apples comparison in our press release schedule. 
For the fourth quarter, REDcard penetration would have been up about 160 basis points from last year had pharmacy sales been removed from both years. Our fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 9.8% was flat to last year's strong performance. Among the drivers, fourth quarter gross margin rate was down about 50 [ph] basis points from last year, reflecting a small benefit from sales mix, including the removal of pharmacy sales, offset by investments in promotion. 
As John mentioned earlier, last year's stronger-than-expected comparable sales growth drove very strong gross margin rate performance in fourth quarter 2014 as regular price selling on Seasonal items was unusually high. This year, with sales in line with our expectations, our gross margin rate reverted to a more normal level, given the competitive dynamics we faced in the fourth quarter. 
Every holiday season, we gain insights into the evolution of our guests' shopping behavior, and this year's results showed us that clear, compelling, broad-based offers are appealing to our guests. This insight will inform our strategy as we work to further refine our promotional effectiveness in 2016. 
Favorability in our selling, general and administrative expenses rates offset the fourth quarter gross margin rate decline. This performance reflected an increase in our store Apparel expense rate, driven by investments in our store team, including the visual merchants John mentioned earlier, partially offset by underlying improvement in unit productivity. However, the pressure from store labor expense was offset by favorability in our marketing and bonus expense rates and disciplined spending across the organization. 
At the end of the year, our merchandise inventory was up about 4% from a year ago, a bit more than our current sales trends. As John mentioned, we ended the year with a very clean inventory position, and the year-over-year increase reflects intentional inventory investments, which are supporting record in-stock levels in our focus categories. 
Turning now to capital deployment. We paid dividends of $345 million in the fourth quarter, up 4.4% from a year ago. Our business results and cash position also enabled $1.3 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter, meaning we returned more than 110% of our net income through dividends and share repurchases. 
And even though we returned about $4.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015, we ended the year with a healthy cash position, including cash from the CVS transaction, which closed late in the year. 
Before I turn to our guidance for the first quarter and provide some insights of our financial plan for the year, I want to review last year's performance against the guidance we provided a year ago. 
Let's start with sales. A year ago, we laid out a plan to grow total sales 2% to 3% on comp sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% led by growth in our signature category. We achieved our comp sales goal by generating very solid growth of 2.1%, and comp growth in signature categories was more than 2.5x as high as our comparable sales growth overall. 
Total sales grew slower than comps this year due to the removal of pharmacy sales beginning in December. Of course, the sale of the pharmacy business was not reflected in our guidance a year ago as we didn't enter into the deal until June. However, while the sale of the pharmacy business will continue to affect our total sales this year, we first articulated the expected benefits of the deal in June, which includes faster traffic growth, higher profit dollars and rates and higher ROIC from the upfront capital we received from CVS. 
Now let's turn to digital. A year ago, we laid out a goal to grow Target's digital sales an industry-leading 40%. And while we didn't quite make this ambitious goal, we did lead the industry with 31% digital sales growth in 2015. With this growth, we delivered our financial goals, and we gained deeper insight into how our guests want to interact with Target. 
Moving down the P&L. A year ago, we said we expected to grow our segment EBITDA rate 20 to 30 basis points in 2015, driven by modest improvements in both our gross margin and our SG&A expense rate. We ended the year ahead of that goal, up about 50 basis points, reflecting favorability on both the gross margin and the SG&A expense line. 
Turning to capital deployment. A year ago, we were expecting 2015 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion, planning for a 5% to 10% increase in the quarterly dividend in the middle of the year, and we expected $2 billion or more in share repurchases for the full year. 
How did the year turn out? We spent about $1.4 billion on capital expenditures in 2015. We hit the middle of our guidance with a board-approved 7.7% dividend increase in June, and we exceeded our share repurchase guidance with about $3.4 billion in shares retired this year. 
Our 2015 share repurchase capacity reflected robust cash generation by our business and of course, additional capacities from the closing of the sale of our pharmacy business in December. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our 2015 spending reflected the retiming certain projects resulting from prioritization efforts in initiated by our new Chief Information Officer, Mike McNamara, and his team. Following his arrival in the middle of the year, Mike dramatically reduced the number of noninfrastructure technology projects in order to refocus resources on the highest priority initiatives and make faster progress. 
In addition, Mike's team began hiring hundreds of additional engineers in order to reduce our reliance on contractors and vendors. These changes reflect our commitment to prioritize spending on both capital and expense to best support our enterprise priorities. And in the current environment, our spending priorities are currently tilting towards expense, including investments in technology engineers; in our store team, including the hiring of visual merchants; and in our headquarters team in the areas of data science and operational excellence. 
So how did the elements of our 2015 P&L translate into adjusted EPS? By achieving our cost sales goal while exceeding our guidance for profit margin and share repurchase, we delivered $4.69 of adjusted EPS this year, above our guidance range of $4.45 to $4.65 and more than 11% higher than 2014. 
And while we didn't provide specific guidance for return on invested capital in 2015, we reported after-tax ROIC of 16% this year. I'll quickly note because the ROIC cancellation doesn't adjust for nonrecurring items, this year's performance included the gain on the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding this gain, our business generated a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 13.9% for the year, up well over a percentage point from 2014. 
So with full year 2015 performance as context, let's turn to our detailed guidance for first quarter. I will also provide some high-level details of our plan for the year and discuss those plans in more detail at our meeting next week. 
I'll start with our view of comparable sales for the full year. We are planning for comp growth in the 1.5% to 2.5% range in 2016, consistent with our performance throughout last year. Given that we're 1 year into a multiyear journey, at next week's meeting, I'll discuss why we believe we have the capacity to grow comps a bit faster than this range over time. However, in the current environment, we believe it is a prudent range to plan for this next year. 
With that context on full year sales, I'll turn to the first quarter. As we plan our first quarter comp in light of competitor inventory positions, we're anticipating growth in the lower end of the 1.5% range to 2.5% range we're planning for the full year. First quarter reported total sales are expected to decline 4.5% to 5%, reflecting removal of pharmacy sales from this year's results. 
One note on our sales guidance. We haven't specified a goal for digital sales growth. I'll discuss our reasoning for this change in more detail next week, but for now, I'll simply stress that our commitment to digital is as strong as ever. And while we will continue to include digital metrics in our financial reporting this year, we are going to gauge our success based on Target's overall traffic and sales growth without making an arbitrary distinction between channel. This change is consistent with how our guests think about shopping as we've confirmed with our guest research. 
Moving on to the first quarter P&L. On the EBITDA margin rate, we are expecting an improvement of 50 [ph] to 70 basis points in the first quarter, driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a moderate increase in SG&A expense rate. The expected gross margin rate improvement primarily reflects the benefits of the removal of low-margin pharmacy sales from the mix combined with a moderate improvement in the underlying business. 
On the SG&A line, our forecast anticipates some pressure from the investments we're making in our store teams along with incremental expense from the reissuance of REDcard debit and credit cards as we move guest to much more secure chip and PIN technology. 
On the depreciation and amortization expense line, we are expecting 20 to 30 basis points of pressure in the first quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales and a slight increase in D&A dollars over last year. We expect first quarter interest rate -- interest expense dollars to be flat to last year. We're planning for a first quarter effective income tax rate of 35% to 36%, and we expect to continue to engage in meaningful share repurchase given our cash position. 
Altogether, these expectations position us to deliver first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 compared with $1.10 a year ago. 
Turning back to full year. We expect to deliver full year 2016 adjusted EPS of $5.20 to $5.40, and I'll provide more detail on the individual P&L items next week. 
For now, I would note that this performance would exceed our longer-term financial algorithm to generate annual adjusted EPS growth of about 10% as it reflects the expected share repurchase benefit of the incremental cash we deploy -- we'll deploy from the sale of our pharmacy business. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who is going to provide a quick preview of next week's financial community meeting. Brian?"

On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance, including results across our merchandise categories. Then John will provide an update on our efforts to improve in-stocks and build our supply chain capabilities. And finally, Cathy will offer more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.

Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure; and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases.
Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, one note, given that we're hosting our financial community meeting next week, our remarks today will focus on Target's fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016. At next week's meeting, we will provide insights into our strategy and priorities and how they will drive our financial performance in 2016 and beyond.

As we look back at both the fourth quarter and the year, we are very pleased with the progress we made throughout 2015. 
Traffic increased in all 4 quarters, and the team delivered on our comparable sales and operating margin rate goals by driving rapid growth in our signature categories. And our full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 was above the top of the range we provided last March, keeping us on track to deliver our longer-term financial goals. 
In the fourth quarter, our business generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up $0.03 from a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Comp sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter, building on a 3.8% increase in last year's fourth quarter. 
Target's great store experience, unique items at an unbeatable value and broad, simple promotions resonated with our guests and drove this growth. Transactions, our measure of traffic, increased for the fifth quarter in a row, up 1.3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all of our selling channels. 
Digital sales increased an industry-leading 34% in the fourth quarter, on top of 36% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks drove this increase. In fact, after setting a new digital daily sales record in the week of Black Friday, we shattered all previous records on Cyber Monday. Our offer was broad and simple, 15% off everything on our site, and the guest response was exceptionally strong. 
Our holiday season merchandising and marketing plans were focused on delivering broad, simple and compelling offers, like our 10 Days of Deals, Black Friday doorbusters and the site-wide offer on Cyber Monday and the bounce-back coupon we offered to guests in our stores on Black Friday, all supported by cohesive marketing plans featuring outstanding creative work. This plan delivered record sales over the November and December period, driven by comp sales in our signature categories: Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, which grew nearly 7% over that 2-month period. 
Sales in Kids were particularly strong, with the fastest growth in Toys and Kids Home products. In Style, we saw the fastest growth in women's apparel, led by double-digit increases in ready-to-wear. And in Wellness, wearable electronics and Food led the way. 
Across our traditional category destinations, Apparel grew in the low single-digit range. In Hardlines, Toys grew comp sales more than 10% in the quarter, marking the third quarter of double-digit comp growth in Toys. This strength helped offset a sales decline in Electronics, where sales benefited from robust growth in wearables but also reflected the impact of industry-wide softness in tablets. 
Consistent with the third quarter, fourth quarter comp sales in Food grew faster than our overall sales, outpacing trends in the first half of the year, validating the changes we're making to the assortment, presentation and freshness. 
And finally, Home grew about 4% in the fourth quarter. With this performance, Home delivered a 4% comp sales increase for the full year, the strongest annual performance in this category in more than 10 years. 
Finally, prior to the holiday season, we reimagined the See. Spot. Save. area in the front of our stores, which is large and a very profitable business, and transformed it into Bullseye's Playground. We modernized the environment, making it easier to navigate, more appealing and fun, incorporating our much-loved mascot into store displays. 
While we love the new look, our guest reaction is what really matters, and the fourth quarter results showed they loved it too as comp sales in Bullseye's Playground grew more than 25% compared to See. Spot. Save. in the fourth quarter of last year. 
December marked an important milestone for the company as we closed on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. Our team has been working closely with our colleagues at CVS, both before and after the sale, to ensure this transition is seamless for our team members and our guests. And while the transition is not yet complete, we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far. 
A small number of our store pharmacies have already been rebranded as CVS locations, and over the next 6 months, we'll complete the rebranding of all our pharmacies and clinics in stores across the country. We believe this transaction will create value for our guests, providing them access to the capabilities of a best-in-class health care provider while they're shopping our stores. And we expect both Target and CVS to benefit from this transaction, allowing both companies to leverage their respective strengths. 
Importantly, we believe CVS will be able to grow traffic in our store pharmacies faster than we would have been able to do on our own, given our lack of scale when we ran this business. In addition to the ongoing value we'd expect to realize from this arrangement, the sale has already provided more than $1 billion of net cash that we'll use in support of our capital deployment priorities. 
Turning to capital deployment. We generated very strong cash flow in 2015, which we deployed for the benefit of our shareholders. Beyond funding capital investments in support of our strategic and financial goals, in 2015, we returned nearly $5 billion through dividends and share repurchases, well ahead of the goal we set at the beginning of the year. 
Even with this robust return of cash, we ended this year with a very healthy cash balance, positioning Target for another strong year in 2016. 
Now before I turn the call over to John, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for what they accomplished in 2015. As I look back to a year ago, I believe we're operating on a much stronger foundation today. And while we've got much more to accomplish on this journey, the team today is agile and aligned around a small set of key enterprise priorities, allowing us to move much more quickly. 
Today, the team is taking an outside-in approach to our work, understanding how Target fits into the consumer and retail environment as we work to grow the company on behalf of our guests. When Cathy began working with us last year, her first observation was how talented this team is and how passionate they are about both Target and our guests. Not surprisingly, that was my first observation when I arrived at Target in 2014 and something I know John has experienced throughout his career with this great company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's progress in efforts to improve our operations. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations, and I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. Our work to reduce out-of-stocks",1177,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations, and I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. 
Our work to reduce out-of-stocks is continuing to pay off as metrics improved sequentially from the third quarter and even more dramatically when compared with the fourth quarter a year ago. 
Specifically, for the fourth quarter in total, out-of-stock metrics were 20% better than last year, and notably, by the end of the quarter, Target's out-of-stock metrics were 40% better than a year ago as the improvements we've implemented allowed for a faster post-holiday recovery this year. 
We saw out-of-stock improvements across every category in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in the last conference call, our work has been focused primarily on essential items for which reliability is particularly important for our guests, and I'm really happy with our progress. 
For the set of focused items we've designated in essentials, our out-of-stock metrics are better than we have ever measured. While this progress is exciting, I'm even more pleased with -- that this improvement has been accomplished through systematic and therefore sustainable changes. In other words, this isn't an example of temporarily adding resources to work around systems and processes. Rather, this is a case of making improvements to those systems and processes to support a sustainable improvement in performance. 
Because upstream variability in the supply chain hampers our ability to keep our stores in stock and provide tight shipping windows to our guests, a key pillar of the team's work is focused on improving freight flow through the supply chain. As part of this effort, the team has created smart, systematic rules governing safety stock in distribution centers and they have optimized pick frequencies on priority items. In the fourth quarter, the team began an array of tests to reduce variability of inbound shipments at our DCs, with a goal of reducing inbound variability by 50%. 
Similarly, the team plans to engage in tests to optimize outbound volatility, which will further improve overall freight flow. While we are still early in this journey, the team's work on flow was a key reason we saw a much faster recovery this holiday season and why we entered 2016 with a much better in-stock position than a year ago. 
Beyond in-stocks, we are entering 2016 with very little clearance inventory even compared to a strong position a year ago. As you'll recall, last year's fourth quarter sales were much stronger than expected as we planned for a 2% comp and ended up with growth nearly twice as high. 
With last year's unexpectedly strong sales, we saw very high sell-through percentages on Seasonal merchandise. However, as a result of great product and of the changes we've implemented this year, quarter end sell-throughs on Seasonal merchandise were slightly better than last year, putting us in a very clean inventory position at the beginning of the year. 
These are just a few examples of the team's work to implement quick solutions that are already having a tangible impact on our results. At the same time, we are working to build capabilities that will support our future growth. I'll provide a lot more detail on these future focus efforts in my remarks at next week's meeting. 
As you know, we have been building our flexible fulfillment capabilities for several years, and this holiday season highlighted the power of these capabilities to serve our guests and drive business performance. And while we've added capacity across our entire direct-to-guest network, our fourth quarter experience demonstrated the power of relying on our stores to fill digital demand. 
This holiday season, our stores fulfilled 30% of our digital orders through the combination of order pickup and direct-to-guest shipments. On Black Friday weekend alone, our stores fulfilled more than 1 million digital orders. And even though the traditional view of Cyber Monday doesn't even include brick-and-mortar, Target stores set an all-time record for order pickup on that day, with more than 4x the volume compared with last year. And like last year, order pickup became even more important the days leading up to Christmas, growing to half our digital volume. 
While our stores help us save meaningfully on shipping costs and allow us to fulfill guest demand faster, they also help us capture more sales. Because we now have a single view of inventory encompassing all of our distribution center and store locations, we can rely on our entire network when fulfilling digital orders, keeping us in stock on a greater percentage of digital orders. 
Specifically, during the holiday season, about 40% of our order pickup and store-shipped volume consisted of items that were out of stock in our web fulfillment centers. This preserved sales on orders we would have otherwise missed have we only accessed inventory in our web fulfillment centers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I also want to provide an update on our decision to bring visual merchandising talent into our stores. Last fall, we announced we were filling more than 1,400 new visual merchant positions in our store organization. In scoping responsibilities for these roles, we benchmarked industry leaders to define the necessary capabilities and enhanced our interview process to better assess for these skills when interviewing potential candidates. The majority of these positions have been filled by external candidates with experience at other retailers, but we have also tapped in the talent that we identified within the organization. 
Our visual merchants are focused on Style categories in our Home, Apparel and Seasonal areas, and they are trained to rely on sales and inventory data while developing compelling visual presentations in our stores. As a result, their job requires that they balance art with science and productivity with creativity. And because of their unique qualifications, this team is responsible for training their store team colleagues to understand the latest product trends so the entire store team can better assist our guests as they shop our stores. 
While the visual merchandising team is just ramping up its processes and tools, we can already see the early impact of their effort in our store displays, and we are very excited about the potential of this effort to elevate both signature categories and our store experience. 
Thinking back to the year just ended, it's amazing for me to realize that we only formed our new operations team about 6 months ago. In that time, we have already seen meaningful improvement in our operations and we're entering the year with a much stronger in-stock position than a year ago. As we look ahead, we see multiple opportunities to improve end-to-end processes and build the foundation for our future growth while improving the shopping experience for our guests and enhancing our business results. I look forward to discussing these opportunities with you in New York next week. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our fourth quarter financial performance. Cathy?"

As Brian mentioned earlier, we are really pleased that our team delivered strong traffic and sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our financial results continue to validate the strategic changes we've made, confirming that we are focused on what's most important to our guests. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 was well within our guidance range and up $0.03 from last year's very strong performance. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.31 was $0.79 above adjusted EPS, reflecting the $620 million pretax gain on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. 
Comparable sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter on top of a 3.8% increase in 2014. Traffic was the primary driver of our comp growth, up 1.3%, building on a really strong 3.2% increase last year. This quarter marked our fifth straight quarter of traffic growth, and we are committed to driving continued traffic growth in 2016 and beyond. 
As I mentioned last quarter, results in our fourth quarter 2014 reflected a bounce-back from the impact of the breach in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, even on a 3-year stacked basis, our traffic was stronger in this year's fourth quarter than earlier in the year, demonstrating continued momentum from the strategic changes we've implemented. 
One note. Fourth quarter reported sales were down a little less than 1% from last year, reflecting our comp sales increase, offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business, which closed in mid-December. 
Digital sales grew 34% in the fourth quarter, and we saw the most dramatic increases in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks. These increases were driven by our simple, broad and compelling offers, and as John mentioned, our flexible fulfillment capabilities played a key role in driving our fourth quarter digital sales growth. 
REDcard penetration was 23% in the fourth quarter, up about 190 basis points from 21.1% last year. This increase represents a moderate acceleration from the trends we were seeing earlier in the year, combined with the impact of the removal of our pharmacy sales. Because a meaningful portion of our pharmacy sales consisted of reimbursements from third parties, REDcard penetration on our total pharmacy sales was very low. As a result, the pharmacy sale will increase REDcard penetration throughout 2016, and to add clarity, we've provided an apples-to-apples comparison in our press release schedules. 
For the fourth quarter, REDcard penetration would have been up about 160 basis points from last year had pharmacy sales been removed from both years. Our fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 9.8% was flat to last year's strong performance. Among the drivers, fourth quarter gross margin rate was down about 50 basis points from last year, reflecting a small benefit from sales mix, including the removal of pharmacy sales, offset by investments in promotions. 
As John mentioned earlier, last year's stronger-than-expected comparable sales growth drove very strong gross margin rate performance in fourth quarter 2014 as regular price selling on Seasonal items was unusually high. This year, with sales in line with our expectations, our gross margin rate reverted to a more normal level, given the competitive dynamics we faced in the fourth quarter. 
Every holiday season, we gain insights into the evolution of our guests' shopping behavior, and this year's results showed us that clear, compelling, broad-based offers are appealing to our guests. This insight will inform our strategy as we work to further refine our promotional effectiveness in 2016. 
Favorability in our selling, general and administrative expense rate offset the fourth quarter gross margin rate decline. This performance reflected an increase in our store Apparel expense rate, driven by investments in our store team, including the visual merchants John mentioned earlier, partially offset by underlying improvement in unit productivity. However, the pressure from store labor expense was offset by favorability in our marketing and bonus expense rates and disciplined spending across the organization. 
At the end of the year, our merchandise inventory was up about 4% from a year ago, a bit more than our current sales trends. As John mentioned, we ended the year with a very clean inventory position, and the year-over-year increase reflects intentional inventory investments, which are supporting record in-stock levels in our focus categories. 
Turning now to capital deployment. We paid dividends of $345 million in the fourth quarter, up 4.4% from a year ago. Our business results and cash position also enabled $1.3 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter, meaning we returned more than 110% of our net income through dividends and share repurchases. 
And even though we returned about $4.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015, we ended the year with a healthy cash position, including cash from the CVS transaction, which closed late in the year. 
Before I turn to our guidance for the first quarter and provide some insights of our financial plan for the year, I want to review last year's performance against the guidance we provided a year ago. 
Let's start with sales. A year ago, we laid out a plan to grow total sales 2% to 3% on comp sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% led by growth in our signature categories. We achieved our comp sales goal by generating very solid growth of 2.1%, and comp growth in signature categories was more than 2.5x as high as our comparable sales growth overall. 
Total sales grew slower than comps this year due to the removal of the pharmacy sales beginning in December. Of course, the sale of the pharmacy business was not reflected in our guidance a year ago as we didn't enter into the deal until June. However, while the sale of the pharmacy business will continue to affect our total sales this year, we first articulated the expected benefits of the deal in June, which includes faster traffic growth, higher profit dollars and rates and higher ROIC from the upfront capital we received from CVS. 
Now let's turn to digital. A year ago, we laid out a goal to grow Target's digital sales an industry-leading 40%. And while we didn't quite make this ambitious goal, we did lead the industry with 31% digital sales growth in 2015. With this growth, we delivered our financial goals and we gained deeper insights into how our guests want to interact with Target. 
Moving down the P&L. A year ago, we said we expected to grow our segment EBITDA rate 20 to 30 basis points in 2015, given -- driven by modest improvements in both our gross margin and our SG&A expense rate. We ended the year ahead of that goal, up about 50 basis points, reflecting favorability on both the gross margin and the SG&A expense lines. 
Turning to capital deployment. A year ago, we were expecting 2015 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion, planning for a 5% to 10% increase in the quarterly dividend in the middle of the year, and we expected $2 billion or more in share repurchases for the full year. 
How did the year turn out? We spent about $1.4 billion on capital expenditures in 2015. We hit the middle of our guidance with a board-approved 7.7% dividend increase in June. And we exceeded our share repurchase guidance with about $3.4 billion in shares retired this year. 
Our 2015 share repurchase capacity reflected robust cash generation by our business and of course, additional capacities from the closing of the sale of our pharmacy business in December. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our 2015 spending reflected the retiming of certain projects resulting from prioritization efforts initiated by our new Chief Information Officer, Mike McNamara, and his team. Following his arrival in the middle of the year, Mike dramatically reduced the number of non-infrastructure technology projects in order to refocus resources on the highest-priority initiatives and make faster progress. 
In addition, Mike's team began hiring hundreds of additional engineers in order to reduce our reliance on contractors and vendors. These changes reflect our commitment to prioritize spending on both capital and expense to best support our enterprise priorities. And in the current environment, our spending priorities are currently tilting towards expense, including investments in technology engineers; in our store team, including the hiring of visual merchants; and in our headquarters teams, in the areas of data science and operational excellence. 
So how did the elements of our 2015 P&L translate into adjusted EPS? By achieving our comp sales goal, while exceeding our guidance for profit margin and share repurchase, we delivered $4.69 of adjusted EPS this year, above our guidance range of $4.45 to $4.65 and more than 11% higher than 2014. 
And while we didn't provide specific guidance for return on invested capital in 2015, we reported after-tax ROIC of 16% this year. I'll quickly note, because the ROIC calculation doesn't adjust for nonrecurring items, this year's performance included the gain on the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding this gain, our business generated a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 13.9% for the year, up well over a percentage point from 2014. 
So with full year 2015 performance as context, let's turn to our detailed guidance for first quarter. I will also provide some high-level details of our plan for the year and discuss those plans in more detail at our meeting next week. 
I'll start with our view of comparable sales for the full year. We are planning for comp growth in the 1.5% to 2.5% range in 2016, consistent with our performance throughout last year. Given that we're 1 year into a multiyear journey, at next week's meeting, I'll discuss why we believe we have the capacity to grow comps a bit faster than this range over time. However, in the current environment, we believe this is a prudent range to plan for this next year. 
With that context on full year sales, I'll turn to the first quarter. As we plan our first quarter comp in light of competitor inventory positions, we're anticipating growth in the lower end of the 1.5% to 2.5% range we're planning for the full year. First quarter reported total sales are expected to decline 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales from this year's results. 
One note on our sales guidance. We haven't specified a goal for digital sales growth. I'll discuss our reasoning for this change in more detail next week, but for now, I'll simply stress that our commitment to digital is as strong as ever. And while we will continue to include digital metrics in our financial reporting this year, we are going to gauge our success based on Target's overall traffic and sales growth without making an arbitrary distinction between channels. This change is consistent with how our guests think about shopping as we've confirmed with our guest research. 
Moving on to the first quarter P&L. On the EBITDA margin rate, we are expecting an improvement of 50 to 70 basis points in the first quarter, driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a moderate increase in SG&A expense rate. The expected gross margin rate improvement primarily reflects the benefit of the removal of low-margin pharmacy sales from the mix, combined with a moderate improvement in the underlying business. 
On the SG&A line, our forecast anticipates some pressure from the investments we're making in our store themes, along with incremental expense from the reissuance of REDcard debit and credit cards as we move guests to much more secure chip-and-PIN technology. 
On the depreciation and amortization expense line, we are expecting 20 to 30 basis points of pressure in the first quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales and a slight increase in D&A dollars over last year. We expect first quarter interest rate -- interest expense dollars to be flat to last year's. We're planning for a first quarter effective income tax rate of 35% to 36%, and we expect to continue to engage in meaningful share repurchase given our cash position. 
Altogether, these expectations position us to deliver first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 compared with $1.10 a year ago. 
Turning back to full year. We expect to deliver full year 2016 adjusted EPS of $5.20 to $5.40, and I'll provide more detail on the individual P&L items next week. 
For now, I would note that this performance would exceed our longer-term financial algorithm to generate annual adjusted EPS growth of about 10% as it reflects the expected share repurchase benefit of the incremental cash we deploy -- we'll deploy from the sale of our pharmacy business. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who is going to provide a quick preview of next week's financial community meeting. Brian?"

Why don't I start by talking about the promotional environment, and we approach every year recognizing that the fourth quarter, this holiday season, is a very important time of the year for us and it's going to be a very promotional environment. And as we sit here today, we really believe our playbook that we rolled out during the holiday drove traffic to our stores, drove traffic to our site, allowed us to accelerate our comp performance. And remember, we were comping a very strong Q4 from 2014. So we felt very good about the effectiveness of our promotions. They were broad, they were very simple, and they worked both in-store and online. So we feel great about the performance during the holiday where our signature categories performed well. We've worked with Nielsen and NPD to look at market share performance and clearly recognize that we gain market share as a by-product of our playbook in the fourth quarter. So we feel very good about our approach. But to your question about the future, we're always setting back and analyzing promotional effectiveness, looking back at our playbook. And as we plan for next year, we'll continue to enhance and refine and make sure that we have very broad, very simple and very effective offers that continue to drive traffic and profitably grow our sales.

What I think is much more important, when you talk about essential categories, ultimately, this is about the guest trusting that you will have the merchandise they want when they come in our stores. If a new mom takes her baby out in 10-degree weather for diapers and formula, you better have diapers and formula in your store. And so really, it's about the trust that they have in the Target brand to always deliver wherever and whenever they want. And over time, there is no doubt in our minds that, that will drive sales growth for the long term."

So we felt really good about the way the guest responded to our offers during the fourth quarter. And a great combination of in-store traffic, more guests than ever before clicking and collecting items in our store and then the fact that we were able to leverage our stores, this year over 460, where we were shipping from stores to our guests' homes, that overall package came together really effectively throughout the holidays. So we feel as if we had a winning strategy in the holidays. It drove great comps on top of a very strong performance last year. And you and many of the others that are on the call have asked me repeatedly throughout 2015, will we be able to comp the 3.8% increase in 2014? Well, hopefully, we answered that question.

As we look back at both the fourth quarter and the year, we are very pleased with the progress we made throughout 2015. 
Traffic increased in all 4 quarters, and the team delivered on our comparable sales and operating margin rate goals by driving rapid growth in our signature categories. And our full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 was above the top of the range we provided last March, keeping us on track to deliver our longer-term financial goals. In the fourth quarter, our business generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up $0.03 from a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Comp sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter, building on a 3.8% increase in last year's fourth quarter. 
Target's great store experience, unique items at an unbeatable value and broad, simple promotions resonated with our guests and drove this growth. Transactions, our measure of traffic, increased for the fifth quarter in a row, up 1.3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all of our selling channels. Digital sales increased an industry-leading 34% in the fourth quarter, on top of 36% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks drove this increase. In fact, after setting a new digital daily sales record in the week of Black Friday, we shattered all previous records on Cyber Monday. Our offer was broad and simple, 15% off everything on our site, and the guest response was exceptionally strong. 
Our holiday season merchandising and marketing plans were focused on delivering broad, simple and compelling offers, like our 10 Days of Deals, Black Friday doorbusters and the site-wide offer on Cyber Monday and the bounce-back coupon we offered to guests in our stores on Black Friday, all supported by cohesive marketing plans featuring outstanding creative work. This plan delivered record sales over the November and December period, driven by comp sales in our signature categories: Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, which grew nearly 7% over that 2-month period.  Sales in Kids were particularly strong, with the fastest growth in Toys and Kids Home products. In Style, we saw the fastest growth in women's apparel, led by double-digit increases in ready-to-wear. And in Wellness, wearable electronics and Food led the way. 
Across our traditional category destinations, Apparel grew in the low single-digit range. In Hardlines, Toys grew comp sales more than 10% in the quarter, marking the third quarter of double-digit comp growth in Toys. This strength helped offset a sales decline in Electronics, where sales benefited from robust growth in wearables but also reflected the impact of industry-wide softness in tablets. Consistent with the third quarter, fourth quarter comp sales in Food grew faster than our overall sales, outpacing trends in the first half of the year, validating the changes we're making to the assortment, presentation and freshness. And finally, Home grew about 4% in the fourth quarter. With this performance, Home delivered a 4% comp sales increase for the full year, the strongest annual performance in this category in more than 10 years. 
Finally, prior to the holiday season, we reimagined the See. Spot. Save. area in the front of our stores, which is large and a very profitable business, and transformed it into Bullseye's Playground. We modernized the environment, making it easier to navigate, more appealing and fun, incorporating our much-loved mascot into store displays. While we love the new look, our guest reaction is what really matters, and the fourth quarter results showed they loved it too as comp sales in Bullseye's Playground grew more than 25% compared to See. Spot. Save. in the fourth quarter of last year. 
December marked an important milestone for the company as we closed on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. Our team has been working closely with our colleagues at CVS, both before and after the sale, to ensure this transition is seamless for our team members and our guests. And while the transition is not yet complete, we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far. A small number of our store pharmacies have already been rebranded as CVS locations, and over the next 6 months, we'll complete the rebranding of all our pharmacies and clinics in stores across the country. We believe this transaction will create value for our guests, providing them access to the capabilities of a best-in-class health care provider while they're shopping our stores. And we expect both Target and CVS to benefit from this transaction, allowing both companies to leverage their respective strengths. Importantly, we believe CVS will be able to grow traffic in our store pharmacies faster than we would have been able to do on our own, given our lack of scale when we ran this business. In addition to the ongoing value we'd expect to realize from this arrangement, the sale has already provided more than $1 billion of net cash that we'll use in support of our capital deployment priorities. 
Turning to capital deployment. We generated very strong cash flow in 2015, which we deployed for the benefit of our shareholders. Beyond funding capital investments in support of our strategic and financial goals, in 2015, we returned nearly $5 billion through dividends and share repurchase, well ahead of the goal we set at the beginning of the year. Even with this robust return of cash, we ended this year with a very healthy cash balance, positioning Target for another strong year in 2016. 
Now before I turn the call over to John, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for what they accomplished in 2015. As I look back to a year ago, I believe we're operating on a much stronger foundation today. And while we've got much more to accomplish on this journey, the team today is agile and aligned around a small set of key enterprise priorities, allowing us to move much more quickly. 
Today, the team is taking an outside-in approach to our work, understanding how Target fits into the consumer and retail environment as we work to grow the company on behalf of our guests. When Cathy began working with us last year, her first observation was how talented this team is and how passionate they are about both Target and our guests. Not surprisingly, that was my first observation when I arrived at Target in 2014 and something I know John has experienced throughout his career with this great company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's progress in efforts to improve our operations. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations, and I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. 
Our work to reduce out-of-stocks is continuing to pay off as metrics improved sequentially from the third quarter and even more dramatically when compared with the fourth quarter a year ago. Specifically, for the fourth quarter in total, out-of-stock metrics were 20% better than last year. And notably, by the end of the quarter, Target's out-of-stock metrics were 40% better than a year ago as the improvements we've implemented allowed for a faster post-holiday recovery this year.  We saw out-of-stock improvements across every category in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in the last conference call, our work has been focused primarily on essential items for which reliability is particularly important for our guests, and I'm really happy with our progress. 
For the set of focused items we've designated in essentials, our out-of-stock metrics are better than we have ever measured. While this progress is exciting, I'm even more pleased with -- that this improvement has been accomplished through systematic and therefore sustainable changes. In other words, this isn't an example of temporarily adding resources to work around systems and processes. Rather, this is a case of making improvements to those systems and processes to support a sustainable improvement in performance. 
Because upstream variability in the supply chain hampers our ability to keep our stores in stock and provide tight shipping windows to our guests, a key pillar of the team's work is focused on improving freight flow through the supply chain. As part of this effort, the team has created smart, systematic rules governing safety stock in distribution centers and they have optimized pick frequencies on priority items. In the fourth quarter, the team began an array of tests to reduce variability of inbound shipments at our DCs, with a goal of reducing inbound variability by 50%. Similarly, the team plans to engage in tests to optimize outbound volatility, which will further improve overall freight flow. While we are still early in this journey, the team's work on flow was a key reason we saw a much faster recovery this holiday season and why we entered 2016 with a much better in-stock position than a year ago. 
Beyond in-stocks, we are entering 2016 with very little clearance inventory even compared to a strong position a year ago. As you'll recall, last year's fourth quarter sales were much stronger than expected as we planned for a 2% comp and ended up with growth nearly twice as high. With last year's unexpectedly strong sales, we saw very high sell-through percentages on Seasonal merchandise. However, as a result of great product and of the changes we've implemented this year, quarter end sell-throughs on Seasonal merchandise were slightly better than last year, putting us in a very clean inventory position at the beginning of the year. These are just a few examples of the team's work to implement quick solutions that are already having a tangible impact on our results. At the same time, we are working to build capabilities that will support our future growth. I'll provide a lot more detail on these future focus efforts in my remarks at next week's meeting. 
As you know, we have been building our flexible fulfillment capabilities for several years, and this holiday season highlighted the power of these capabilities to serve our guests and drive business performance. And while we've added capacity across our entire direct-to-guest network, our fourth quarter experience demonstrated the power of relying on our stores to fill digital demand. 
This holiday season, our stores fulfilled 30% of our digital orders through the combination of order pickup and direct-to-guest shipments. On Black Friday weekend alone, our stores fulfilled more than 1 million digital orders. And even though the traditional view of Cyber Monday doesn't even include brick-and-mortar, Target stores set an all-time record for order pickup on that day, with more than 4x the volume compared with last year. And like last year, order pickup became even more important in the days leading up to Christmas, growing to half our digital volume. 
While our stores help us save meaningfully on shipping costs and allow us to fulfill guest demand faster, they also help us capture more sales. Because we now have a single view of inventory encompassing all of our distribution center and store locations, we can rely on our entire network when fulfilling digital orders, keeping us in stock on a greater percentage of digital orders. Specifically, during the holiday season, about 40% of our order pickup and store-shipped volume consisted of items that were out of stock in our web fulfillment centers. This preserved sales on orders we would have otherwise missed had we only accessed inventory in our web fulfillment centers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I also want to provide an update on our decision to bring visual merchandising talent into our stores. Last fall, we announced we were filling more than 1,400 new visual merchant positions in our store organization. In scoping responsibilities for these roles, we benchmarked industry leaders to define the necessary capabilities and enhanced our interview process to better assess for these skills when interviewing potential candidates. The majority of these positions have been filled by external candidates with experience at other retailers, but we have also tapped in the talent that we identified within the organization. 
Our visual merchants are focused on Style categories in our Home, Apparel and Seasonal areas, and they are trained to rely on sales and inventory data while developing compelling visual presentations in our stores. As a result, their job requires that they balance art with science and productivity with creativity. And because of their unique qualifications, this team is responsible for training their store team colleagues to understand the latest product trends so the entire store team can better assist our guests as they shop our stores. While the visual merchandising team is just ramping up its processes and tools, we can already see the early impact of their effort in our store displays, and we are very excited about the potential of this effort to elevate both signature categories and our store experience. 
Thinking back to the year just ended, it's amazing for me to realize that we only formed our new operations team about 6 months ago. In that time, we have already seen meaningful improvement in our operations and we're entering the year with a much stronger in-stock position than a year ago. As we look ahead, we see multiple opportunities to improve end-to-end processes and build the foundation for our future growth while improving the shopping experience for our guests and enhancing our business results. I look forward to discussing these opportunities with you in New York next week. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our fourth quarter financial performance. Cathy?"

As Brian mentioned earlier, we are really pleased that our team delivered strong traffic and sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our financial results continue to validate the strategic changes we've made, confirming that we are focused on what's most important to our guests. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 was well within our guidance range and up $0.03 from last year's very strong performance. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.31 was $0.79 above adjusted EPS, reflecting the $620 million pretax gain on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. Comparable sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter on top of a 3.8% increase in 2014. Traffic was the primary driver of our comp growth, up 1.3%, building on a really strong 3.2% increase last year. This quarter marked our fifth straight quarter of traffic growth, and we are committed to driving continued traffic growth in 2016 and beyond. 
As I mentioned last quarter, results in our fourth quarter 2014 reflected a bounce-back from the impact of the breach in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, even on a 3-year stacked basis, our traffic was stronger in this year's fourth quarter than earlier in the year, demonstrating continued momentum from the strategic changes we've implemented. One note. Fourth quarter reported sales were down a little less than 1% from last year, reflecting our comp sales increase, offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business, which closed in mid-December. 
Digital sales grew 34% in the fourth quarter, and we saw the most dramatic increases in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks. These increases were driven by our simple, broad and compelling offers, and as John mentioned, our flexible fulfillment capabilities played a key role in driving our fourth quarter digital sales growth. 
REDcard penetration was 23% in the fourth quarter, up about 190 basis points from 21.1% last year. This increase represents a moderate acceleration from the trends we were seeing earlier in the year, combined with the impact of the removal of our pharmacy sales. Because a meaningful portion of our pharmacy sales consisted of reimbursements from third parties, REDcard penetration on our total pharmacy sales was very low. As a result, the pharmacy sale will increase REDcard penetration throughout 2016, and to add clarity, we've provided an apples-to-apples comparison in our press release schedules. For the fourth quarter, REDcard penetration would have been up about 160 basis points from last year had pharmacy sales been removed from both years. 
Our fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 9.8% was flat to last year's strong performance. Among the drivers, fourth quarter gross margin rate was down about 50 basis points from last year, reflecting a small benefit from sales mix, including the removal of pharmacy sales, offset by investments in promotions. As John mentioned earlier, last year's stronger-than-expected comparable sales growth drove very strong gross margin rate performance in fourth quarter 2014 as regular priced selling on Seasonal items was unusually high. This year, with sales in line with our expectations, our gross margin rate reverted to a more normal level, given the competitive dynamics we faced in the fourth quarter. 
Every holiday season, we gain insights into the evolution of our guests' shopping behavior, and this year's results showed us that clear, compelling, broad-based offers are appealing to our guests. This insight will inform our strategy as we work to further refine our promotional effectiveness in 2016. 
Favorability in our selling, general and administrative expense rate offset the fourth quarter gross margin rate decline. This performance reflected an increase in our store Apparel expense rate, driven by investments in our store team, including the visual merchants John mentioned earlier, partially offset by underlying improvement in unit productivity. However, the pressure from store labor expense was offset by favorability in our marketing and bonus expense rates and disciplined spending across the organization.  At the end of the year, our merchandise inventory was up about 4% from a year ago, a bit more than our current sales trends. As John mentioned, we ended the year with a very clean inventory position, and the year-over-year increase reflects intentional inventory investments, which are supporting record in-stock levels in our focus categories. 
Turning now to capital deployment. We paid dividends of $345 million in the fourth quarter, up 4.4% from a year ago. Our business results and cash position also enabled $1.3 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter, meaning we returned more than 110% of our net income through dividends and share repurchases.  And even though we returned about $4.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015, we ended the year with a healthy cash position, including cash from the CVS transaction, which closed late in the year. 
Before I turn to our guidance for the first quarter and provide some insights of our financial plan for the year, I want to review last year's performance against the guidance we provided a year ago. Let's start with sales. A year ago, we laid out a plan to grow total sales 2% to 3% on comp sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, led by growth in our signature categories. We achieved our comp sales goal by generating very solid growth of 2.1%, and comp growth in signature categories was more than 2.5x as high as our comparable sales growth overall. 
Total sales grew slower than comps this year due to the removal of the pharmacy sales beginning in December. Of course, the sale of the pharmacy business was not reflected in our guidance a year ago as we didn't enter into the deal until June. However, while the sale of the pharmacy business will continue to affect our total sales this year, we first articulated the expected benefits of the deal in June, which includes faster traffic growth, higher profit dollars and rates and higher ROIC from the upfront capital we received from CVS. 
Now let's turn to digital. A year ago, we laid out a goal to grow Target's digital sales an industry-leading 40%. And while we didn't quite make this ambitious goal, we did lead the industry with 31% digital sales growth in 2015. With this growth, we delivered our financial goals and we gained deeper insights into how our guests want to interact with Target. 
Moving down the P&L. A year ago, we said we expected to grow our segment EBITDA rate 20 to 30 basis points in 2015, given -- driven by modest improvements in both our gross margin and our SG&A expense rate. We ended the year ahead of that goal, up about 50 basis points, reflecting favorability on both the gross margin and the SG&A expense lines. 
Turning to capital deployment. A year ago, we were expecting 2015 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion, planning for a 5% to 10% increase in the quarterly dividend in the middle of the year, and we expected $2 billion or more in share repurchases for the full year.  How did the year turn out? We spent about $1.4 billion on capital expenditures in 2015. We hit the middle of our guidance with a board-approved 7.7% dividend increase in June. And we exceeded our share repurchase guidance with about $3.4 billion in shares retired this year. Our 2015 share repurchase capacity reflected robust cash generation by our business and, of course, additional capacity from the closing of the sale of our pharmacy business in December. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our 2015 spending reflected the retiming of certain projects resulting from prioritization efforts initiated by our new Chief Information Officer, Mike McNamara, and his team. Following his arrival in the middle of the year, Mike dramatically reduced the number of non-infrastructure technology projects in order to refocus resources on the highest-priority initiatives and make faster progress. 
In addition, Mike's team began hiring hundreds of additional engineers in order to reduce our reliance on contractors and vendors. These changes reflect our commitment to prioritize spending on both capital and expense to best support our enterprise priorities. And in the current environment, our spending priorities are currently tilting towards expense, including investments in technology engineers; in our store team, including the hiring of visual merchants; and in our headquarters teams, in the areas of data science and operational excellence. 
So how did the elements of our 2015 P&L translate into adjusted EPS? By achieving our comp sales goal, while exceeding our guidance for profit margin and share repurchase, we delivered $4.69 of adjusted EPS this year, above our guidance range of $4.45 to $4.65 and more than 11% higher than 2014. And while we didn't provide specific guidance for return on invested capital in 2015, we reported after-tax ROIC of 16% this year. I'll quickly note, because the ROIC calculation doesn't adjust for nonrecurring items, this year's performance included the gain on the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding this gain, our business generated a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 13.9% for the year, up well over a percentage point from 2014. 
So with full year 2015 performance as context, let's turn to our detailed guidance for first quarter. I will also provide some high-level details of our plan for the year and discuss those plans in more detail at our meeting next week. I'll start with our view of comparable sales for the full year. We are planning for comp growth in the 1.5% to 2.5% range in 2016, consistent with our performance throughout last year. Given that we're 1 year into a multiyear journey, at next week's meeting, I'll discuss why we believe we have the capacity to grow comps a bit faster than this range over time. However, in the current environment, we believe this is a prudent range to plan for this next year. 
With that context on full year sales, I'll turn to the first quarter. As we plan our first quarter comp in light of competitor inventory positions, we're anticipating growth in the lower end of the 1.5% to 2.5% range we're planning for the full year. First quarter reported total sales are expected to decline 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales from this year's results. 
One note on our sales guidance. We haven't specified a goal for digital sales growth. I'll discuss our reasoning for this change in more detail next week, but for now, I'll simply stress that our commitment to digital is as strong as ever. And while we will continue to include digital metrics in our financial reporting this year, we are going to gauge our success based on Target's overall traffic and sales growth without making an arbitrary distinction between channels. This change is consistent with how our guests think about shopping as we've confirmed with our guest research. 
Moving on to the first quarter P&L. On the EBITDA margin rate, we are expecting an improvement of 60 to 70 basis points in the first quarter, driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a moderate increase in SG&A expense rate. The expected gross margin rate improvement primarily reflects the benefit of the removal of low-margin pharmacy sales from the mix, combined with a moderate improvement in the underlying business. On the SG&A line, our forecast anticipates some pressure from the investments we're making in our store themes, along with incremental expense from the reissuance of REDcard debit and credit cards as we move guests to much more secure chip-and-PIN technology. 
On the depreciation and amortization expense line, we are expecting 20 to 30 basis points of pressure in the first quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales and a slight increase in D&A dollars over last year. We expect first quarter interest expense dollars to be flat to last year's. We're planning for a first quarter effective income tax rate of 35% to 36%, and we expect to continue to engage in meaningful share repurchase given our cash position.  Altogether, these expectations position us to deliver first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 compared with $1.10 a year ago. 
Turning back to full year. We expect to deliver full year 2016 adjusted EPS of $5.20 to $5.40, and I'll provide more detail on the individual P&L items next week.  For now, I would note that this performance would exceed our longer-term financial algorithm to generate annual adjusted EPS growth of about 10% as it reflects the expected share repurchase benefit of the incremental cash we deploy -- will deploy from the sale of our pharmacy business. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who is going to provide a quick preview of next week's financial community meeting. Brian?"

Our priorities today remain consistent with a year ago. We made progress, but we have a lot more to do. And our tactics will always be evolving, but this year's results demonstrate we're focused on the right work. 
At this year's meeting, we plan to show you how we're getting even closer to our guests, gaining a deeper understanding of their wants and needs and how Target fits into their daily lives. We also plan to show you why we're so excited about all the new products we've developed for this year. And for those of you who will be with us in New York, you'll see vignettes showcasing newly developed products across multiple categories, including our incredible new Kids brand, Pillowfort. So whether you plan to be with us in New York next week or listening to our webcast, we hope you'll join us to gain a deeper understanding of our strategic and financial plans going forward and why we're so excited about the prospects in 2016.

With regards to our performance with SG&A, the beauty of what we're seeing with the plan we laid out last year is we're delivering upon it, but we're also recognizing how we can reinvest back in the business on the priorities that matter to our guests. And so if you think about our investment in visual merchandise leaders, that's a great example. 1,400 stores now have someone who is an expert at helping to showcase the categories that matter most to our guests. And so we're seeing the ability as we save on one line, we can invest in other areas in our business. And you had asked about wage pressure. I'm going to just put a plug in. We believe in having the best team in retail, and that has always been a differentiator for Target and we believe more today than ever that, that is going to be a differentiator, is that it's our wonderful team member engagement with our guests every single day, any way they interact with them. So we're going to be competitive in wage. We always assess it market by market and because we believe in fielding that best team in retail."

So we felt really good about the way the guest responded to our offers during the fourth quarter. And a great combination of in-store traffic, more guests than ever before clicking and collecting items in our store and then the fact that we were able to leverage our stores, this year over 460, where we were shipping from stores to our guests' homes, that overall package came together really effectively throughout the holidays. So we feel as if we had a winning strategy in the holidays. It drove great comps on top of a very strong performance last year. And you and many of the others that are on the call have asked me repeatedly throughout 2015, would we be able to comp the 3.8% increase in 2014? Well, hopefully, we answered that question. We answered it with strong momentum, and we were able to see both strong performance in our stores and we delivered industry-leading performance online.

On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance, including results across our merchandise categories. Then John will provide an update on our efforts to improve in-stocks and build our supply chain capabilities. And finally, Cathy will offer more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.

Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure; and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, one note, given that we're hosting our financial community meeting next week, our remarks today will focus on Target's fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016. At next week's meeting, we will provide insights into our strategy and priorities and how they will drive our financial performance in 2016 and beyond. As a result, we are shortening today's call to 45 minutes, and we'll look forward to spending another couple hours with all of you, either online or in person, at next week's meeting in New York.

As we look back at both the fourth quarter and the year, we are very pleased with the progress we made throughout 2015. 
Traffic increased in all 4 quarters, and the team delivered on our comparable sales and operating margin rate goals by driving rapid growth in our signature categories. And our full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 was above the top of the range we provided last March, keeping us on track to deliver our longer-term financial goals. In the fourth quarter, our business generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up $0.03 from a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Comp sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter, building on a 3.8% increase in last year's fourth quarter. 
Target's great store experience, unique items at an unbeatable value and broad, simple promotions resonated with our guests and drove this growth. Transactions, our measure of traffic, increased for the fifth quarter in a row, up 1.3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all of our selling channels. Digital sales increased an industry-leading 34% in the fourth quarter, on top of 36% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks drove this increase. In fact, after setting a new digital daily sales record in the week of Black Friday, we shattered all previous records on Cyber Monday. Our offer was broad and simple, 15% off everything on our site, and the guest response was exceptionally strong. 
Our holiday season merchandising and marketing plans were focused on delivering broad, simple and compelling offers, like our 10 Days of Deals, Black Friday doorbusters and the site-wide offer on Cyber Monday and the bounce-back coupon we offered to guests in our stores on Black Friday, all supported by cohesive marketing plans featuring outstanding creative work. This plan delivered record sales over the November and December period, driven by comp sales in our signature categories: Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, which grew nearly 7% over that 2-month period.  Sales in Kids were particularly strong, with the fastest growth in Toys and Kids Home products. In Style, we saw the fastest growth in women's apparel, led by double-digit increases in ready-to-wear. And in Wellness, wearable electronics and Food led the way. 
Across our traditional category destinations, Apparel grew in the low single-digit range. In Hardlines, Toys grew comp sales more than 10% in the quarter, marking the third quarter of double-digit comp growth in Toys. This strength helped offset a sales decline in Electronics, where sales benefited from robust growth in wearables but also reflected the impact of industry-wide softness in tablets. Consistent with the third quarter, fourth quarter comp sales in Food grew faster than our overall sales, outpacing trends in the first half of the year, validating the changes we're making to the assortment, presentation and freshness. And finally, Home grew about 4% in the fourth quarter. With this performance, Home delivered a 4% comp sales increase for the full year, the strongest annual performance in this category in more than 10 years. 
Finally, prior to the holiday season, we reimagined the See. Spot. Save. area in the front of our stores, which is large and a very profitable business, and transformed it into Bullseye's Playground. We modernized the environment, making it easier to navigate, more appealing and fun, incorporating our much-loved mascot into store displays. While we love the new look, our guest reaction is what really matters, and the fourth quarter results showed they loved it too as comp sales in Bullseye's Playground grew more than 25% compared to See. Spot. Save. in the fourth quarter of last year. 
December marked an important milestone for the company as we closed on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. Our team has been working closely with our colleagues at CVS, both before and after the sale, to ensure this transition is seamless for our team members and our guests. And while the transition is not yet complete, we're very pleased with the progress we've made so far. A small number of our store pharmacies have already been rebranded as CVS locations, and over the next 6 months, we'll complete the rebranding of all our pharmacies and clinics in stores across the country. We believe this transaction will create value for our guests, providing them access to the capabilities of a best-in-class health care provider while they're shopping our stores. And we expect both Target and CVS to benefit from this transaction, allowing both companies to leverage their respective strengths. Importantly, we believe CVS will be able to grow traffic in our store pharmacies faster than we would have been able to do on our own, given our lack of scale when we ran this business. In addition to the ongoing value we'd expect to realize from this arrangement, the sale has already provided more than $1 billion of net cash that we'll use in support of our capital deployment priorities. 
Turning to capital deployment. We generated very strong cash flow in 2015, which we deployed for the benefit of our shareholders. Beyond funding capital investments in support of our strategic and financial goals, in 2015, we returned nearly $5 billion through dividends and share repurchase, well ahead of the goal we set at the beginning of the year. Even with this robust return of cash, we ended this year with a very healthy cash balance, positioning Target for another strong year in 2016. 
Now before I turn the call over to John, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for what they accomplished in 2015. As I look back to a year ago, I believe we're operating on a much stronger foundation today. And while we've got much more to accomplish on this journey, the team today is agile and aligned around a small set of key enterprise priorities, allowing us to move much more quickly. 
Today, the team is taking an outside-in approach to our work, understanding how Target fits into the consumer and retail environment as we work to grow the company on behalf of our guests. When Cathy began working with us last year, her first observation was how talented this team is and how passionate they are about both Target and our guests. Not surprisingly, that was my first observation when I arrived at Target in 2014 and something I know John has experienced throughout his career with this great company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's progress in efforts to improve our operations. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations, and I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. Our work to reduce out-of-stocks",1178,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to provide you with a brief update on our work to improve operations, and I'll provide more detail about our strategy and future plans at the meeting next week. 
Our work to reduce out-of-stocks is continuing to pay off as metrics improved sequentially from the third quarter and even more dramatically when compared with the fourth quarter a year ago. Specifically, for the fourth quarter in total, out-of-stock metrics were 20% better than last year. And notably, by the end of the quarter, Target's out-of-stock metrics were 40% better than a year ago as the improvements we've implemented allowed for a faster post-holiday recovery this year.  We saw out-of-stock improvements across every category in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in the last conference call, our work has been focused primarily on essential items for which reliability is particularly important for our guests, and I'm really happy with our progress. 
For the set of focused items we've designated in essentials, our out-of-stock metrics are better than we have ever measured. While this progress is exciting, I'm even more pleased with -- that this improvement has been accomplished through systematic and therefore sustainable changes. In other words, this isn't an example of temporarily adding resources to work around systems and processes. Rather, this is a case of making improvements to those systems and processes to support a sustainable improvement in performance. 
Because upstream variability in the supply chain hampers our ability to keep our stores in stock and provide tight shipping windows to our guests, a key pillar of the team's work is focused on improving freight flow through the supply chain. As part of this effort, the team has created smart, systematic rules governing safety stock in distribution centers and they have optimized pick frequencies on priority items. In the fourth quarter, the team began an array of tests to reduce variability of inbound shipments at our DCs, with a goal of reducing inbound variability by 50%. Similarly, the team plans to engage in tests to optimize outbound volatility, which will further improve overall freight flow. While we are still early in this journey, the team's work on flow was a key reason we saw a much faster recovery this holiday season and why we entered 2016 with a much better in-stock position than a year ago. 
Beyond in-stocks, we are entering 2016 with very little clearance inventory even compared to a strong position a year ago. As you'll recall, last year's fourth quarter sales were much stronger than expected as we planned for a 2% comp and ended up with growth nearly twice as high. With last year's unexpectedly strong sales, we saw very high sell-through percentages on Seasonal merchandise. However, as a result of great product and of the changes we've implemented this year, quarter end sell-throughs on Seasonal merchandise were slightly better than last year, putting us in a very clean inventory position at the beginning of the year. These are just a few examples of the team's work to implement quick solutions that are already having a tangible impact on our results. At the same time, we are working to build capabilities that will support our future growth. I'll provide a lot more detail on these future focus efforts in my remarks at next week's meeting. 
As you know, we have been building our flexible fulfillment capabilities for several years, and this holiday season highlighted the power of these capabilities to serve our guests and drive business performance. And while we've added capacity across our entire direct-to-guest network, our fourth quarter experience demonstrated the power of relying on our stores to fill digital demand. 
This holiday season, our stores fulfilled 30% of our digital orders through the combination of order pickup and direct-to-guest shipments. On Black Friday weekend alone, our stores fulfilled more than 1 million digital orders. And even though the traditional view of Cyber Monday doesn't even include brick-and-mortar, Target stores set an all-time record for order pickup on that day, with more than 4x the volume compared with last year. And like last year, order pickup became even more important in the days leading up to Christmas, growing to half our digital volume. 
While our stores help us save meaningfully on shipping costs and allow us to fulfill guest demand faster, they also help us capture more sales. Because we now have a single view of inventory encompassing all of our distribution center and store locations, we can rely on our entire network when fulfilling digital orders, keeping us in stock on a greater percentage of digital orders. Specifically, during the holiday season, about 40% of our order pickup and store-shipped volume consisted of items that were out of stock in our web fulfillment centers. This preserved sales on orders we would have otherwise missed had we only accessed inventory in our web fulfillment centers. 
Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I also want to provide an update on our decision to bring visual merchandising talent into our stores. Last fall, we announced we were filling more than 1,400 new visual merchant positions in our store organization. In scoping responsibilities for these roles, we benchmarked industry leaders to define the necessary capabilities and enhanced our interview process to better assess for these skills when interviewing potential candidates. The majority of these positions have been filled by external candidates with experience at other retailers, but we have also tapped in the talent that we identified within the organization. 
Our visual merchants are focused on Style categories in our Home, Apparel and Seasonal areas, and they are trained to rely on sales and inventory data while developing compelling visual presentations in our stores. As a result, their job requires that they balance art with science and productivity with creativity. And because of their unique qualifications, this team is responsible for training their store team colleagues to understand the latest product trends so the entire store team can better assist our guests as they shop our stores. While the visual merchandising team is just ramping up its processes and tools, we can already see the early impact of their effort in our store displays, and we are very excited about the potential of this effort to elevate both signature categories and our store experience. 
Thinking back to the year just ended, it's amazing for me to realize that we only formed our new operations team about 6 months ago. In that time, we have already seen meaningful improvement in our operations and we're entering the year with a much stronger in-stock position than a year ago. As we look ahead, we see multiple opportunities to improve end-to-end processes and build the foundation for our future growth while improving the shopping experience for our guests and enhancing our business results. I look forward to discussing these opportunities with you in New York next week. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our fourth quarter financial performance. Cathy?"

Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 was well within our guidance range and up $0.03 from last year's very strong performance. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.31 was $0.79 above adjusted EPS, reflecting the $620 million pretax gain on the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS Health. Comparable sales grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter on top of a 3.8% increase in 2014. Traffic was the primary driver of our comp growth, up 1.3%, building on a really strong 3.2% increase last year. This quarter marked our fifth straight quarter of traffic growth, and we are committed to driving continued traffic growth in 2016 and beyond. 
As I mentioned last quarter, results in our fourth quarter 2014 reflected a bounce-back from the impact of the breach in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, even on a 3-year stacked basis, our traffic was stronger in this year's fourth quarter than earlier in the year, demonstrating continued momentum from the strategic changes we've implemented. One note. Fourth quarter reported sales were down a little less than 1% from last year, reflecting our comp sales increase, offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business, which closed in mid-December. 
Digital sales grew 34% in the fourth quarter, and we saw the most dramatic increases in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks. These increases were driven by our simple, broad and compelling offers, and as John mentioned, our flexible fulfillment capabilities played a key role in driving our fourth quarter digital sales growth. 
REDcard penetration was 23% in the fourth quarter, up about 190 basis points from 21.1% last year. This increase represents a moderate acceleration from the trends we were seeing earlier in the year, combined with the impact of the removal of our pharmacy sales. Because a meaningful portion of our pharmacy sales consisted of reimbursements from third parties, REDcard penetration on our total pharmacy sales was very low. As a result, the pharmacy sale will increase REDcard penetration throughout 2016, and to add clarity, we've provided an apples-to-apples comparison in our press release schedules. For the fourth quarter, REDcard penetration would have been up about 160 basis points from last year had pharmacy sales been removed from both years. 
Our fourth quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 9.8% was flat to last year's strong performance. Among the drivers, fourth quarter gross margin rate was down about 50 basis points from last year, reflecting a small benefit from sales mix, including the removal of pharmacy sales, offset by investments in promotions. As John mentioned earlier, last year's stronger-than-expected comparable sales growth drove very strong gross margin rate performance in fourth quarter 2014 as regular priced selling on Seasonal items was unusually high. This year, with sales in line with our expectations, our gross margin rate reverted to a more normal level, given the competitive dynamics we faced in the fourth quarter. 
Every holiday season, we gain insights into the evolution of our guests' shopping behavior, and this year's results showed us that clear, compelling, broad-based offers are appealing to our guests. This insight will inform our strategy as we work to further refine our promotional effectiveness in 2016. 
Favorability in our selling, general and administrative expense rate offset the fourth quarter gross margin rate decline. This performance reflected an increase in our store Apparel expense rate, driven by investments in our store team, including the visual merchants John mentioned earlier, partially offset by underlying improvement in unit productivity. However, the pressure from store labor expense was offset by favorability in our marketing and bonus expense rates and disciplined spending across the organization.  At the end of the year, our merchandise inventory was up about 4% from a year ago, a bit more than our current sales trends. As John mentioned, we ended the year with a very clean inventory position, and the year-over-year increase reflects intentional inventory investments, which are supporting record in-stock levels in our focus categories. 
Turning now to capital deployment. We paid dividends of $345 million in the fourth quarter, up 4.4% from a year ago. Our business results and cash position also enabled $1.3 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter, meaning we returned more than 110% of our net income through dividends and share repurchases.  And even though we returned about $4.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015, we ended the year with a healthy cash position, including cash from the CVS transaction, which closed late in the year. 
Before I turn to our guidance for the first quarter and provide some insights of our financial plan for the year, I want to review last year's performance against the guidance we provided a year ago. Let's start with sales. A year ago, we laid out a plan to grow total sales 2% to 3% on comp sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, led by growth in our signature categories. We achieved our comp sales goal by generating very solid growth of 2.1%, and comp growth in signature categories was more than 2.5x as high as our comparable sales growth overall. 
Total sales grew slower than comps this year due to the removal of the pharmacy sales beginning in December. Of course, the sale of the pharmacy business was not reflected in our guidance a year ago as we didn't enter into the deal until June. However, while the sale of the pharmacy business will continue to affect our total sales this year, we first articulated the expected benefits of the deal in June, which includes faster traffic growth, higher profit dollars and rates and higher ROIC from the upfront capital we received from CVS. 
Now let's turn to digital. A year ago, we laid out a goal to grow Target's digital sales an industry-leading 40%. And while we didn't quite make this ambitious goal, we did lead the industry with 31% digital sales growth in 2015. With this growth, we delivered our financial goals and we gained deeper insights into how our guests want to interact with Target. 
Moving down the P&L. A year ago, we said we expected to grow our segment EBITDA rate 20 to 30 basis points in 2015, given -- driven by modest improvements in both our gross margin and our SG&A expense rate. We ended the year ahead of that goal, up about 50 basis points, reflecting favorability on both the gross margin and the SG&A expense lines. 
Turning to capital deployment. A year ago, we were expecting 2015 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion, planning for a 5% to 10% increase in the quarterly dividend in the middle of the year, and we expected $2 billion or more in share repurchases for the full year.  How did the year turn out? We spent about $1.4 billion on capital expenditures in 2015. We hit the middle of our guidance with a board-approved 7.7% dividend increase in June. And we exceeded our share repurchase guidance with about $3.4 billion in shares retired this year. Our 2015 share repurchase capacity reflected robust cash generation by our business and, of course, additional capacity from the closing of the sale of our pharmacy business in December. 
Regarding capital expenditures, our 2015 spending reflected the retiming of certain projects resulting from prioritization efforts initiated by our new Chief Information Officer, Mike McNamara, and his team. Following his arrival in the middle of the year, Mike dramatically reduced the number of non-infrastructure technology projects in order to refocus resources on the highest-priority initiatives and make faster progress. 
In addition, Mike's team began hiring hundreds of additional engineers in order to reduce our reliance on contractors and vendors. These changes reflect our commitment to prioritize spending on both capital and expense to best support our enterprise priorities. And in the current environment, our spending priorities are currently tilting towards expense, including investments in technology engineers; in our store team, including the hiring of visual merchants; and in our headquarters teams, in the areas of data science and operational excellence. 
So how did the elements of our 2015 P&L translate into adjusted EPS? By achieving our comp sales goal, while exceeding our guidance for profit margin and share repurchase, we delivered $4.69 of adjusted EPS this year, above our guidance range of $4.45 to $4.65 and more than 11% higher than 2014. And while we didn't provide specific guidance for return on invested capital in 2015, we reported after-tax ROIC of 16% this year. I'll quickly note, because the ROIC calculation doesn't adjust for nonrecurring items, this year's performance included the gain on the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding this gain, our business generated a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 13.9% for the year, up well over a percentage point from 2014. 
So with full year 2015 performance as context, let's turn to our detailed guidance for first quarter. I will also provide some high-level details of our plan for the year and discuss those plans in more detail at our meeting next week. I'll start with our view of comparable sales for the full year. We are planning for comp growth in the 1.5% to 2.5% range in 2016, consistent with our performance throughout last year. Given that we're 1 year into a multiyear journey, at next week's meeting, I'll discuss why we believe we have the capacity to grow comps a bit faster than this range over time. However, in the current environment, we believe this is a prudent range to plan for this next year. 
With that context on full year sales, I'll turn to the first quarter. As we plan our first quarter comp in light of competitor inventory positions, we're anticipating growth in the lower end of the 1.5% to 2.5% range we're planning for the full year. First quarter reported total sales are expected to decline 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales from this year's results. 
One note on our sales guidance. We haven't specified a goal for digital sales growth. I'll discuss our reasoning for this change in more detail next week, but for now, I'll simply stress that our commitment to digital is as strong as ever. And while we will continue to include digital metrics in our financial reporting this year, we are going to gauge our success based on Target's overall traffic and sales growth without making an arbitrary distinction between channels. This change is consistent with how our guests think about shopping as we've confirmed with our guest research. 
Moving on to the first quarter P&L. On the EBITDA margin rate, we are expecting an improvement of 60 to 70 basis points in the first quarter, driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a moderate increase in SG&A expense rate. The expected gross margin rate improvement primarily reflects the benefit of the removal of low-margin pharmacy sales from the mix, combined with a moderate improvement in the underlying business. On the SG&A line, our forecast anticipates some pressure from the investments we're making in our store themes, along with incremental expense from the reissuance of REDcard debit and credit cards as we move guests to much more secure chip-and-PIN technology. 
On the depreciation and amortization expense line, we are expecting 20 to 30 basis points of pressure in the first quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy sales and a slight increase in D&A dollars over last year. We expect first quarter interest expense dollars to be flat to last year's. We're planning for a first quarter effective income tax rate of 35% to 36%, and we expect to continue to engage in meaningful share repurchase given our cash position.  Altogether, these expectations position us to deliver first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 compared with $1.10 a year ago. 
Turning back to full year. We expect to deliver full year 2016 adjusted EPS of $5.20 to $5.40, and I'll provide more detail on the individual P&L items next week.  For now, I would note that this performance would exceed our longer-term financial algorithm to generate annual adjusted EPS growth of about 10% as it reflects the expected share repurchase benefit of the incremental cash we deploy -- will deploy from the sale of our pharmacy business. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who is going to provide a quick preview of next week's financial community meeting. Brian?"

Following the presentations, we'll have a Q&A session with all 3 speakers, along with several other members of our leadership team who will be attending this meeting. At last year's meeting, I outlined our enterprise priorities and told you that I hoped it would remain consistent for years. So here's the spoiler alert. Our priorities today remain consistent with a year ago. We made progress, but we have a lot more to do. And our tactics will always be evolving, but this year's results demonstrate we're focused on the right work. 
At this year's meeting, we plan to show you how we're getting even closer to our guests, gaining a deeper understanding of their wants and needs and how Target fits into their daily lives. We also plan to show you why we're so excited about all the new products we've developed for this year. And for those of you who will be with us in New York, you'll see vignettes showcasing newly developed products across multiple categories, including our incredible new Kids brand, Pillowfort. So whether you plan to be with us in New York next week or listening to our webcast, we hope you'll join us to gain a deeper understanding of our strategic and financial plans going forward and why we're so excited about the prospects in 2016. 
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks, and now Cathy, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

They were broad, they were very simple, and they worked both in-store and online. So we feel great about the performance during the holiday where our signature categories performed well.

We certainly heard many times, because of some of the proprietary items that we offer during the fourth quarter, they were shopping online, but as John referenced, quickly coming to our stores to pick up those items. So we felt really good about the way the guest responded to our offers during the fourth quarter. And a great combination of in-store traffic, more guests than ever before clicking and collecting items in our store and then the fact that we were able to leverage our stores, this year over 460, where we were shipping from stores to our guests' homes, that overall package came together really effectively throughout the holidays. So we feel as if we had a winning strategy in the holidays. It drove great comps on top of a very strong performance last year. And you and many of the others that are on the call have asked me repeatedly throughout 2015, would we be able to comp the 3.8% increase in 2014? Well, hopefully, we answered that question. We answered it with strong momentum, and we were able to see both strong performance in our stores and we delivered industry-leading performance online.

Before I start with prepared remarks, let me set up the structure for our call this morning. We want to make sure we spend significant time talking about our first quarter results, and Cathy and John and I will cover both our first quarter performance but also talk about the second quarter outlook, but we are going to make sure we leave significant time for Q&A. We want to make sure we have time today to address your questions, provide additional insights into our first quarter performance and the factors that are guiding our outlook for Q2. 
Let me start with the first quarter. Our team delivered outstanding first quarter financial results in a very challenging consumer environment, which became softer and more volatile as the quarter progressed. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was well beyond the high end of the guidance for the quarter and more than 16% ahead of the $1.10 last year. These results demonstrate the value of our strategy in the face of more challenging consumer landscape. 
First quarter comparable sales growth was driven by an increase in both traffic and average ticket as traffic grew in both our stores and digital channels. Comparable digital sales grew 23% in the first quarter on top of 38% a year ago. 
We generated very healthy profit margins on our sales in the quarter as our team did a great job managing the business in the face of a number of headwinds, particularly following the Easter holiday. As planned, our first quarter gross margin rate reflected the benefits of the sale of our pharmacy business, favorable merchandising mix and our cost-savings initiatives. These benefits allowed us to offset markdown pressure in a very promotional environment. 
The team also delivered on the expense line, which benefited from the pharmacy sale and cost initiatives, offsetting pressure from investments we've made in our business, including our team. Cathy will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Sales in the quarter came in lighter than expected, and daily and regional shopping patterns were more volatile than in the prior periods. While guests generally maintained their pattern of larger, pantry stocking visits, we saw a slowdown in growth of smaller convenience trips. 
Against that background, our results show that our strategy continues to resonate with our guests as comparable sales in our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, grew more than 3x as fast as the company average. Given the concentration of signature categories in Home and Apparel, comparable sales in both categories outperformed the company, driving market share gains in both areas. 
Comps in Home grew nearly 4%, led by strength in Domestics, decor and Seasonal areas. Highlights include our Kids Home assortment, which saw comp sales in the mid-teens, driven by the successful launch of our new Pillowfort brand. We were also pleased with the results from our partnership with Marimekko, which attracted guests to explore our assortment in stores and digital, driving sales in both Home and Apparel. 
Overall comps in Apparel grew between 2% and 3%, led by sales in Baby, Kids and women's ready-to-wear. Rapid growth in ready-to-wear is especially notable given the tough comparison from last year. Specifically, the 2-year stack of the first quarter comp sales in ready-to-wear is more than 16% higher than 2 years ago. 
First quarter comps in Food were down slightly as an increase in perishable was offset by a decline in center store Grocery. While results were affected by deflation in some categories, they also reflected a meaningful disruption from the reset of our center store Grocery area, which was executed in stores across the country in April. 
Despite the disruption, this effort better positions us for success over the longer term as we implemented changes to assortment, presentation and category adjacencies. Specifically, we've updated assortment and segmentation to align with local demographics and showcase Wellness, and we integrated nutrition bars into the center store floor pad, creating an industry-leading destination for these items. 
In total, we added about 1,000 new items with this resets, including 55 new better-for-you brands across 25 categories, and we've incorporated our Simply Balanced brand into an additional 30 categories. This represents an important step in the reinvention of our Grocery business. Following the reset, we received very positive guest feedback, and the subsequent results have been better than expected. 
Within Hardlines, we saw high single-digit increase in the first quarter of comparable sales in Toys even as we comped over high single-digit growth last year. Offsetting the growth in Toys, we saw declines in Electronics and Entertainment, reflecting the secular challenges these categories continue to face. These declines put about 70 basis points of pressure on our first quarter comparable sales growth. 
I want to pause and welcome Mark Tritton, who'll be joining our team as the EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer, overseeing our enterprise buying, sourcing, product design development and merchandising operations. We've conducted an exhaustive search for a new CMO, and I'm confident Mark is the right leader for our merchandising team. Mark comes to us with a wealth of retail and merchandising experience, including positions at Nike, Timberland and Nordstrom, where Mark doubled their private label business. Mark is a bold, decisive and visionary retail leader, and we're excited to have him on our Target team. 
Once again this quarter, we were able to return a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Altogether, we returned more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, up from just under $900 million a year ago. 
In addition, given our strong financial position, this quarter, we were able to refinance some high-cost debt by issuing new debt at very attractive rates. Cathy will provide more detail in a few minutes. 
As we look ahead, we're approaching our business with appropriate caution as sales trends at Target and many of our key competitors weakened and became more volatile in the first quarter. In addition, many of our competitors are sitting on meaningful excess inventory, which we expect will extend a very promotional environment into the months ahead. 
Despite our near-term caution, we'll continue to execute the long-term strategy vision that we laid out 18 months ago, the vision which has been shaping our results ever since. We're very excited about the launch of our new Kids Apparel brand, Cat & Jack, which we'll roll out in the second quarter, and we'll continue to invest in quality through our owned and exclusive brand assortment with a proper emphasis on signature categories. 
We'll continue to work to enhance our Food offering to become more fresh and local with more natural and clean label offerings, and we'll continue to partner with our colleagues at CVS to complete rebranding of our pharmacies within our stores. Following the rebranding effort, we'll collaborate with CVS on an awareness campaign to ensure that both our guests and members of our PBM businesses are aware of the change within our stores. 
As John will describe in a few minutes, we're also investing in store experience and flexible fulfillment capabilities while modernizing our supply chain to become more agile in the way we serve our guests. We're very excited to be near completion of our LA25 remodels, which began more -- before the holiday season, and we're eager to gain guest feedback to determine which enhancements we'll roll out more broadly the future. 
And finally, we're making investments in our team, adding specialized talent like new visual merchandising leaders, who are ensuring the store presentation and our Style categories highlight the investments we're making to enhance quality and innovation. 
Going forward, we'll continue to look for ways to simplify processes in our stores, bring up time for our team to focus on serving our guests. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to thank the entire Target team for their tireless work on behalf of our business and our guests. As we've said many times, we have the best human retail, both in our stores and our headquarters, and I'm continually inspired by their passion to drive Target's success by better serving our guests. With this outstanding team, a strong brand, great-looking stores, a resilient business model and a strong balance sheet, I'm confident that we'll successfully navigate the near-term retail environment as we implement strategies that will drive Target's long-term success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide an update on our efforts to reduce out of stocks and improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. Then I'll cover our current work to enable our existing supply chain infrastructure to operate more flexibly in support of our strategy. And finally, I'll turn to our efforts to elevate the store experience on behalf of our guests, including enhancements to the order pickup process. 
Many of you have told us that you noticed the improvement in our in-stock position in our stores, and our internal measures confirm what you have been seeing. Specifically, in the first quarter, we saw a 27% improvement in out-of-stock measures compared with the first quarter last year. This represents a sequential acceleration from our fourth quarter performance, and we are seeing improvements across all of our merchandise categories. 
Some of the in-stocks improvement is being driven by additional inventory investments in the Central categories, which drove a portion of our year-over-year increase in our inventory at the end of the quarter. However, we have opportunities to make other changes that will allow us to streamline our inventory position over time. 
Specifically, the team is taking a data-driven approach to reduce the number of SKUs in our assortment, making room for additional phasings of the best-selling, faster-turning items in our store shelves. In addition, the team is collaborating with vendors to reduce case pack sizes, which will reduce backroom inventory while increasing store labor efficiency by reducing the number of times an item is touched before it's displayed on shelves. 
Beyond these improvements, the out-of-stock team has successfully tested other enhancements that we'll roll out later this year. One test applied new replenishment algorithms for items with regular demand patterns like Seasonal Sporting Goods, and the results of the test were dramatic as out of stocks improved by 50% on test items. 
Another test involved updates to our presentation standards for items that are typically purchased in multiples. This ensures that our minimum standards reflect the way guests are shopping today, allowing us to better optimize the trade-off between inventory investments and out of stocks. 
And with our vendor partners, the team has worked to meaningfully reduce shipping windows, which will enhance speed and reliability throughout the supply chain. We're very pleased with the collaboration we've seen from our vendors on this effort, and improving ship from windows will be implemented across all merchandise categories by this fall. 
Beyond our work on in stocks, we're making changes in our distribution centers to modernize our capabilities. These changes will allow our existing infrastructure to operate more flexibly, simultaneously reducing shipping times while efficiently leveraging our entire network inventory on behalf of our guests. 
At our financial community meeting in March, I outlined the conversion of 3 of our traditional regional distribution centers into delayed allocation centers, which can house slower-turning items with more variable demand, allowing the remaining DCs to process faster-turning SKUs more efficiently. In addition, these delayed allocation centers allow us to pulse the right amount of Seasonal inventory across the country throughout the season as demand patterns emerge, keeping us in stock longer in areas of unexpectedly high demand or reducing excess inventory in areas of unexpectedly low demand. 
We successfully completed the conversion of all 3 delayed allocation centers in the first quarter, and early results indicate that these additional nodes are improving product allocation compared with our past performance. 
Among our other regional DCs, this year we're making changes to 3 facilities to enable them to ship directly to guests. This requires a meaningful transformation in the capabilities of these facilities as direct-to-guest shipments require the team to pick and pack individual items while shipments to stores require fast-moving shipments of case packs and pallets. 
Despite the challenge, we are excited about this work because like our ship-from-store capability, the ability to ship from our regional DCs directly to guest provides deeper access to a network inventory, enhancing our digital in-stocks while allowing us to reach our guests more quickly while controlling costs. 
In addition, adding direct ship capability to one of our existing facilities requires 85% lower capital investment compared to the construction of a new dedicated web fulfillment center. As you know, a meaningful portion of our capital expenditure for the recent years has been devoted to technology and supply chain, and we said that we expect these investments to continue in the future. 
At the same time, we know that investments in our store experience are more important than ever, and as a result, nearly $1 billion of our CapEx this year will be focused on the store experience. In addition to our store remodel program, which includes the LA25 stores Brian highlighted earlier, we continue to roll out new flexible format stores in dense urban and suburban areas, and we're really pleased with the performance of these new hyper localized stores so far. 
In addition, we continue to invest in presentation and experience across the broad set of our stores. This year, we're investing in self-checkout lanes, operational enhancements and merchandising innovations across a meaningful portion of the store base. 
A key area of focus in our stores is the elevation of our digital order pickup, and the team is taking steps to make the process more convenient and less transactional for our guests. Our goal in these efforts is to increase satisfaction with the order pickup experience, leading to more repeat usage of this capability by our guests. 
Speed is key, and our store teams continue to improve the speed with which they fill pickup orders. In the first quarter, approximately 90% of orders were ready for pickup in less than an hour, up nearly 10 percentage points from last year. This is one reason that guest satisfaction regarding the pickup experience is up meaningfully from last year, and repeat usage is increasing as well. 
Despite this progress, we have more work to do, and we intend to continually improve our performance in response to guest feedback. To maintain our momentum, we rolled out streamlined order pickup communication to our guests this month. And in select stores, we are testing a separate pickup area with additional holding capacity, dedicated team members and enhanced merchandise presentation to encourage additional shopping on their store visit. 
While we are still early in our efforts, I am really pleased with the progress we've made in a short amount of time. By focusing on downstream outcomes and improving handoffs between every part of the supply chain from vendor to distribution center to our stores, we are making systematic, repeatable improvements, which will sustain better operating metrics over time. 
Now I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"
174438,329308239,987870,"Target Corp., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 18, 2016",2016-05-18,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of unexpectedly choppy and weak environment.

As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of unexpectedly choppy and weak environment. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was $0.19 higher than last year and $0.04 better than the high end of our guidance. First quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.02, $0.27 lower than the adjusted EPS, reflecting $0.26 of losses related to our debt tender offer and $0.01 of expense related to the sense of our pharmacy business. 
Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 1.2% was driven by growth -- both growth in traffic and ticket -- average ticket. As expected, total sales declined from last year, reflecting the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS. 
Within the quarter, we experienced solid results through the Easter holiday. Post Easter, sales and traffic trends softened noticeably, consistent with what you heard from many of our competitors. 
Also notable in the first quarter, we saw a meaningful increase in the volatility of our weekly sales performance compared with last year. Not surprisingly, weather patterns caused some of this volatility as we saw a meaningful correlation between sales and temperature trends in different regions of the country. 
We continue to invest in our digital and flexible fulfillment capabilities to drive sales in all channels, and we continue to see strong results. Comparable digital sales increased 23% in the first quarter, on top of a 38% increase a year ago. 
REDcard penetration was 23.4% in the first quarter, up nearly 200 basis points from last year. This represents the addition of nearly 700,000 new credit and debit accounts in the quarter combined with the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding the impact of the pharmacy sales, penetration was up about 80 basis points from a year ago. 
Our team delivered a stronger-than-expected 11.5% EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter. On the gross margin line, we saw about 50 basis points of improvement from last year. This growth reflects the benefit of the sale of pharmacy business and continued positive merchandise mix, driven by strength in signature categories. These benefits offset markdown pressure in an environment which continues to be very promotional. 
On the SG&A line, we saw the benefits of strong discipline across the organization along with the benefits from the sale of pharmacy business. This allowed us to offset strategic investments we're making in our business, including our team. 
Altogether, first quarter SG&A expense was about 50 basis points better than last year. Quarter-end inventory was up a little bit more than 4%, rising faster than sales. As John mentioned, some of this growth reflected intentional inventory investments in -- to support in-stocks and essential categories. However, given the recent slowdown in our sales and our caution regarding the second quarter, we are planning to manage inventory carefully throughout this quarter and beyond. 
Turning to capital deployment. We returned $336 million to shareholders in the form of dividends this quarter and invested nearly $900 million in share repurchase. As Brian mentioned, we also took the opportunity to refinance some high-coupon debt during the quarter, with the issuance of 10-year and 30-year bonds at very attractive rates. 
As a result, we recognized $261 million in debt retirement losses in first quarter GAAP EPS. And given that the settlement of -- on the last tranche of the debt tender occurred at the beginning of the second quarter, we expect to recognize another $151 [ph] million of debt retirement losses in second quarter GAAP EPS. 
Beyond these accounting losses, we expect this refinancing to reduce our ongoing interest expense by $5 million to $10 million per quarter. I want to pause here and discuss our quarter-end cash position. We ended the first quarter with about $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, essentially the same as when we started the quarter. However, this was the result of timing, and we expect to reduce our cash position by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter. 
In fact, already this quarter, we deployed nearly $1 billion to retire the final tranche of the debt tender, and we expect to apply another $750 million to fund a debt maturity in July. When you combine these uses with continued investment in the dividend and share repurchase, we expect to end the second quarter with a balance of between $1 billion and $2 billion. 
I want to emphasize that our capital deployment priorities remain the same. We invest first, in our business to support projects that meet our strategic infancy criteria; secondly, support the dividend and expect to maintain our record of consecutive annual dividend increases since 1971; and finally, we invest in share repurchase within the limits of our A long-term credit rating. 
One of our longer-term financial goals is to increase our after-tax return on invested capital, and we expect to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next 5 years, and I'm pleased that we are already making meaningful progress on this metric. For the 12-month period through the first quarter, we reported an after-tax return of 16%, including the gain on the pharmacy sale in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding that gain, our after-tax return on invested capital was a very strong 14% in the first quarter, up about 150 basis points from a year ago. 
On another note, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was unusually low in the first quarter at 31.6%. This was the result of the adoption of a new accounting standard for employee share-based payments, which reduced our tax expense by $17 million combined with the impact of lower pretax earnings resulting from the loss on debt retirement. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the implications for the full year. While we're coming off a quarter of outstanding financial performance, Brian mentioned earlier with elevated short-term volatility and softer sales trends since Easter, it's clear that consumers are behaving more cautiously. 
With that backdrop, we are planning for second quarter comparable sales of flat to down 2%. This would represent slower than second quarter performance that we were planning at the beginning of the year, but we believe this outlook is prudent given the trends we see as many others have been seeing. Given slower-than-expected sales, we are planning for a moderate year-over-year decline in our second quarter EBITDA margin rate in a range of 40 basis points at the midpoint of our comp guidance. 
Compared with our planning going into the year, our updated expectations reflect continued gross margin pressure from a very promotional environment combined with a deleveraging of SG&A expense on floor sales. Altogether, we expect to generate second quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1 to $1.20. Given our performance over the 1.5 years, we believe we're pursuing the right strategies and our strategy is working. We have many levers we can deploy to drive our performance even if the environment remains challenging. As a result, even with the more tempered view of the second quarter, we are still focused on achieving full year adjusted EPS within the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. 
As we progress through the second quarter, all of us will gain more perspective, which will inform our outlook for the latter half of the year. As I mentioned at our financial community meeting, one of my first priorities on joining this team last year was to dig in and understand in detail the factors that drive Target's financial performance. As a result of that view, I am confident in the resilience of our business model, which sustained our business through all consumer and retail environments. Importantly, our financial strength, combined with our business model, enable us to continue investing in our long-term priorities even when others are having to fall back. It's one of the many reasons I was so excited to join this team and this company last September. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I are happy to take your questions."

And as we look at business in April and again in the start of May, we've seen a significant performance difference between our West Coast markets and particularly our Northeast markets and significant variability where we've seen some very positive growth performance across our entire portfolio in Los Angeles, in San Francisco and many of our core West Coast markets, offset by a significant slowness in the Northeast in Boston, New York, in Philadelphia, in D.C. And given categories, we've seen dramatic performance differences. In the ready-to-wear category, on the West Coast and in parts of the Midwest where we've seen an earlier spring, we're seeing double-digit growth in ready-to-wear, offset by fairly significant declines in the Northeast. We had a review with our team yesterday. We looked at categories like finance. We have markets that are up 20% and markets that are down 90%. So we're seeing volatility driven by certainly climate, but I think a number of other factors that we're certainly analyzing. Cathy talked about an earlier Easter. We've certainly looked at weather patterns. We recognize that year-on-year, fuel prices have increased, and our guess is the consumer spending more than they did a year ago at the pump, and we suddenly recognize that within overall categories, today's consumer, our guests is reinvesting in their homes. They're spending money on Home improvement. We've seen that in our Home category, which was up 4% in the first quarter. So a lot of volatility, and it's both geographic and within category mixes."

So as we think about actions we're taking in our business right now, we want to continue to make sure we're serving the guest who's looking for that stock-up items, that stock-up trip, and we're going to be even more focused as we manage through the quarter and the balance of the year to make sure we're winning and driving more fill-in trips. So you'll see us enhance and change both our promotional calendar, our in-store presentation of more fill-in items to make sure that we're doing both, continuing to win with a guest who's shopping Target for that stock-up occasion but also making sure we're capturing more of that fill-in trip throughout the quarter. So those are actions that we're taking right now. The team's working on making adjustments in our promotional cadence and presentation to make sure that we're doing both. We're continuing to win with stock-up shopper, but we're also capturing more sure of wallet with that fill-in guest. From a promotional standpoint, we would expect to see most of the intensity in the Apparel space, where we certainly recognize that many of our competitors are sitting on high levels of inventory, we've got to be prepared for continued promotional intensity in that space, and I think we're well positioned as both Cathy and John have noted to manage through that throughout the quarter."

It's why we've elevated our focus on making sure that we provide an easy shopping experience for our guests online. We continue to build out those capabilities. So we recognize that even as we look at the start of 2016, the majority of the retail business in the United States continues to be done in stores, but it starts online. So we've got to have great digital capabilities to make sure when our guest is shopping Target no matter how they shop, we make it a convenient, easy experience, so that has not changed dramatically. And one of the numbers that we feel best about in the first quarter is the fact that on top of a very strong 38% growth in the first quarter of 2015, we grew our digital sales by 23%. So we're continuing to connect with that guest that wants to shop Target online, and we're continue -- we'll continue to invest and build our capability from that space."

I think one of the things that we're certainly recognizing as we look at 2016 shopping patterns is there is a consumer and a guest who continues to look for value and that value's expressed in more fill-in trips, buying smaller packs, smaller baskets. So again, it's not a shift in our strategy. It's a recognition that we have to do both. We have to continue to delight the guest when they come to Target for that big stock of occasion, and we have to have the right assortment, the right value, the right presentation for that guest who's coming to us for the fill-in trip.

And in many of these categories like the significant change we made in bars, we're seeing very strong sales results coming out of the reset.

And as Cathy and John have both mentioned, we feel very good about the progress we're making from a strategic standpoint. We talked multiple times now certainly, we talked to most of you on the call during our March Investor Day. Our continued focus on building out our digital capabilities. We're making very good progress there. We think those are going to be essential to our future. We feel very good about the progress we're making on signature categories, where we continue to build market share and drive differentiation. We're very excited about the early results of Pillowfort and feel as if when we launched our new Cat & Jack brand for Kids, that is going to be another potential $1 billion brand in our portfolio. So great progress from a category role and signature category standpoint. As John mentioned during his remarks, our flex formats continue to be very well received as we move into new urban markets. We're excited about our Tribeca store that will open up in October, but we've been excited about every one of these new flex formats, and they've been well received in both urban and college markets. We continue to think we've got significant opportunities in localization and the work we've done in Chicago and now, Los Angeles, just continues to confirm that. So our strategy continues to perform well. John and the team continue to enhance our store and supply chain capabilities to continue to meet the needs of our guests. So as we sit here today, there is no significant change in our strategy. But tactically, we recognize the consumer environment is tougher. We've got to make sure we're delivering the right value, we're winning with both of stock up and the fill-in trip. We're making sure that we have the right experience for our guest whether shopping in-store and online, and we don't see any structural change in the consumer environment. We think this is a short-term bump in the road, but we think we're well positioned and everything we see from a GDP and consumer confidence standpoint gives us the confidence that this is going to be a short-term impact, and we're going to see very solid results in both the third and fourth quarter and keep us on our long-term guidance track."

We think we're continuing to improve our digital capabilities. I think our store experience is improving each and every week. The response we're getting from the guest based on changes we've made in Apparel and Home and recently in Food are very encouraging. As John mentioned, our flex format's performing quite well. So we feel confident that the content we have in place, the plans we have for the second half of the year, some of the enhancements we've made from a branding and in-store and online standpoint are going to continue to deliver solid results.

Before I start with prepared remarks, let me set up the structure for our call this morning. We want to make sure we spend significant time talking about our first quarter results, and Cathy and John and I will cover both our first quarter performance, but also talk about the second quarter outlook. But we are going to make sure we leave significant time for Q&A. We want to make sure we have time today to address your questions, provide additional insights into our first quarter performance and the factors that are guiding our outlook for Q2. 
Let me start with the first quarter. Our team delivered outstanding first quarter financial results in a very challenging consumer environment, which became softer and more volatile as the quarter progressed. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was well beyond the high end of the guidance for the quarter and more than 16% ahead of the $1.10 last year. These results demonstrate the value of our strategy in the face of more challenging consumer landscape. 
First quarter comparable sales growth was driven by an increase in both traffic and average ticket as traffic grew in both our stores and digital channels. Comparable digital sales grew 23% in the first quarter on top of 38% a year ago. 
We generated very healthy profit margins on our sales in the quarter as our team did a great job managing the business in the face of a number of headwinds, particularly following the Easter holiday. As planned, our first quarter gross margin rate reflected the benefits of the sale of our pharmacy business, favorable merchandising mix and our cost-savings initiatives. These benefits allowed us to offset markdown pressure in a very promotional environment. 
The team also delivered on the expense line, which benefited from the pharmacy sale and cost initiatives, offsetting pressure from investments we've made in our business, including our team. Cathy will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Sales in the quarter came in lighter than expected, and daily and regional shopping patterns were more volatile than in the prior periods. While guests generally maintained their pattern of larger pantry stocking visits, we saw a slowdown in growth of smaller convenience trips. 
Against that background, our results show that our strategy continues to resonate with our guests as comparable sales in our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, grew more than 3x as fast as the company average. Given the concentration of signature categories in Home and Apparel, comparable sales in both categories outperformed the company, driving market share gains in both areas. 
Comps in Home grew nearly 4%, led by strength in domestics, decor and seasonal areas. Highlights included our Kids Home assortment, which saw comp sales in the mid-teens, driven by the successful launch of our new Pillowfort brand. We were also pleased with the results from our partnership with Marimekko, which attracted guests to explore our assortment in stores and digital, driving sales in both Home and Apparel. 
Overall comps in Apparel grew between 2% and 3%, led by sales in Baby, Kids and Women's ready-to-wear. Rapid growth in ready-to-wear is especially notable given the tough comparison from last year. Specifically, the 2-year stack of the first quarter comp sales in ready-to-wear is more than 16% higher than 2 years ago. 
First quarter comps in Food were down slightly as an increase in perishable was offset by a decline in center store grocery. While results were impacted by deflation in some categories, they also reflected a meaningful disruption from the reset of our center store grocery area, which was executed in stores across the country in April. 
Despite the disruption, this effort better positions us for success over the longer term as we implemented changes to assortment, presentation and category adjacencies. Specifically, we've updated assortment and segmentation to align with local demographics and showcase wellness. And we integrated nutrition bars into the center store floor pad, creating an industry-leading destination for these items. 
In total, we added about 1,000 new items with this reset, including 55 new better-for-you brands across 25 categories. And we've incorporated our Simply Balanced brand into an additional 30 categories. This represents an important step in the reinvention of our Grocery business. Following the reset, we received very positive guest feedback. And the subsequent results have been better than expected. 
Within Hardlines, we saw high single-digit increase in the first quarter of comparable sales in Toys even as we comped over high single-digit growth last year. Offsetting the growth in Toys, we saw declines in Electronics and Entertainment, reflecting the secular challenges these categories continue to face. These declines put about 70 basis points of pressure on our first quarter comparable sales growth. 
I want to pause and welcome Mark Tritton, who'll be joining our team as the EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer, overseeing our enterprise buying, sourcing, product design development and merchandising operations. We've conducted an exhaustive search for a new CMO, and I'm confident Mark is the right leader for our merchandising team. Mark comes to us with a wealth of retail and merchandising experience, including positions at Nike, Timberland and Nordstrom, where Mark doubled their private label business. Mark is a bold, decisive and visionary retail leader, and we're excited to have him on our Target team. 
Once again this quarter, we were able to return a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Altogether, we returned more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, up from just under $900 million a year ago. 
In addition, given our strong financial position, this quarter, we were able to refinance some high-cost debt by issuing new debt at very attractive rates. Cathy will provide more detail in a few minutes. 
As we look ahead, we're approaching our business with appropriate caution as sales trends at Target and many of our key competitors weakened and became more volatile in the first quarter. In addition, many of our competitors are sitting on meaningful excess inventory, which we expect will extend a very intense promotional environment into the months ahead. 
Despite our near-term caution, we'll continue to execute the long-term strategy vision that we laid out 18 months ago, the vision which has been shaping our results ever since. We're very excited about the launch of our new Kids Apparel brand, Cat & Jack, which we'll roll out in the second quarter. And we'll continue to invest in quality through our owned and exclusive brand assortment with a particular emphasis on signature categories. 
We'll continue to work to enhance our Food offering to become more fresh and local with more natural and clean label offerings. And we'll continue to partner with our colleagues at CVS to complete the rebranding of our pharmacies within our stores. Following the rebranding effort, we'll collaborate with CVS on an awareness campaign to ensure that both our guests and members of our PBM businesses are aware of the change within our stores. 
As John will describe in a few minutes, we're also investing in store experience and flexible fulfillment capabilities, while modernizing our supply chain to become more agile in the way we serve our guests. We're very excited to be near completion of our LA25 remodels, which began more -- before the holiday season. And we're eager to gain guest feedback to determine which enhancements we'll roll out more broadly in the future. 
And finally, we're making investments in our team, adding specialized talent like new visual merchandising leaders, who are ensuring the store presentation in our Style categories highlight the investments we're making to enhance quality and innovation. Going forward, we'll continue to look for ways to simplify processes in our stores, bring up time for our team to focus on serving our guests. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to thank the entire Target team for their tireless work on behalf of our business and our guests. As we've said many times, we have the best team in retail, both in our stores and our headquarters. And I'm continually inspired by their passion to drive Target's success by better serving our guests. With this outstanding team, a strong brand, great-looking stores, a resilient business model and a strong balance sheet, I'm confident we'll successfully navigate the near-term retail environment as we implement strategies that will drive Target's long-term success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide an update on our efforts to reduce out of stocks and improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. Then I'll cover our current work to enable our existing supply chain infrastructure to operate more flexibly in support of our strategy. And finally, I'll turn to our efforts to elevate the store experience on behalf of our guests, including enhancements to the order pickup process. 
Many of you have told us that you noticed the improvement in our in-stock position in our stores, and our internal measures confirm what you have been seeing. Specifically, in the first quarter, we saw a 27% improvement in out-of-stock measures compared with the first quarter last year. This represents a sequential acceleration from our fourth quarter performance. And we are seeing improvements across all of our merchandise categories. 
Some of the in-stock improvement is being driven by additional inventory investments in the central categories, which drove a portion of our year-over-year increase in our inventory at the end of the quarter. However, we have opportunities to make other changes that will allow us to streamline our inventory position over time. 
Specifically, the team is taking a data-driven approach to reduce the number of SKUs in our assortment, making room for additional phasings of the best-selling, faster-turning items on our store shelves. In addition, the team is collaborating with vendors to reduce case pack sizes, which will reduce backroom inventory while increasing store labor efficiency by reducing the number of times an item is touched before it's displayed on shelves. 
Beyond these improvements, the out-of-stock team has successfully tested other enhancements that we'll roll out later this year. One test applied new replenishment algorithms for items with the regular demand patterns like Seasonal Sporting Goods. And the results of the test were dramatic as out of stocks improved by 50% on test items. 
Another test involves updates to our presentation standards for items that are typically purchased in multiples. This ensures that our minimum standards reflect the way guests are shopping today, allowing us to better optimize the trade-off between inventory investments and out of stocks. 
And with our vendor partners, the team has worked to meaningfully reduce shipping windows, which will enhance speed and reliability throughout the supply chain. We're very pleased with the collaboration we've seen from our vendors on this effort and improving ship from windows will be implemented across all merchandise categories by this fall. 
Beyond our work on in stocks, we're making changes in our distribution centers to modernize our capabilities. These changes will allow our existing infrastructure to operate more flexibly, simultaneously reducing shipping times while efficiently leveraging our entire network inventory on behalf of our guests. 
At our Financial Community Meeting in March, I outlined the conversion of 3 of our traditional regional distribution centers into delayed allocation centers, which can house slower-turning items with more variable demand, allowing the remaining DCs to process faster-turning SKUs more efficiently. In addition, these delayed allocation centers allow us to pulse the right amount of Seasonal inventory across the country throughout the season as demand patterns emerge, keeping us in stock longer in areas of unexpectedly high demand or reducing excess inventory in areas of unexpectedly low demand. 
We successfully completed the conversion of all 3 delayed allocation centers in the first quarter, and early results indicate that these additional nodes are improving product allocation compared with our past performance. 
Among our other regional DCs, this year, we're making changes to 3 facilities to enable them to ship directly to guests. This requires a meaningful transformation in the capabilities of these facilities as direct-to-guest shipments require the team to pick and pack individual items while shipments to stores require fast-moving shipments of case packs and pallets. Despite the challenge, we are excited about this work because like our ship-from-store capability, the ability to ship from our regional DCs directly to guests provides deeper access to network inventory, enhancing our digital in-stocks while allowing us to reach our guests more quickly while controlling costs. 
In addition, adding direct ship capability to one of our existing facilities requires 85% lower capital investment compared to the construction of a new dedicated web fulfillment center. As you know, a meaningful portion of our capital expenditures in recent years has been devoted to technology and supply chain. And we said that we expect these investments to continue in the future. 
At the same time, we know that investments in our store experience are more important than ever. And as a result, nearly $1 billion of our CapEx this year will be focused on the store experience. In addition to our store remodel program, which includes the LA25 stores Brian highlighted earlier, we continue to roll out new flexible format stores in dense urban and suburban areas. And we're really pleased with the performance of these new hyper localized stores so far. 
In addition, we continue to invest in presentation and experience across the broad set of our stores. This year, we're investing in self-checkout lanes, operational enhancements and merchandising innovations across a meaningful portion of the store base. 
A key area of focus in our stores is the elevation of our digital order pickup. And the team is taking steps to make the process more convenient and less transactional for our guests. Our goal in these efforts is to increase satisfaction with the order pickup experience, leading to more repeat usage of this capability by our guests. 
Speed is key, and our store teams continue to improve the speed with which they fulfill pick-up orders. In the first quarter, approximately 90% of orders were ready for pickup in less than an hour, up nearly 10 percentage points from last year. This is one reason that guest satisfaction regarding the pickup experience is up meaningfully from last year, and repeat usage is increasing as well. 
Despite this progress, we have more work to do. And we intend to continually improve our performance in response to guest feedback. To maintain our momentum, we rolled out streamlined order pickup communication to our guests this month. And in select stores, we are testing a separate pickup area with additional holding capacity, dedicated team members and enhanced merchandise presentation to encourage additional shopping on their store visit. 
While we are still early in our efforts, I am really pleased with the progress we've made in a short amount of time. By focusing on downstream outcomes and improving handoffs between every part of the supply chain from vendor to distribution center to our stores, we are making systematic, repeatable improvements, which will sustain better operating metrics over time. 
Now I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"

As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of an unexpectedly choppy and weak environment.

As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of an unexpectedly choppy and weak environment. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was $0.19 higher than last year and $0.04 better than the high end of our guidance. First quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.02, $0.27 lower than the adjusted EPS, reflecting $0.26 of losses related to our debt tender offer and $0.01 of expense related to the sale of our pharmacy business. 
Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 1.2% was driven by growth -- both growth in traffic and ticket, average ticket. As expected, total sales declined from last year, reflecting the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS. Within the quarter, we experienced solid results through the Easter holiday. Post-Easter, sales and traffic trends softened noticeably, consistent with what you've heard from many of our competitors. 
Also notable in the first quarter, we saw a meaningful increase in the volatility of our weekly sales performance compared with last year. Not surprisingly, weather patterns caused some of this volatility as we saw a meaningful correlation between sales and temperature trends in different regions of the country. We continue to invest in our digital and flexible fulfillment capabilities to drive sales in all channels, and we continue to see strong results. Comparable digital sales increased 23% in the first quarter, on top of the 38% increase a year ago. 
REDcard penetration was 23.4% in the first quarter, up nearly 200 basis points from last year. This represents the addition of nearly 700,000 new credit and debit accounts in the quarter combined with the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding the impact of the pharmacy sales, penetration was up about 80 basis points from a year ago. 
Our team delivered a stronger-than-expected 11.5% EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter. On the gross margin line, we saw about 50 basis points of improvement from last year. This growth reflects the benefit of the sale of the pharmacy business and continued positive merchandise mix, driven by strength in signature categories. These benefits offset markdown pressure in an environment, which continues to be very promotional. 
On the SG&A line, we saw the benefit of strong discipline across the organization along with the benefit from the sale of the pharmacy business. This allowed us to offset strategic investments we're making in our business, including our team. 
Altogether, first quarter SG&A expense was about 50 basis points better than last year. Quarter-end inventory was up a little bit more than 4%, rising faster than sales. As John mentioned, some of this growth reflected intentional inventory investments in -- to support in-stocks and essential categories. However, given the recent slowdown in our sales and our caution regarding the second quarter, we are planning to manage inventory carefully throughout this quarter and beyond. 
Turning to capital deployment. We returned $336 million to shareholders in the form of dividends this quarter and invested nearly $900 million in share repurchase. As Brian mentioned, we also took the opportunity to refinance some high-coupon debt during the quarter with the issuance of 10-year and 30-year bonds at very attractive rates. 
As a result, we recognized $261 million in debt retirement losses in first quarter GAAP EPS. And given that the settlement of -- on the last tranche of the debt tender occurred at the beginning of the second quarter, we expect to recognize another $151 million of debt retirement losses in second quarter GAAP EPS. 
Beyond these accounting losses, we expect this refinancing to reduce our ongoing interest expense by $5 million to $10 million per quarter. I want to pause here and discuss our quarter-end cash position. We ended the first quarter with about $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, essentially the same as when we started the quarter. However, this was the result of timing. And we expect to reduce our cash position by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter. In fact, already this quarter, we deployed nearly $1 billion to retire the final tranche of the debt tender. And we expect to apply another $750 million to fund a debt maturity in July. When you combine these uses with continued investments in the dividend and share repurchase, we expect to end the second quarter with a cash balance of between $1 billion and $2 billion. 
I want to emphasize that our capital deployment priorities remain the same. We invest first in our business to support projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria; second, we support the dividend and expect to maintain our record of consecutive annual dividend increases since 1971; and finally, we invest in share repurchase within the limits of our A long-term credit rating. 
One of our longer-term financial goals is to increase our after-tax return on invested capital, and we expect to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next 5 years. And I'm pleased that we are already making meaningful progress on this metric. For the 12-month period through the first quarter, we reported an after-tax return of 16%, including the gain on the pharmacy sale in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding that gain, our after-tax return on invested capital was a very strong 14% in the first quarter, up about 150 basis points from a year ago. 
On another note, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was unusually low in the first quarter at 31.6%. This was the result of the adoption of a new accounting standard for employee share-based payments, which reduced our tax expense by $17 million combined with the impact of lower pretax earnings resulting from the loss on debt retirement. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the implications for the full year. While we're coming off a quarter of outstanding financial performance, Brian mentioned earlier with elevated short-term volatility and softer sales trends since Easter, it's clear that consumers are behaving more cautiously. 
With that backdrop, we are planning for second quarter comparable sales of flat to down 2%. This would represent slower than second quarter performance that we were planning at the beginning of the year. But we believe this outlook is prudent given the trends we see as many others have been seeing. Given slower-than-expected sales, we are planning for a moderate year-over-year decline in our second quarter EBITDA margin rate in a range of 40 basis points at the midpoint of our comp guidance. 
Compared with our plan going into the year, our updated expectations reflect continued gross margin pressure from a very promotional environment combined with a deleveraging of SG&A expense on floor sales. Altogether, we expect to generate second quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1 to $1.20. Given our performance over the 1.5 years, we believe we're pursuing the right strategies, and our strategy is working. We have many levers we can deploy to drive our performance even if the environment remains challenging. As a result, even with a more tempered view of the second quarter, we are still focused on achieving full year adjusted EPS within the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. 
As we progress through the second quarter, all of us will gain more perspective, which will inform our outlook for the latter half of the year. As I mentioned at our Financial Community Meeting, one of my first priorities on joining this team last year was to dig in and understand in detail the factors that drive Target's financial performance. As a result of that view, I am confident in the resilience of our business model, which sustains our business through all consumer and retail environments. Importantly, our financial strength, combined with our business model, enable us to continue investing in our long-term priorities even when others are having to pull back. It's one of the many reasons I was so excited to join this team and this company last September. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I are happy to take your questions."

And given categories, we've seen dramatic performance differences. In the ready-to-wear category, on the West Coast and in parts of the Midwest where we've seen an earlier spring, we're seeing double-digit growth in ready-to-wear, offset by fairly significant declines in the Northeast. We had a review with our team yesterday. We looked at categories like fans. We have markets that are up 20%, and markets that are down 90%. So we're seeing volatility driven by certainly climate, but I think a number of other factors that we're certainly analyzing. Cathy talked about an earlier Easter. We've certainly looked at weather patterns. We recognize that year-on-year, fuel prices have increased. And our guests and the consumer is spending more than they did a year ago at the pump. And we certainly recognize that within overall categories, today's consumer, our guests is reinvesting in their homes. They're spending money on home improvement. We've seen that in our Home category, which was up 4% in the first quarter. So a lot of volatility, and it's both geographic and within category mixes."

So as we think about actions we're taking in our business right now, we want to continue to make sure we're serving the guest who's looking for that stock-up item, that stock-up trip. And we're going to be even more focused as we manage through the quarter and the balance of the year to make sure we're winning and driving more fill-in trips. So you'll see us enhance and change both our promotional calendar, our in-store presentation of more fill-in items to make sure that we're doing both, continuing to win with a guest who's shopping Target for that stock-up occasion, but also making sure we're capturing more of that fill-in trip throughout the quarter. So those are actions that we're taking right now. The team's working on making adjustments in our promotional cadence and presentation to make sure that we're doing both. We're continuing to win with the stock-up shopper, but we're also capturing more share of wallet with that fill-in guest.

And certainly, as we think about winning more trips with that fill-in guest, Cartwheel plays an incredibly important role. And we'll continue to make sure that we activate Cartwheel to drive those trips and meet that guest's need. I think one of the things that we're certainly recognizing as we look at 2016 shopping patterns is there is a consumer and a guest who continues to look for value. And that value's expressed in more fill-in trips, buying smaller packs, smaller baskets. So again, it's not a shift in our strategy, it's a recognition that we have to do both. We have to continue to delight the guests when they come to Target for that big stock of occasion, and we have to have the right assortment, the right value, the right presentation for that guest who's coming to us for the fill-in trip. So Cartwheel plays a very important role in that. And as we think about adjustments and modifications we're making to our plans, Cartwheel plays a very important role in driving more trips back to our stores, and certainly meeting the needs of our guests who's coming to us for that fill-in occasion."

Short term, it certainly has an impact on our performance in Grocery and Food. But as we've made the changes, the response we're seeing from the guest is very encouraging. They're recognizing the new assortment, the new brands, more local items, the fact that we have more organic and gluten-free items on our shelves. And in many of these categories like the significant change we made in bars, we're seeing very strong sales results coming out of the reset. So it was an investment we had to make in both labor and in disruption to make sure we continue to move forward in the reinvention of Food. So short term, it had a meaningful impact on our Food sales, but we certainly expect to see the recovery over the balance of this year as we provide a more relevant assortment to our Target Grocery shopper."

So great progress from a category role and signature category standpoint. As John mentioned during his remarks, our flex formats continue to be very well received as we move into new urban markets. We're excited about our TriBeCa store that we'll open up in October. But we've been excited about every one of these new flex formats, and they've been well received in both urban and college markets.

And do you have any data, for example, if you look by segment of consumer, income levels or REDcard usage that would help you understand the trends to a greater extent?"

So certainly, it was a earlier Easter. We recognize the impact of that. Certainly, weather in many major markets has been a factor. It's not an excuse. We've got to figure out how we perform under any circumstances. We know as the guests and our consumer has moved through the course of 2016, prices at the pump, fuel prices have risen, and that's certainly an impact. And then when we look at a macro basis on overall spending, we certainly recognize that consumers are spending more on travel, on leisure activities. They've been investing in their homes, as I mentioned before. But there's no structural change that gives us pause and has us changing our strategy, altering our outlook for the full year. We think we're continuing to improve our digital capabilities. I think our store experience is improving each and every week. The response we're getting from the guest based on changes we've made in Apparel and Home and recently in Food are very encouraging. As John mentioned, our flex format's performing quite well. So we feel confident that the content we have in place, the plans we have for the second half of the year, some of the enhancements we've made from a branding and in-store and online standpoint are going to continue to deliver solid results. So we see this as a momentary speed bump, but we see no reason to alter our strategy. These are tactical adjustments we have to make. And market by market, we've got to make sure we're well positioned to compete going forward."

Before I start with prepared remarks, let me set up the structure for our call this morning. We want to make sure we spend significant time talking about our first quarter results, and Cathy and John and I will cover both our first quarter performance, but also talk about the second quarter outlook. But we are going to make sure we leave significant time for Q&A. We want to make sure we have time today to address your questions, provide additional insights into our first quarter performance and the factors that are guiding our outlook for Q2. 
Let me start with the first quarter. Our team delivered outstanding first quarter financial results in a very challenging consumer environment, which became softer and more volatile as the quarter progressed. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was well beyond the high end of the guidance for the quarter and more than 16% ahead of the $1.10 last year. These results demonstrate the value of our strategy in the face of more challenging consumer landscape. 
First quarter comparable sales growth was driven by an increase in both traffic and average ticket as traffic grew in both our stores and digital channels. Comparable digital sales grew 23% in the first quarter on top of 38% a year ago. 
We generated very healthy profit margins on our sales in the quarter as our team did a great job managing the business in the face of a number of headwinds, particularly following the Easter holiday. As planned, our first quarter gross margin rate reflected the benefits of the sale of our pharmacy business, favorable merchandising mix and our cost-savings initiatives. These benefits allowed us to offset markdown pressure in a very promotional environment. 
The team also delivered on the expense line, which benefited from the pharmacy sale and cost initiatives, offsetting pressure from investments we've made in our business, including our team. Cathy will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Sales in the quarter came in lighter than expected, and daily and regional shopping patterns were more volatile than in the prior periods. While guests generally maintained their pattern of larger pantry stocking visits, we saw a slowdown in growth of smaller convenience trips. 
Against that background, our results show that our strategy continues to resonate with our guests as comparable sales in our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, grew more than 3x as fast as the company average. Given the concentration of signature categories in Home and Apparel, comparable sales in both categories outperformed the company, driving market share gains in both areas. 
Comps in Home grew nearly 4%, led by strength in domestics, decor and seasonal areas. Highlights included our Kids Home assortment, which saw comp sales in the mid-teens, driven by the successful launch of our new Pillowfort brand. We were also pleased with the results from our partnership with Marimekko, which attracted guests to explore our assortment in stores and digital, driving sales in both Home and Apparel. 
Overall comps in Apparel grew between 2% and 3%, led by sales in Baby, Kids and Women's ready-to-wear. Rapid growth in ready-to-wear is especially notable given the tough comparison from last year. Specifically, the 2-year stack of the first quarter comp sales in ready-to-wear is more than 16% higher than 2 years ago. 
First quarter comps in Food were down slightly as an increase in perishable was offset by a decline in center store grocery. While results were impacted by deflation in some categories, they also reflected a meaningful disruption from the reset of our center store grocery area, which was executed in stores across the country in April. 
Despite the disruption, this effort better positions us for success over the longer term as we've implemented changes to assortment, presentation and category adjacencies. Specifically, we've updated assortment and segmentation to align with local demographics and showcase wellness. And we integrated nutrition bars into the center store floor pad, creating an industry-leading destination for these items. 
In total, we added about 1,000 new items with this reset, including 55 new better-for-you brands across 25 categories. And we've incorporated our Simply Balanced brand into an additional 30 categories. This represents an important step in the reinvention of our Grocery business. Following the reset, we received very positive guest feedback. And the subsequent results have been better than expected. 
Within Hardlines, we saw a high single-digit increase in the first quarter of comparable sales in Toys even as we comped over high single-digit growth last year. Offsetting the growth in Toys, we saw declines in Electronics and Entertainment, reflecting the secular challenges these categories continue to face. These declines put about 70 basis points of pressure on our first quarter comparable sales growth. 
I want to pause and welcome Mark Tritton, who'll be joining our team as the EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer, overseeing our enterprise buying, sourcing, product design development and merchandising operations. We've conducted an exhaustive search for a new CMO, and I'm confident Mark is the right leader for our merchandising team. Mark comes to us with a wealth of retail and merchandising experience, including positions at Nike, Timberland and Nordstrom, where Mark doubled their private label business. Mark is a bold, decisive and visionary retail leader, and we're excited to have him on our Target team. 
Once again this quarter, we were able to return a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Altogether, we returned more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, up from just under $900 million a year ago. 
In addition, given our strong financial position, this quarter, we were able to refinance some high-cost debt by issuing new debt at very attractive rates. Cathy will provide more detail in a few minutes. 
As we look ahead, we're approaching our business with appropriate caution as sales trends at Target and many of our key competitors weakened and became more volatile in the first quarter. In addition, many of our competitors are sitting on meaningful excess inventory, which we expect will extend a very intense promotional environment into the months ahead. 
Despite our near-term caution, we'll continue to execute the long-term strategy vision that we laid out 18 months ago, the vision which has been shaping our results ever since. We're very excited about the launch of our new Kids Apparel brand, Cat & Jack, which we'll roll out in the second quarter. And we'll continue to invest in quality through our owned and exclusive brand assortment with a particular emphasis on signature categories. 
We'll continue to work to enhance our Food offering to become more fresh and local with more natural and clean label offerings. And we'll continue to partner with our colleagues at CVS to complete the rebranding of our pharmacies within our stores. Following the rebranding effort, we'll collaborate with CVS on an awareness campaign to ensure that both our guests and members of their PBM businesses are aware of the change within our stores. 
As John will describe in a few minutes, we're also investing in store experience and flexible fulfillment capabilities, while modernizing our supply chain to become more agile in the way we serve our guests. We're very excited to be near completion of our LA25 remodels, which began more -- before the holiday season. And we're eager to gain guest feedback to determine which enhancements we'll roll out more broadly in the future. 
And finally, we're making investments in our team, adding specialized talent like new visual merchandising leaders, who are ensuring the store presentation in our Style categories highlight the investments we're making to enhance quality and innovation. Going forward, we'll continue to look for ways to simplify processes in our stores, bringing up time for our team to focus on serving our guests. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to thank the entire Target team for their tireless work on behalf of our business and our guests. As we've said many times, we have the best team in retail, both in our stores and our headquarters. And I'm continually inspired by their passion to drive Target's success by better serving our guests. With this outstanding team, a strong brand, great-looking stores, a resilient business model and a strong balance sheet, I'm confident we'll successfully navigate the near-term retail environment as we implement strategies that will drive Target's long-term success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

Today, I'm going to provide an update on our efforts to reduce out of stocks and improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. Then I'll cover our current work to enable our existing supply chain infrastructure to operate more flexibly in support of our strategy. And finally, I'll turn to our efforts to elevate the store experience on behalf of our guests, including enhancements to the order pickup process. 
Many of you have told us that you noticed the improvement in our in-stock position in our stores, and our internal measures confirm what you have been seeing. Specifically, in the first quarter, we saw a 27% improvement in out-of-stock measures compared with the first quarter last year. This represents a sequential acceleration from our fourth quarter performance. And we are seeing improvements across all of our merchandise categories. 
Some of the in-stock improvement is being driven by additional inventory investments in its central categories, which drove a portion of our year-over-year increase in our inventory at the end of the quarter. However, we have opportunities to make other changes that will allow us to streamline our inventory position over time. 
Specifically, the team is taking a data-driven approach to reduce the number of SKUs in our assortment, making room for additional phasings of the best-selling, faster-turning items on our store shelves. In addition, the team is collaborating with vendors to reduce case pack sizes, which will reduce backroom inventory while increasing store labor efficiency by reducing the number of times an item is touched before it's displayed on shelves. 
Beyond these improvements, the out-of-stock team has successfully tested other enhancements that we'll roll out later this year. One test applied new replenishment algorithms for items with the regular demand patterns like Seasonal Sporting Goods. And the results of the test were dramatic as out of stocks improved by 50% on test items. 
Another test involves updates to our presentation standards for items that are typically purchased in multiples. This ensures that our minimum standards reflect the way guests are shopping today, allowing us to better optimize the trade-off between inventory investments and out of stocks. 
And with our vendor partners, the team has worked to meaningfully reduce shipping windows, which will enhance speed and reliability throughout the supply chain. We're very pleased with the collaboration we've seen from our vendors on this effort and improving ship from windows will be implemented across all merchandise categories by this fall. 
Beyond our work on in stocks, we're making changes in our distribution centers to modernize our capabilities. These changes will allow our existing infrastructure to operate more flexibly, simultaneously reducing shipping times while efficiently leveraging our entire network inventory on behalf of our guests. 
At our Financial Community Meeting in March, I outlined the conversion of 3 of our traditional regional distribution centers into delayed allocation centers, which can house slower-turning items with more variable demand, allowing the remaining DCs to process faster-turning SKUs more efficiently. In addition, these delayed allocation centers allow us to pulse the right amount of Seasonal inventory across the country throughout the season as demand patterns emerge, keeping us in stock longer in areas of unexpectedly high demand or reducing excess inventory in areas of unexpectedly low demand. 
We successfully completed the conversion of all 3 delayed allocation centers in the first quarter, and early results indicate that these additional nodes are improving product allocation compared with our past performance. 
Among our other regional DCs, this year as we're making changes to 3 facilities to enable them to ship directly to guests. This requires a meaningful transformation in the capabilities of these facilities as direct-to-guest shipments require the team to pick and pack individual items while shipments to stores require fast-moving shipments of case packs and pallets. Despite the challenge, we are excited about this work because like our ship-from-store capability, the ability to ship from our regional DCs directly to guests provides deeper access to network inventory, enhancing our digital in-stocks while allowing us to reach our guests more quickly while controlling costs. 
In addition, adding direct ship capability to one of our existing facilities requires 85% lower capital investment compared to the construction of a new dedicated web fulfillment center. As you know, a meaningful portion of our capital expenditures in recent years has been devoted to technology and supply chain. And we said that we expect these investments to continue in the future. 
At the same time, we know that investments in our store experience are more important than ever. And as a result, nearly $1 billion of our CapEx this year will be focused on the store experience. In addition to our store remodel program, which includes the LA25 stores Brian highlighted earlier, we continue to roll out new flexible format stores in dense urban and suburban areas. And we're really pleased with the performance of these new hyper localized stores so far. 
In addition, we continue to invest in presentation and experience across a broad set of our stores. This year, we're investing in self-checkout lanes, operational enhancements and merchandising innovations across a meaningful portion of the store base. 
A key area of focus in our stores is the elevation of our digital order pickup. And the team is taking steps to make the process more convenient and less transactional for our guests. Our goal in these efforts is to increase satisfaction with the order pickup experience, leading to more repeat usage of this capability by our guests. 
Speed is key, and our store teams continue to improve the speed with which they fulfill pick-up orders. In the first quarter, approximately 90% of orders were ready for pickup in less than an hour, up nearly 10 percentage points from last year. This is one reason that guest satisfaction regarding the pickup experience is up meaningfully from last year, and repeat usage is increasing as well. 
Despite this progress, we have more work to do. And we intend to continually improve our performance in response to guest feedback. To maintain our momentum, we rolled out streamlined order pickup communication to our guests this month. And in select stores, we are testing a separate pickup area with additional holding capacity, dedicated team members and enhanced merchandise presentation to encourage additional shopping on their store visit. 
While we are still early [ph] in our efforts, I am really pleased with the progress we've made in a short amount of time. By focusing on downstream outcomes and improving handoffs between every part of the supply chain from vendor to distribution center to our stores, we are making systematic, repeatable improvements which will sustain better operating metrics over time. 
Now I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"

As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of an unexpectedly choppy and weak environment.

As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of an unexpectedly choppy and weak environment. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was $0.19 higher than last year and $0.04 better than the high end of our guidance. First quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.02, $0.27 lower than the adjusted EPS, reflecting $0.26 of losses related to our debt tender offer and $0.01 of expense related to the sale of our pharmacy business. 
Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 1.2% was driven by growth -- both growth in traffic and ticket, average ticket. As expected, total sales declined from last year, reflecting the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS. Within the quarter, we experienced solid results through the Easter holiday. Post-Easter, sales and traffic trends softened noticeably, consistent with what you've heard from many of our competitors. 
Also notable in the first quarter, we saw a meaningful increase in the volatility of our weekly sales performance compared with last year. Not surprisingly, weather patterns caused some of this volatility as we saw a meaningful correlation between sales and temperature trends in different regions of the country. We continue to invest in our digital and flexible fulfillment capabilities to drive sales in all channels, and we continue to see strong results. Comparable digital sales increased 23% in the first quarter, on top of the 38% increase a year ago. 
REDcard penetration was 23.4% in the first quarter, up nearly 200 basis points from last year. This represents the addition of nearly 700,000 new credit and debit accounts in the quarter combined with the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding the impact of the pharmacy sales, penetration was up about 80 basis points from a year ago. 
Our team delivered a stronger-than-expected 11.5% EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter. On the gross margin line, we saw about 50 basis points of improvement from last year. This growth reflects the benefit of the sale of the pharmacy business and continued positive merchandise mix, driven by strength in signature categories. These benefits offset markdown pressure in an environment which continues to be very promotional. 
On the SG&A line, we saw the benefit of strong discipline across the organization along with the benefit from the sale of the pharmacy business. This allowed us to offset strategic investments we're making in our business, including our team. 
Altogether, first quarter SG&A expense was about 50 basis points better than last year. Quarter-end inventory was up a little bit more than 4%, rising faster than sales. As John mentioned, some of this growth reflected intentional inventory investments in -- to support in-stocks and essential categories. However, given the recent slowdown in our sales and our caution regarding the second quarter, we are planning to manage inventory carefully throughout this quarter and beyond. 
Turning to capital deployment. We returned $336 million to shareholders in the form of dividends this quarter and invested nearly $900 million in share repurchase. As Brian mentioned, we also took the opportunity to refinance some high-coupon debt during the quarter with the issuance of 10-year and 30-year bonds at very attractive rates. 
As a result, we recognized $261 million in debt retirement losses in first quarter GAAP EPS. And given that the settlement of -- on the last tranche of the debt tender occurred at the beginning of the second quarter, we expect to recognize another $161 million of debt retirement losses in second quarter GAAP EPS. 
Beyond these accounting losses, we expect this refinancing to reduce our ongoing interest expense by $5 million to $10 million per quarter. I want to pause here and discuss our quarter-end cash position. We ended the first quarter with about $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, essentially the same as when we started the quarter. However, this was the result of timing. And we expect to reduce our cash position by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter. In fact, already this quarter, we've deployed nearly $1 billion to retire the final tranche of the debt tender. And we expect to apply another $750 million to fund a debt maturity in July. When you combine these uses with continued investments in the dividend and share repurchase, we expect to end the second quarter with a cash balance of between $1 billion and $2 billion. 
I want to emphasize that our capital deployment priorities remain the same. We invest first in our business to support projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria; second, we support the dividend and expect to maintain our record of consecutive annual dividend increases since 1971; and finally, we invest in share repurchase within the limits of our A long-term credit rating. 
One of our longer-term financial goals is to increase our after-tax return on invested capital, and we expect to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next 5 years. And I'm pleased that we are already making meaningful progress on this metric. For the 12-month period through the first quarter, we reported an after-tax return of 16%, including the gain on the pharmacy sale in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding that gain, our after-tax return on invested capital was a very strong 14% in the first quarter, up about 150 basis points from a year ago. 
On another note, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was unusually low in the first quarter at 31.6%. This was the result of the adoption of a new accounting standard for employee share-based payments, which reduced our tax expense by $17 million combined with the impact of lower pretax earnings resulting from the loss on debt retirement. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the implications for the full year. While we're coming off a quarter of outstanding financial performance, Brian mentioned earlier with elevated short-term volatility and softer sales trends since Easter, it's clear that consumers are behaving more cautiously. 
With that backdrop, we are planning for second quarter comparable sales of flat to down 2%. This would represent slower than second quarter performance than we were planning at the beginning of the year. But we believe this outlook is prudent given the trends we see as many others have been seeing. Given slower-than-expected sales, we are planning for a moderate year-over-year decline in our second quarter EBITDA margin rate in a range of 40 basis points at the midpoint of our comp guidance. 
Compared with our plan going into the year, our updated expectations reflect continued gross margin pressure from a very promotional environment combined with a deleveraging of SG&A expense on floor sales. Altogether, we expect to generate second quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1 to $1.20. Given our performance over the last 1.5 years, we believe we're pursuing the right strategies, and our strategy is working. We have many levers we can deploy to drive our performance even if the environment remains challenging. As a result, even with a more tempered view of the second quarter, we are still focused on achieving full year adjusted EPS within the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. 
As we progress through the second quarter, all of us will gain more perspective, which will inform our outlook for the latter half of the year. As I mentioned at our Financial Community Meeting, one of my first priorities on joining this team last year was to dig in and understand in detail the factors that drive Target's financial performance. As a result of that view, I am confident in the resilience of our business model, which sustains our business through all consumer and retail environments. Importantly, our financial strength, combined with our business model, enable us to continue investing in our long-term priorities even when others are having to pull back. It's one of the many reasons I was so excited to join this team and this company last September. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I are happy to take your questions."

And as we looked at business in April and again in the start of May, we've seen a significant performance difference between our West Coast markets, and particularly, our Northeast markets and significant variability where we've seen some very positive growth performance across our entire portfolio in Los Angeles, in San Francisco and many of our core West Coast markets, offset by significant slowness in the Northeast, in Boston, in New York, in Philadelphia, in D.C. In given categories, we've seen dramatic performance differences. In the ready-to-wear category, on the West Coast and in parts of the Midwest where we've seen an earlier spring, we're seeing double-digit growth in ready-to-wear, offset by fairly significant declines in the Northeast. We had a review with our team yesterday. We looked at categories like fans. We have markets that are up 20%, and markets that are down 90%. So we're seeing volatility driven by certainly climate, but I think a number of other factors that we're certainly analyzing. Cathy talked about an earlier Easter. We've certainly looked at weather patterns. We recognize that year-on-year, fuel prices have increased. And our guess is the consumer is spending more than they did a year ago at the pump. And we certainly recognize that within overall categories, today's consumer, our guest, is reinvesting in their homes. They're spending money on home improvement. We've seen that in our Home category, which was up 4% in the first quarter. So a lot of volatility, and it's both geographic and within category mixes."

Where we have seen some trip erosion is with a guest who is coming in for that fill-in trip. So as we think about actions we're taking in our business right now, we want to continue to make sure we're serving the guest who's looking for that stock-up item, that stock-up trip. And we're going to be even more focused as we manage through the quarter and the balance of the year to make sure we're winning and driving more fill-in trips. So you'll see us enhance and change both our promotional calendar, our in-store presentation of more fill-in items to make sure that we're doing both, continuing to win with a guest who's shopping Target for that stock-up occasion, but also making sure we're capturing more of that fill-in trip throughout the quarter. So those are actions that we're taking right now. The team's working on making adjustments in our promotional cadence and presentation to make sure that we're doing both. We're continuing to win with the stock-up shopper, but we're also capturing more share of wallet with that fill-in guest. From a promotional standpoint, we would expect to see most of the intensity in the Apparel space, where we certainly recognize that many of our competitors are sitting on high levels of inventory. We've got to be prepared for continued promotional intensity in that space. And I think we're well positioned, as both Cathy and John have noted, to manage through that throughout the quarter."

So we recognize that even as we look at the start of 2016, the majority of the retail business in the United States continues to be done in stores, but it starts online. So we've got to have great digital capabilities to make sure when our guest is shopping Target, no matter how they shop, we make it a convenient, easy experience, so that has not changed dramatically.

And that value's expressed in more fill-in trips, buying smaller packs, smaller baskets. So again, it's not a shift in our strategy, it's a recognition that we have to do both. We have to continue to delight the guests when they come to Target for that big stock-up occasion, and we have to have the right assortment, the right value, the right presentation for that guest who's coming to us for the fill-in trip.

We've got to make sure we're delivering the right value, we're winning with both the stock-up and the fill-in trip. We're making sure that we have the right experience for our guests, whether shopping in-store and online. And we don't see any structural change in the consumer environment. We think this is a short-term bump in the road, but we think we're well positioned. And everything we see from a GDP and consumer confidence standpoint gives us the confidence that this is going to be a short-term impact. And we're going to see very solid results in both the third and fourth quarter and keep us on our long-term guidance track."

We know as the guests and our consumer has moved through the course of 2016, prices at the pump, fuel prices have risen, and that's certainly an impact. And then when we look at a macro basis on overall spending, we certainly recognize that consumers are spending more on travel, on leisure activities. They've been investing in their homes, as I mentioned before. But there's no structural change that gives us pause and has us changing our strategy, altering our outlook for the full year. We think we're continuing to improve our digital capabilities. I think our store experience is improving each and every week. The response we're getting from the guest based on changes we've made in Apparel and Home and recently in Food are very encouraging. As John mentioned, our flex format's performing quite well. So we feel confident that the content we have in place, the plans we have for the second half of the year, some of the enhancements we've made from a branding and in-store and online standpoint are going to continue to deliver solid results.

Before I start with prepared remarks, let me set up the structure for our call this morning. We want to make sure we spend significant time talking about our first quarter results, and Cathy and John and I will cover both our first quarter performance, but also talk about the second quarter outlook. But we are going to make sure we leave significant time for Q&A. We want to make sure we have time today to address your questions, provide additional insights into our first quarter performance and the factors that are guiding our outlook for Q2. 
Let me start with the first quarter. Our team delivered outstanding first quarter financial results in a very challenging consumer environment, which became softer and more volatile as the quarter progressed. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was well beyond the high end of the guidance for the quarter and more than 16% ahead of the $1.10 last year. These results demonstrate the value of our strategy in the face of more challenging consumer landscape. 
First quarter comparable sales growth was driven by an increase in both traffic and average ticket as traffic grew in both our stores and digital channels. Comparable digital sales grew 23% in the first quarter on top of 38% a year ago. 
We generated very healthy profit margins on our sales in the quarter as our team did a great job managing the business in the face of a number of headwinds, particularly following the Easter holiday. As planned, our first quarter gross margin rate reflected the benefits of the sale of our pharmacy business, favorable merchandising mix and our cost-savings initiatives. These benefits allowed us to offset markdown pressure in a very promotional environment. 
The team also delivered on the expense line, which benefited from the pharmacy sale and cost initiatives, offsetting pressure from investments we've made in our business, including our team. Cathy will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Sales in the quarter came in lighter than expected, and daily and regional shopping patterns were more volatile than in the prior periods. While guests generally maintained their pattern of larger pantry stocking visits, we saw a slowdown in growth of smaller convenience trips. 
Against that background, our results show that our strategy continues to resonate with our guests as comparable sales in our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness, grew more than 3x as fast as the company average. Given the concentration of signature categories in Home and Apparel, comparable sales in both categories outperformed the company, driving market share gains in both areas. 
Comps in Home grew nearly 4%, led by strength in domestics, decor and seasonal areas. Highlights included our Kids Home assortment, which saw comp sales in the mid-teens, driven by the successful launch of our new Pillowfort brand. We were also pleased with the results from our partnership with Marimekko, which attracted guests to explore our assortment in stores and digital, driving sales in both Home and Apparel. 
Overall comps in Apparel grew between 2% and 3%, led by sales in Baby, Kids and Women's ready-to-wear. Rapid growth in ready-to-wear is especially notable given the tough comparison from last year. Specifically, the 2-year stack of the first quarter comp sales in ready-to-wear is more than 16% higher than 2 years ago. 
First quarter comps in Food were down slightly as an increase in perishable was offset by a decline in center store grocery. While results were impacted by deflation in some categories, they also reflected a meaningful disruption from the reset of our center store grocery area, which was executed in stores across the country in April. 
Despite the disruption, this effort better positions us for success over the longer term as we've implemented changes to assortment, presentation and category adjacencies. Specifically, we've updated assortment and segmentation to align with local demographics and showcase wellness. And we integrated nutrition bars into the center store floor pad, creating an industry-leading destination for these items. 
In total, we added about 1,000 new items with this reset, including 55 new better-for-you brands across 25 categories. And we've incorporated our Simply Balanced brand into an additional 30 categories. This represents an important step in the reinvention of our Grocery business. Following the reset, we received very positive guest feedback. And the subsequent results have been better than expected. 
Within Hardlines, we saw a high single-digit increase in the first quarter of comparable sales in Toys even as we comped over high single-digit growth last year. Offsetting the growth in Toys, we saw declines in Electronics and Entertainment, reflecting the secular challenges these categories continue to face. These declines put about 70 basis points of pressure on our first quarter comparable sales growth. 
I want to pause and welcome Mark Tritton, who'll be joining our team as the EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer, overseeing our enterprise buying, sourcing, product design development and merchandising operations. We've conducted an exhaustive search for a new CMO, and I'm confident Mark is the right leader for our merchandising team. Mark comes to us with a wealth of retail and merchandising experience, including positions at Nike, Timberland and Nordstrom, where Mark doubled their private label business. Mark is a bold, decisive and visionary retail leader, and we're excited to have him on our Target team. 
Once again this quarter, we were able to return a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Altogether, we returned more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, up from just under $900 million a year ago. 
In addition, given our strong financial position, this quarter, we were able to refinance some high-cost debt by issuing new debt at very attractive rates. Cathy will provide more detail in a few minutes. 
As we look ahead, we're approaching our business with appropriate caution as sales trends at Target and many of our key competitors weakened and became more volatile in the first quarter. In addition, many of our competitors are sitting on meaningful excess inventory, which we expect will extend a very intense promotional environment into the months ahead. 
Despite our near-term caution, we'll continue to execute the long-term strategy vision that we laid out 18 months ago, the vision which has been shaping our results ever since. We're very excited about the launch of our new Kids Apparel brand, Cat & Jack, which we'll roll out in the second quarter. And we'll continue to invest in quality through our owned and exclusive brand assortment with a particular emphasis on signature categories. 
We'll continue to work to enhance our Food offering to become more fresh and local with more natural and clean label offerings. And we'll continue to partner with our colleagues at CVS to complete the rebranding of our pharmacies within our stores. Following the rebranding effort, we'll collaborate with CVS on an awareness campaign to ensure that both our guests and members of their PBM businesses are aware of the change within our stores. 
As John will describe in a few minutes, we're also investing in store experience and flexible fulfillment capabilities, while modernizing our supply chain to become more agile in the way we serve our guests. We're very excited to be near completion of our LA25 remodels, which began more -- before the holiday season. And we're eager to gain guest feedback to determine which enhancements we'll roll out more broadly in the future. 
And finally, we're making investments in our team, adding specialized talent like new visual merchandising leaders, who are ensuring the store presentation in our Style categories highlight the investments we're making to enhance quality and innovation. Going forward, we'll continue to look for ways to simplify processes in our stores, bringing up time for our team to focus on serving our guests. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to thank the entire Target team for their tireless work on behalf of our business and our guests. As we've said many times, we have the best team in retail, both in our stores and our headquarters. And I'm continually inspired by their passion to drive Target's success by better serving our guests. With this outstanding team, a strong brand, great-looking stores, a resilient business model and a strong balance sheet, I'm confident we'll successfully navigate the near-term retail environment as we implement strategies that will drive Target's long-term success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will discuss his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

Then I'll cover our current work to enable our existing supply chain infrastructure to operate more flexibly in support of our strategy. And finally, I'll turn to our efforts to elevate the store experience on behalf of our guests, including enhancements to the order pickup process. 
Many of you have told us that you noticed the improvement in our in-stock position in our stores, and our internal measures confirm what you have been seeing. Specifically, in the first quarter, we saw a 27% improvement in out-of-stock measures compared with the first quarter last year. This represents a sequential acceleration from our fourth quarter performance. And we are seeing improvements across all of our merchandise categories. 
Some of the in-stock improvement is being driven by additional inventory investments in its central categories, which drove a portion of our year-over-year increase in our inventory at the end of the quarter. However, we have opportunities to make other changes that will allow us to streamline our inventory position over time. 
Specifically, the team is taking a data-driven approach to reduce the number of SKUs in our assortment, making room for additional phasings of the best-selling, faster-turning items on our store shelves. In addition, the team is collaborating with vendors to reduce case pack sizes, which will reduce backroom inventory while increasing store labor efficiency by reducing the number of times an item is touched before it's displayed on shelves. 
Beyond these improvements, the out-of-stock team has successfully tested other enhancements that we'll roll out later this year. One test applied new replenishment algorithms for items with the regular demand patterns like Seasonal Sporting Goods. And the results of the test were dramatic as out of stocks improved by 50% on test items. 
Another test involves updates to our presentation standards for items that are typically purchased in multiples. This ensures that our minimum standards reflect the way guests are shopping today, allowing us to better optimize the trade-off between inventory investments and out of stocks. 
And with our vendor partners, the team has worked to meaningfully reduce shipping windows, which will enhance speed and reliability throughout the supply chain. We're very pleased with the collaboration we've seen from our vendors on this effort and improving ship from windows will be implemented across all merchandise categories by this fall. 
Beyond our work on in stocks, we're making changes in our distribution centers to modernize our capabilities. These changes will allow our existing infrastructure to operate more flexibly, simultaneously reducing shipping times while efficiently leveraging our entire network inventory on behalf of our guests. 
At our Financial Community Meeting in March, I outlined the conversion of 3 of our traditional regional distribution centers into delayed allocation centers, which can house slower-turning items with more variable demand, allowing the remaining DCs to process faster-turning SKUs more efficiently. In addition, these delayed allocation centers allow us to pulse the right amount of Seasonal inventory across the country throughout the season as demand patterns emerge, keeping us in stock longer in areas of unexpectedly high demand or reducing excess inventory in areas of unexpectedly low demand. 
We successfully completed the conversion of all 3 delayed allocation centers in the first quarter, and early results indicate that these additional nodes are improving product allocation compared with our past performance. 
Among our other regional DCs, this year as we're making changes to 3 facilities to enable them to ship directly to guests. This requires a meaningful transformation in the capabilities of these facilities as direct-to-guest shipments require the team to pick and pack individual items while shipments to stores require fast-moving shipments of case packs and pallets. Despite the challenge, we are excited about this work because like our ship-from-store capability, the ability to ship from our regional DCs directly to guests provides deeper access to network inventory, enhancing our digital in-stocks while allowing us to reach our guests more quickly while controlling costs. 
In addition, adding direct ship capability to one of our existing facilities requires 85% lower capital investment compared to the construction of a new dedicated web fulfillment center. As you know, a meaningful portion of our capital expenditures in recent years has been devoted to technology and supply chain. And we said that we expect these investments to continue in the future. 
At the same time, we know that investments in our store experience are more important than ever. And as a result, nearly $1 billion of our CapEx this year will be focused on the store experience. In addition to our store remodel program, which includes the LA25 stores Brian highlighted earlier, we continue to roll out new flexible format stores in dense urban and suburban areas. And we're really pleased with the performance of these new hyper localized stores so far. 
In addition, we continue to invest in presentation and experience across a broad set of our stores. This year, we're investing in self-checkout lanes, operational enhancements and merchandising innovations across a meaningful portion of the store base. 
A key area of focus in our stores is the elevation of our digital order pickup. And the team is taking steps to make the process more convenient and less transactional for our guests. Our goal in these efforts is to increase satisfaction with the order pickup experience, leading to more repeat usage of this capability by our guests. 
Speed is key, and our store teams continue to improve the speed with which they fulfill pick-up orders. In the first quarter, approximately 90% of orders were ready for pickup in less than an hour, up nearly 10 percentage points from last year. This is one reason that guest satisfaction regarding the pickup experience is up meaningfully from last year, and repeat usage is increasing as well. 
Despite this progress, we have more work to do. And we intend to continually improve our performance in response to guest feedback. To maintain our momentum, we rolled out streamlined order pickup communication to our guests this month. And in select stores, we are testing a separate pickup area with additional holding capacity, dedicated team members and enhanced merchandise presentation to encourage additional shopping on their store visit. 
While we are still early [ph] in our efforts, I am really pleased with the progress we've made in a short amount of time. By focusing on downstream outcomes and improving handoffs between every part of the supply chain from vendor to distribution center to our stores, we are making systematic, repeatable improvements which will sustain better operating metrics over time. 
Now I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"

As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of an unexpectedly choppy and weak environment. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was $0.19 higher than",1362,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter even in the face of an unexpectedly choppy and weak environment. 
Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was $0.19 higher than last year and $0.04 better than the high end of our guidance. First quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.02, $0.27 lower than the adjusted EPS, reflecting $0.26 of losses related to our debt tender offer and $0.01 of expense related to the sale of our pharmacy business. 
Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 1.2% was driven by growth -- both growth in traffic and ticket, average ticket. As expected, total sales declined from last year, reflecting the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS. Within the quarter, we experienced solid results through the Easter holiday. Post-Easter, sales and traffic trends softened noticeably, consistent with what you've heard from many of our competitors. 
Also notable in the first quarter, we saw a meaningful increase in the volatility of our weekly sales performance compared with last year. Not surprisingly, weather patterns caused some of this volatility as we saw a meaningful correlation between sales and temperature trends in different regions of the country. We continue to invest in our digital and flexible fulfillment capabilities to drive sales in all channels, and we continue to see strong results. Comparable digital sales increased 23% in the first quarter, on top of the 38% increase a year ago. 
REDcard penetration was 23.4% in the first quarter, up nearly 200 basis points from last year. This represents the addition of nearly 700,000 new credit and debit accounts in the quarter combined with the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding the impact of the pharmacy sales, penetration was up about 80 basis points from a year ago. 
Our team delivered a stronger-than-expected 11.5% EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter. On the gross margin line, we saw about 50 basis points of improvement from last year. This growth reflects the benefit of the sale of the pharmacy business and continued positive merchandise mix, driven by strength in signature categories. These benefits offset markdown pressure in an environment which continues to be very promotional. 
On the SG&A line, we saw the benefit of strong discipline across the organization along with the benefit from the sale of the pharmacy business. This allowed us to offset strategic investments we're making in our business, including our team. 
Altogether, first quarter SG&A expense was about 50 basis points better than last year. Quarter-end inventory was up a little bit more than 4%, rising faster than sales. As John mentioned, some of this growth reflected intentional inventory investments in -- to support in-stocks and essential categories. However, given the recent slowdown in our sales and our caution regarding the second quarter, we are planning to manage inventory carefully throughout this quarter and beyond. 
Turning to capital deployment. We returned $336 million to shareholders in the form of dividends this quarter and invested nearly $900 million in share repurchase. As Brian mentioned, we also took the opportunity to refinance some high-coupon debt during the quarter with the issuance of 10-year and 30-year bonds at very attractive rates. 
As a result, we recognized $261 million in debt retirement losses in first quarter GAAP EPS. And given that the settlement of -- on the last tranche of the debt tender occurred at the beginning of the second quarter, we expect to recognize another $161 million of debt retirement losses in second quarter GAAP EPS. 
Beyond these accounting losses, we expect this refinancing to reduce our ongoing interest expense by $5 million to $10 million per quarter. I want to pause here and discuss our quarter-end cash position. We ended the first quarter with about $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, essentially the same as when we started the quarter. However, this was the result of timing. And we expect to reduce our cash position by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter. In fact, already this quarter, we've deployed nearly $1 billion to retire the final tranche of the debt tender. And we expect to apply another $750 million to fund a debt maturity in July. When you combine these uses with continued investments in the dividend and share repurchase, we expect to end the second quarter with a cash balance of between $1 billion and $2 billion. 
I want to emphasize that our capital deployment priorities remain the same. We invest first in our business to support projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria; second, we support the dividend and expect to maintain our record of consecutive annual dividend increases since 1971; and finally, we invest in share repurchase within the limits of our A long-term credit rating. 
One of our longer-term financial goals is to increase our after-tax return on invested capital, and we expect to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next 5 years. And I'm pleased that we are already making meaningful progress on this metric. For the 12-month period through the first quarter, we reported an after-tax return of 16%, including the gain on the pharmacy sale in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding that gain, our after-tax return on invested capital was a very strong 14% in the first quarter, up about 150 basis points from a year ago. 
On another note, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was unusually low in the first quarter at 31.6%. This was the result of the adoption of a new accounting standard for employee share-based payments, which reduced our tax expense by $17 million combined with the impact of lower pretax earnings resulting from the loss on debt retirement. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the implications for the full year. While we're coming off a quarter of outstanding financial performance, Brian mentioned earlier with elevated short-term volatility and softer sales trends since Easter, it's clear that consumers are behaving more cautiously. 
With that backdrop, we are planning for second quarter comparable sales of flat to down 2%. This would represent slower than second quarter performance than we were planning at the beginning of the year. But we believe this outlook is prudent given the trends we see as many others have been seeing. Given slower-than-expected sales, we are planning for a moderate year-over-year decline in our second quarter EBITDA margin rate in a range of 40 basis points at the midpoint of our comp guidance. 
Compared with our plan going into the year, our updated expectations reflect continued gross margin pressure from a very promotional environment combined with a deleveraging of SG&A expense on floor sales. Altogether, we expect to generate second quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1 to $1.20. Given our performance over the last 1.5 years, we believe we're pursuing the right strategies, and our strategy is working. We have many levers we can deploy to drive our performance even if the environment remains challenging. As a result, even with a more tempered view of the second quarter, we are still focused on achieving full year adjusted EPS within the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. 
As we progress through the second quarter, all of us will gain more perspective, which will inform our outlook for the latter half of the year. As I mentioned at our Financial Community Meeting, one of my first priorities on joining this team last year was to dig in and understand in detail the factors that drive Target's financial performance. As a result of that view, I am confident in the resilience of our business model, which sustains our business through all consumer and retail environments. Importantly, our financial strength, combined with our business model, enable us to continue investing in our long-term priorities even when others are having to pull back. It's one of the many reasons I was so excited to join this team and this company last September. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I are happy to take your questions."

And as we looked at business in April and again in the start of May, we've seen a significant performance difference between our West Coast markets, and particularly, our Northeast markets and significant variability where we've seen some very positive growth performance across our entire portfolio in Los Angeles, in San Francisco and many of our core West Coast markets, offset by significant slowness in the Northeast, in Boston, in New York, in Philadelphia, in D.C. In given categories, we've seen dramatic performance differences. In the ready-to-wear category, on the West Coast and in parts of the Midwest where we've seen an earlier spring, we're seeing double-digit growth in ready-to-wear, offset by fairly significant declines in the Northeast. We had a review with our team yesterday. We looked at categories like fans. We have markets that are up 20%, and markets that are down 90%. So we're seeing volatility driven by certainly climate, but I think a number of other factors that we're certainly analyzing. Cathy talked about an earlier Easter. We've certainly looked at weather patterns. We recognize that year-on-year, fuel prices have increased. And our guess is the consumer is spending more than they did a year ago at the pump. And we certainly recognize that within overall categories, today's consumer, our guest, is reinvesting in their homes. They're spending money on home improvement. We've seen that in our Home category, which was up 4% in the first quarter. So a lot of volatility, and it's both geographic and within category mixes."

So as we think about actions we're taking in our business right now, we want to continue to make sure we're serving the guest who's looking for that stock-up item, that stock-up trip. And we're going to be even more focused as we manage through the quarter and the balance of the year to make sure we're winning and driving more fill-in trips. So you'll see us enhance and change both our promotional calendar, our in-store presentation of more fill-in items to make sure that we're doing both, continuing to win with a guest who's shopping Target for that stock-up occasion, but also making sure we're capturing more of that fill-in trip throughout the quarter. So those are actions that we're taking right now. The team's working on making adjustments in our promotional cadence and presentation to make sure that we're doing both. We're continuing to win with the stock-up shopper, but we're also capturing more share of wallet with that fill-in guest. From a promotional standpoint, we would expect to see most of the intensity in the Apparel space, where we certainly recognize that many of our competitors are sitting on high levels of inventory.

One of the things that we're certainly recognizing as we look at 2016 shopping patterns is there is a consumer and a guest who continues to look for value. And that value's expressed in more fill-in trips, buying smaller packs, smaller baskets. So again, it's not a shift in our strategy, it's a recognition that we have to do both. We have to continue to delight the guests when they come to Target for that big stock-up occasion, and we have to have the right assortment, the right value, the right presentation for that guest who's coming to us for the fill-in trip.

And for all of our center store dry grocery items, we moved every one of those aisles in all of our stores. So significant disruption for the guest. Short term, it certainly has an impact on our performance in Grocery and Food. But as we've made the changes, the response we're seeing from the guests is very encouraging. They're recognizing the new assortment, the new brands, more local items, the fact that we have more organic and gluten-free items on our shelves. And in many of these categories like the significant change we made in bars, we're seeing very strong sales results coming out of the reset. So it was an investment we had to make in both labor and in disruption to make sure we continue to move forward in the reinvention of Food. So short term, it had a meaningful impact on our Food sales, but we certainly expect to see the recovery over the balance of this year as we provide a more relevant assortment to our Target Grocery shopper."

We're very excited about the early results of Pillowfort and feel as if when we launch our new Cat & Jack brand for Kids, that is going to be another potential $1 billion brand in our portfolio. So great progress from a category role and signature category standpoint. As John mentioned during his remarks, our flex formats continue to be very well received as we move into new urban markets. We're excited about our TriBeCa store that we'll open up in October. But we've been excited about every one of these new flex formats, and they've been well received in both urban and college markets. We continue to think we've got significant opportunities in localization and the work we've done in Chicago. And now, Los Angeles just continues to confirm that. So our strategy continues to perform well. John and the team continue to enhance our store and supply chain capabilities to continue to meet the needs of our guests. So as we sit here today, there's no significant change in our strategy. But tactically, we recognize the consumer environment is tougher. We've got to make sure we're delivering the right value, we're winning with both the stock-up and the fill-in trip. We're making sure that we have the right experience for our guests, whether shopping in-store and online. And we don't see any structural change in the consumer environment.

We think we're continuing to improve our digital capabilities. I think our store experience is improving each and every week. The response we're getting from the guest based on changes we've made in Apparel and Home and recently in Food are very encouraging. As John mentioned, our flex format's performing quite well.

Our second quarter comparable sales decline of 1.1% was near the middle of our guidance range for the quarter but well below the results we expect to deliver over time.

Our second quarter comparable sales decline of 1.1% was near the middle of our guidance range for the quarter but well below the results we expect to deliver over time. Against that backdrop, we reported much stronger-than-expected profitability. This outperformance was driven by our ongoing costs-saving efforts, which benefited both our gross margin and expense rates in the second quarter. These benefits helped to offset pressure from the current promotional environment, declining comp sales and the investments we're making in our team. I want to pause and thank our team for delivering this outstanding financial performance. 
At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are committed, first and foremost, to restoring positive comp sales growth in the quarters and years ahead. Based on the conversations with many of you, we know there's a great deal of focus on the broad macro challenges facing retailers, including a consumer focused on experiences, the impact of price deflation and a channel shift into digital. These are real challenges, but they are not new to our business. With the right strategy and strong execution, we've demonstrated our ability to perform in the face of those challenges, and our expectation is that we will continue to be a top retail performer over time. 
In the second quarter, our #1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories, and consistent with the first quarter, we saw higher-than-normal variability in sales patterns. Despite these challenges, we're encouraged that we saw the strongest sales performance around key second quarter events, including Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and the beginning of the Back-to-School season. 
As we analyze the drivers of our second quarter performance, we've identified some company-specific challenges we are actively addressing. This includes meaningful pressure in Electronics, where we saw a double-digit decline in comp sales this quarter, accounting for approximately 70 basis points of overall comp decline. Notably, about 1/3 of this pressure was driven by Apple products, which were down more than 20% in the quarter. We're focused on reversing these trends, and we're collaborating with Apple and other vendor partners to evolve our assortment and accelerate innovation to deliver stronger sales. 
In Grocery, despite improvements in assortments, quality, freshness, presentation and in-stock, we were disappointed with our sales performance as we saw a small comp sales decline in the second quarter. While our Grocery business was negatively impacted by Food deflation, which accounted for about 20 basis points of pressure, we clearly have more work to do to unlock the growth potential in this important category. Given our recent performance and the increasingly competitive Food environment, we're revisiting our second half Grocery efforts, from presentation to assortment to promotion, to improve our competitive position. And as I will discuss in a few minutes, we'll be leveraging the learning from our LA25 remodels to help guide our plans going forward. Beyond Food, we are rebalancing our messaging and promotion to ensure we continue to drive strong performance in Style categories and reach consumers who are intently focused on value in this environment. 
Finally, we experienced soft second quarter traffic trends in the pharmacies in our stores as we completed the rebranding transition from Target to CVS across the country. The execution of the transition went very smoothly, and we've been very pleased with the level of collaboration between our teams and our partners at CVS. While it's not surprising that the rebranding activity has resulted in some near-term disruption, we're focused on restoring growth in this traffic-driving area in our stores. 
As a result, we're working closely with our partners at CVS as they launch media, marketing and member engagement campaigns to increase awareness and utilization of CVS pharmacies in our stores. In addition, CVS is executing an in-store engagement campaign and plans to offer special flu shot incentives at the pharmacies in our stores. As we take steps to increase awareness of the CVS-Target partnership, both among our guests and members of the CVS PBM business, we expect to reaccelerate pharmacy traffic in our stores over time. 
Despite this quarter's challenges, we're pleased that the fundamental elements of our strategy are continuing to shape our results. Comparable sales in signature categories continue to lead the company, reflecting investments we've made in quality, presentation and marketing. In the second quarter, comp sales growth in these categories outpaced the company by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Within signature, we saw particular strength in both Kids and Style. Results in Kids reflected the launch of Cat & Jack, which is now positioned to become our biggest own brand. After the July rollout of this brand, we saw double-digit growth in Cat & Jack sales when measured against comparable sales of Circo and Cherokee last year. 
Within Style, we continue to benefit from strength in women's Apparel. We saw a mid-single-digit comp increase in the quarter. This performance was dribbled -- driven by double-digit growth in our Xhilaration brand, which is focused on a younger style-savvy guest. In addition, we're really pleased with the performance of Who What Wear, which is one of the most productive brands on our women's floor plan [ph]. As a result, we're expanding the range of this assortment for the fall, inviting more of our guests to enjoy the items from this fashion-forward collaboration. 
Digital sales grew more than 16% in the second quarter on top of 30% growth last year. We continue to invest in Target's digital assets to enhance the guest experience and drive sales in all channels, and our results demonstrate the impact of the investments we've made over time. For example, several years ago, we told you we had an opportunity to improve our digital conversion. Since then, we've invested to improve our conversion performance by streamlining online checkouts, making the site more appealing and easy to use, enhancing our personalization capabilities and improving search. 
As a result, for several years in a row, we've seen meaningful improvement in our digital conversion across all platforms, particularly in mobile. In the second quarter, we launched a brand-new fully adaptive site, which means we now provide a seamless experience across all platforms, from desktop to tablets to smartphones. This is increasingly important because, for many guests, a single purchase journey crosses over 2 or more of these digital devices. 
We're really pleased with the results in our new flexible-format stores, which are designed for very dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. These stores allow us to operate in areas we've never been able to serve with our largest-format stores, allowing us to extend our reach to consumers with high affinity for our brand. In July, we opened up new flex-format stores in Washington Square in Philadelphia, Lincoln Park in Chicago, Commonwealth in Boston and Forest Hills in Queens. We're excited to be serving guests in these iconic neighborhoods, and the guest response to these new locations has been fantastic. 
Financially, flexible formats are very successful. The sales productivity is much higher than our company average, and they've been meeting or exceeding our profit targets. In total this year, we're planning to open 14 flex-format stores, including a multilevel location in TriBeCa this October. Based on our experience to date and our investments and capabilities, we're increasingly confident in our ability to successfully open and operate stores in a variety of neighborhood settings across the country. As a result, we're accelerating our pipeline of locations we can open in future years, and we expect flex-format stores to be a key driver of future growth. 
In our existing stores, we continue to invest in presentation and experience, particularly in signature categories. We completed the remodeling of our LA25 test stores in the second quarter, and we're in the early stages of a robust learning plan to measure guest reaction to the changes we've made. Overall, we're encouraged by initial results in these stores, and we're already rolling out some of the innovations from these stores more broadly. Namely, we're pleased with the presentation innovation in home and Apparel and results from our work to elevate the order pickup experience. So we're already extending these innovations beyond the LA market. 
In addition, the changes we've made to the Food area in the LA25 test stores has really resonated with guests. Grocery sales in these stores are trending 2 to 3 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Relative performance in produce is even stronger, driving perishable comps that are more than 5 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. 
Guests have told us the new Food area now feels more intimate and separate from the rest of the store, providing a distinct Grocery shopping experience they prefer. We're very encouraged with these initial observations, and we'll continue to leverage learning from these stores as we work to improve Grocery performance across the chain. 
We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates a lot of cash even in challenging times. This cash allows us to make long-term investments in our business while returning cash to our shareholders at the same time. In June, we announced that our board had approved a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend, supporting our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. In addition, our cash position allowed us to return well over $1 billion through share repurchase in the second quarter in support of our goal to return $3.5 billion or more this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very excited about the Back-to-School and Back-to-College season, which is second only to the fourth quarter holiday season in terms of importance. In Back-to-School, we continue to work with kids and parents to inform our product design and development process. So it's only natural that this year, we engaged with kids to design and execute our Back-to-School marketing campaign. Kids led all aspects of this campaign: drafting storyboards, illustrating creative content, directing the spots and performing the music. 
To make shopping fast and convenient for busy families, this year, we partnered with teacherlists.com to make nearly 1 million school supply lists available with our School List Assist tool on target.com. This tool allows parents to quickly and seamlessly purchase supplies off their kids' class lists, arrange for Store Pickup or have the items delivered directly to their home. 
In Back-to-College, our marketing campaign is designed around today's students with their digital needs [ph]. In this campaign, we're partnering with 3 recent graduates to create inspiring, do-it-yourself videos to help college students make their new dorm room or apartment feel like home. In addition, we provided tools to make college shopping convenient and fun, including college registry, order pickup, subscriptions and special offers on Cartwheel. As we've done for more than 15 years, we're hosting Back-to-College after-hour shopping event, which will take place at 85 colleges and universities in the next couple of months. In these events, we provide free bus transportation from campus and provide students the opportunity to stock up and save on everything they'll need for school. 
I want to pause here and mention how happy we are to have Mark Tritton on the Target team. Mark took on the role of Chief Merchandising Officer in the second quarter, and he spent the last couple of months getting to know his team and becoming immersed in our business. Mark is creative and passionate about retail. He's had an amazing career building iconic brands, and I'm confident he'll be able to grow both our own brands and our Target brand. Mark is planning to speak on this conference call next quarter, when he'll outline our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
We continue to believe we're focused on the right strategic priorities, and we're confident in our ability to grow profitably over time. We believe it's appropriate to update our sales and EPS outlook for the remainder of the year. Our decision is informed by the retail sales environment and the variability we continue to see in our weekly and regional results. While we are laser-focused on accelerating traffic and sales, it's prudent to build near-term business and inventory plans that are consistent with recent trends. As always, we'll be prepared to flex those plans upward if results begin to recover in the second half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to spend a second with a special thank you to our team and our stores. I visit our stores around the country nearly every week, and I'm so grateful to have a group of such smart and friendly team members serving our guests. John's team at headquarters is focused on ways to simplify our processes, modernize our supply chain and help ensure our stores feature the right assortment of items that are in stock every day. When we back up an outstanding team with the right business fundamentals, we offer an unparalleled experience in retail. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who'll provide more details on his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It's long been a key point of differentiation for our brand. What I didn't fully appreciate until I came into my new role",1230,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It's long been a key point of differentiation for our brand. 
What I didn't fully appreciate until I came into my new role as COO was the workload that our supply chain [ph] processes have been driving into our stores. Historically, when we design processes to improve upstream efficiencies in our supply chain, we often achieve those benefits by moving work and complexity into our stores. 
One of the key priorities of my new team has been to look at the entire supply chain and find ways to optimize it end to end to deliver reliability for our guests while driving [ph] efficiency for the organization as a whole. A key measure of reliability is our ability to stay in stock, and I'm pleased that we continue to see improvement even as we begin to compare against improvements from a year ago. 
In stores, as we entered the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons, Target's overall out-of-stock position was better than we have ever measured historically. In addition, out of stocks on frequency and commodity items, the items which reliability is most important for our guests, are in an even stronger position. 
And in the digital channel, while we have much work yet to do, we have already reduced out of stocks by more than 50% in the last 6 months. Our work to reduce variability in our distribution centers has been one of the drivers of these improvements. In the past, an unacceptable number of vendor shipments were received by our DCs either too early or too late. This variability drove a lot of pressure workload in the DCs while reducing our reliability downstream. As a result, this year, we have been collaborating with our vendors to increase the percentage shipments that arrive on the correct date, and we've already seen meaningful progress. The percentage shipments that arrive on time has more than doubled, and we expect to see additional improvement as we roll out new processes to additional vendors over time. 
As shipments arrive at our distribution centers, we made changes to the prioritization of inbound processing, which have already cut the time to unload trailers by more than 50%, and we believe we can cut that time even further. In addition, we've improved process flow between our import warehouses and our regional DCs, reducing the average time it takes for an item in an import warehouse to reach the store shelves by more than half. 
We're also focused on our outbound processing with the goal of enabling daily deliveries to every store throughout the week regardless of a store sales volume. When implemented, this change will drive additional improvements to store in-stocks while reducing backroom inventory and store workload. 
I want to thank the entire team from merchandise planning to our distribution centers, logistics teams and our stores for these improvements. Without the engagement of the entire end-to-end supply chain, we couldn't have made such amazing progress. 
Before I move on to our work in the stores, I want to comment briefly on our overall inventory position. As we mentioned over the last several quarters, a portion of our year-over-year inventory growth reflects intentional investments we're making in nonseasonal commodity categories to support in-stock improvement on items most important our guests. 
In addition, our second quarter inventory reflected an investment to offer additional items in certain categories as we work with merchant teams to reliably offer appropriate assortment, both online and in our stores, to best serve our guests. Beyond our upstream supply chain work, our investment in self-checkout lanes is also reducing store workload, freeing up time for our store teams to focus on guest service while providing our guests a checkout option that many of them prefer. As of today, we have self checkout in just over 1,000 of our stores. We're planning to add another 200 stores by the end of the year, and we will continue the rollout through 2017. 
In stores with self checkout, nearly 1/3 of transactions go through these lanes, much higher than our initial projections. Our flexible fulfillment initiatives, including Store Pickup and ship-from-store, are one way we're reinvesting store labor savings to serve guests in new ways. At the end of 2015, more than 460 stores were shipping items directly to guest homes, and we're planning to double our capacity this year by expanding this capability to more than 500 additional stores. These additional locations will further improve our average ship time while providing deeper access to our store inventories, increasing the likelihood that we can ship a guest's entire order from a single nearby store location. 
And importantly, because we are now prepositioning high velocity web-only items in the back room of ship-from-store locations, we are able to reduce last mile and split shipment expenses dramatically. 
In-store pickup is an increasingly popular option for many of our guests. This year, we've seen 50% growth in pick-up orders on top of 60% growth a year ago. Year-to-date, more than 90% of our pick-up orders have been ready in 1 hour, and we've implemented process improvements to reduce wait times in stores. As a result, guest satisfaction with the pick-up experience is up from a year ago, and a higher percent of guests are repeatedly using this service. 
To prepare for this holiday season surge, we're investing to ensure our stores can continue to deliver a great pickup experience in the face of rapidly increasing demand. In 75 of our highest volume stores, we're increasing holding capacity to allow our team to retreat items more quickly even during peak times. We're also investing in additional digital devices to support peak demand, and across all of our stores, we're rolling out new guidance on how our stores can optimize their storage space to enhance speed and efficiency. 
New this year, we've implemented systems and processes to allow stores to forecast and monitor pick-up demand, ensuring we maintain proper staffing levels. In addition, during the holiday season, about 300 stores will be testing separate branded shirts for the team members in the pickup area and distinctive bags for pick-up orders to underscore our commitment to this experience. 
Finally, as Brian mentioned, Back-to-School, Back-to-College season is our second most important sales driver of the year. As a result, we're planning to carefully measure our pickup reliability and speed during promotional peaks this quarter so we can apply those learnings in time for the holiday season when peak demand will be even higher. 
It was just a year ago that I began working with my new team. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished since then. However, I'm also energized by the opportunities still ahead of us to further increase the speed, flexibility and reliability of our supply chain, to drive unnecessary workload out of our stores and to enable operational excellence across the organization. As we work to accomplish these goals, I'm fortunate to work with an experienced team, led by both internal talent and some amazing new hires, and I'm confident that with their leadership, we will continue to improve Target's operations on behalf of our guests. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"
174438,344500266,1036292,"Target Corp., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, d",1502,"Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.17 of debt retirement costs due to settlement timing on a subset of our first quarter debt tender offers. 
This quarter's profit performance was quite impressive in light of the challenging sales environment. Specifically, comparable sales declined 1.1% this quarter, in line with our guidance and well below our plan at the beginning of the year. As expected, the total sales in the second quarter were down more than 7% from last year, driven by the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS. 
Digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, contributing 0.5 points of our comparable sales growth. 
Looking at the components of our comparable sales. Comp transactions declined 2.2%, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average tickets. While ticket growth was broadly consistent with the last couple of years, traffic performance showed a meaningful change from prior trend. I want to pause and make it clear that we are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance, and as Brian described earlier, we are taking steps to grow both our traffic and sales over time. 
REDcard penetration was 23.9% in the first quarter, up about 180 basis points from last year. However, given that last year's pharmacy sales had a much lower-than-average REDcard penetration, the removal of those sales from this year's results drove a portion of the penetration improvement. Excluding net benefit, REDcard penetration was up about 70 basis points from a year ago. 
Moving down the P&L. Our second quarter EBITDA margin rate was 11.2%, up about 30 basis points from 10.9% a year ago. This improvement was entirely driven by a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A expense rate. 
Among the drivers of our gross margin rate, the pharmacy sales drove about 70 basis points of improvement from last year. This improvement was offset by pressure from shipping expense resulting from online growth, along with the impact of second quarter promotional and clearance markdowns, partially offset by the benefits of our cost control efforts. 
On the SG&A line, we saw pressure from investments in our team and in marketing along with the deleveraging impact of the decline in sales. These pressures were offset by the rate impact of the pharmacy sale combined with the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives. Overall, we saw a year-over-year increase in our SG&A expense rate of about 20 basis points. Given the pressures we were facing, this is really impressive expense performance, and I want to thank the team for their tireless efforts to control costs. 
Quarter-end inventory was up a little more than 4%, consistent with last quarter. Given the investments we've made in essential categories and assortment enhancements as well as the impact of the sales slow down that occurred in the second quarter, our quarter-end inventory position was relatively healthy. And of course, given our cost of sales outlook for the back half of the year, we will continue to monitor our receipts and inventory levels closely. 
Let's now turn to capital deployment. As we mentioned in our last conference call, this quarter, we deployed about $1 billion to settle a portion of our first quarter debt tenders -- tender offers, and we funded a $750 million debt maturity in July. In addition, during the quarter, we returned another $1.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends of $330 million and share repurchase of more than $1.3 billion. 
By the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, consistent with the guidance we provided in our first quarter conference call. 
One other note. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased approximately $8.8 billion of shares under the current -- company's current $10 billion repurchase authorization. As a result, we plan to request additional repurchase capacity from our board in the next several months. Given that our outlook anticipates continued cash available for share repurchase going forward. 
I want to reiterate that our priorities for capital deployment have not changed. First, we fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria; second, we support the dividend and intend to build on our 45-year record of annual dividend increases; and finally, we return cash by repurchasing shares when we have the capacity within the limits of our A credit -- long-term credit rating. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to govern the pace and magnitude of share repurchase in support of our goal to maintaining those credit ratings. Despite the challenging environment, our business continues to generate very strong returns. For the 12-month period through second quarter, we reported an after-tax return on invested capital of 15.8%, up from 13.3% a year ago. I'll quickly note, however, that this year's ROIC includes the onetime gain from the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS, which occurred last December. Without that onetime benefit, our second quarter after-tax ROIC was still a very healthy 13.7%, up about 40 basis points from last year. 
Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss the factors that are shaping our expectations going forward. Obviously, one consideration is the sales and traffic environment we've faced over the last several months, in which overall trends have been challenging, and weekly and regional patterns have been more variable than normal. 
The second consideration pertains to the relative benefit of planning our business conservatively. If actual sales turn out to be stronger than our expectations, our teams are prepared to chase inventory and ramp up hours in our stores and distribution centers. In those situations, we generally generate healthy profit rates on incremental sales. 
However, those same profit dynamics typically work in reverse when we miss our sales outlook, given that it's more difficult say cancel orders and to pull back on labor hours. So despite the fact that we continue to believe in our long-term strategy, and we're taking steps to address some of the company specific challenges Brian addressed earlier, we believe it's appropriate to temper our near-term sales and EPS expectations. 
So let's turn first to our outlook for the third quarter, beginning with sales. This quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales range of a minus 2% to flat, consistent with our second quarter guidance. If our comp sales are near the midpoint of that range, we expect to generate gross margin and SG&A expense rates similar to last year's level. This expectation reflects the continued benefit from the removal of the pharmacy sales from this year's results, offset by a continuation of the headwinds we faced in the second quarter. 
One note. The pharmacy sales is expected to cause a delta of a little more than 6 percentage points between comp sales and total sales this quarter, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we expect to deleverage depreciation and amortization line in the third quarter as the depreciation and amortization dollars are expected to be essentially flat to last year but spread over a smaller sales base. 
Altogether in the third quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.95. As we look beyond the third quarter, we are planning fourth quarter comp sales in the same range as third quarter. And given our third and fourth quarter profit outlook, combined with our year-to-date performance through the second quarter, we are planning to generate full year adjusted EPS of $4.80 to $5.20. We expect full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be about $0.44 lower than adjusted EPS as a result of the debt retirement and pharmacy transaction costs, which we recorded in the first half of the year. 
While this outlook for full year EPS is somewhat lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year, it reflects healthy profit performance in the face of challenging sales, and consistent with our performance through the first half of the year, it reflects the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives and disciplined management by our team. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to thank the team for making cost control a long-term habit, not a short-term focus. Last year, we announced a plan to save $2 billion over 2 years, and I'm pleased to say that we're not only running ahead of that goal, but the team continues to find new opportunities to eliminate unnecessary costs and activities. The savings allow us to reinvest resources in our enterprise priorities while still generating solid financial performance even in challenging times. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

So we certainly saw a slowdown in our pharmacy operations. We're working closely with CVS to launch some new marketing campaigns to win back our Target guests and certainly to begin to unlock the potential of their PBM network. So that's certainly played a role, but we also had other factors that we're focused on right now. We're not pleased with the performance we saw in Food despite making some really good progress in presentation, improving our assortment and certainly, the freshness to our products. So our #1 focus as we sit here today is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating visits to our site, and addressing the pharmacy impact is just one of the variables we're focused on today."

As we think about the rebalancing and the work that we're doing from a merchandising standpoint on in-store presentation standpoint and also a weekly advertising standpoint, we recognize we have to continue to deliver the right presentation for that stock and particularly in the back half of the month, have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right availability of the items our guest is looking for in that fill-in occasion. So we're activating and ensuring we put those changes in place to find a balance as we speak today. So we're certainly very focused and aware of the fact that we have to win on both fronts.

So we're very focused on that. From a CVS standpoint, I'll let John jump in here. It's not a surprise to us that there's been some disruption, and I think for all of us on the call, we know what it's like when we change a pharmacy prescription and move from one provider to another. And while they're staying in our location, they've got to sign up for some new programs. They're entering a new environment, there is some time that that's going to take, but we've been very pleased. John's been working with his CVS counterparts on the transition. We've had great collaboration, great partnership.

CVS would note that probably the best course they've ever seen in a transition like this and then starting to work with them to engage the pharmacy more back into the store through things like the opportunity here at Back-to-School, Back-to-College with flu shots and having the pharmacy play a more prominent role as we go forward.

The freshness and the work that John and his team have done from a supply chain standpoint is clearly connecting with the product we're delivering to the guests, and we've seen an uptick in categories like produce because we're delivering better product. But, at the same time, market by market, this is a very competitive space. There's clearly food deflation right now that we're facing, and it's a very competitive environment. And back to the earlier question about traffic and performance trends by market, we're looking very specifically at food by market across the country because we face a number of regional competitors and we better make sure our presentation, our promotion, our approach enables us to compete market by market."

So that's why we're spending time looking at LA25. It's why we've been testing a number of different features throughout our stores from Apparel to Home to Food. It's why we're so excited about investing in flex-formats, where we see a very strong response from the guest. Those are delivering very strong returns, well ahead of our original plan, and food plays an important part in those a smaller flex-formats. So despite what you may be hearing, we have absolutely complete support from the board to make sure we're investing capital behind the initiatives that are going to drive future growth. So again, we're not playing for just the short term. We're playing for the long term.

So there's no hesitancy at all in making those investments. And as you just said, Food and perishable and consumable categories will play a very important role in driving traffic to our stores and in the future, we've got to continue to bundle that with the work John's doing to make sure, and we're investing and improving our in-store pickup processes and experience. That's an investment we're making, an investment we're making for the holiday season. We're continuing to invest in our digital assets.

We got to make sure that Expect More categories like style, we continue to elevate, and we've got to make sure we deliver the Pay Less component and ensure that we balance the work that we're doing from a style standpoint with the progress we're making on those core household essentials, which include Food in that offering.

Our second quarter comparable sales decline of 1.1% was near the middle of our guidance range for the quarter but well below the results we expect to deliver over time. Against that backdrop, we reported much stronger-than-expected profitability. This outperformance was driven by our ongoing costs-saving efforts, which benefited both our gross margin and expense rates in the second quarter. These benefits helped to offset pressure from the current promotional environment, declining comp sales and the investments we're making in our team. I want to pause and thank our team for delivering this outstanding financial performance. 
At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are committed, first and foremost, to restoring positive comp sales growth in the quarters and years ahead. Based on the conversations with many of you, we know there's a great deal of focus on the broad macro challenges facing retailers, including a consumer focused on experiences, the impact of price deflation and a channel shift into digital. These are real challenges, but they are not new to our business. With the right strategy and strong execution, we've demonstrated our ability to perform in the face of those challenges, and our expectation is that we will continue to be a top retail performer over time. 
In the second quarter, our #1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories, and consistent with the first quarter, we saw higher-than-normal variability in sales patterns. Despite these challenges, we're encouraged that we saw the strongest sales performance around key second quarter events, including Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and the beginning of the Back-to-School season. 
As we analyze the drivers of our second quarter performance, we've identified some company-specific challenges we are actively addressing. This includes meaningful pressure in Electronics, where we saw a double-digit decline in comp sales this quarter, accounting for approximately 70 basis points of overall comp decline. Notably, about 1/3 of this pressure was driven by Apple products, which were down more than 20% in the quarter. We're focused on reversing these trends, and we're collaborating with Apple and other vendor partners to evolve our assortment and accelerate innovation to deliver stronger sales. 
In Grocery, despite improvements in assortments, quality, freshness, presentation and in-stock, we were disappointed with our sales performance as we saw a small comp sales decline in the second quarter. While our Grocery business was negatively impacted by Food deflation, which accounted for about 20 basis points of pressure, we clearly have more work to do to unlock the growth potential in this important category. Given our recent performance and the increasingly competitive Food environment, we're revisiting our second half Grocery efforts, from presentation to assortment to promotion, to improve our competitive position. And as I will discuss in a few minutes, we'll be leveraging the learning from our LA25 remodels to help guide our plans going forward. Beyond Food, we are rebalancing our messaging and promotion to ensure we continue to drive strong performance in Style categories and reach consumers who are intently focused on value in this environment. 
Finally, we experienced soft second quarter traffic trends in the pharmacies in our stores as we completed the rebranding transition from Target to CVS across the country. The execution of the transition went very smoothly, and we've been very pleased with the level of collaboration between our teams and our partners at CVS. While it's not surprising that the rebranding activity has resulted in some near-term disruption, we're focused on restoring growth in this traffic-driving area in our stores. 
As a result, we're working closely with our partners at CVS as they launch media, marketing and member engagement campaigns to increase awareness and utilization of CVS pharmacies in our stores. In addition, CVS is executing an in-store engagement campaign and plans to offer special flu shot incentives at the pharmacies in our stores. As we take steps to increase awareness of the CVS-Target partnership, both among our guests and members of the CVS PBM business, we expect to reaccelerate pharmacy traffic in our stores over time. 
Despite this quarter's challenges, we're pleased that the fundamental elements of our strategy are continuing to shape our results. Comparable sales in signature categories continue to lead the company, reflecting investments we've made in quality, presentation and marketing. In the second quarter, comp sales growth in these categories outpaced the company by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Within signature, we saw particular strength in both Kids and Style. Results in Kids reflected the launch of Cat & Jack, which is now positioned to become our biggest own brand. After the July rollout of this brand, we saw double-digit growth in Cat & Jack sales when measured against comparable sales of Circo and Cherokee last year. 
Within Style, we continue to benefit from strength in women's Apparel. We saw a mid-single-digit comp increase in the quarter. This performance was dribbled -- driven by double-digit growth in our Xhilaration brand, which is focused on a younger style-savvy guest. In addition, we're really pleased with the performance of Who What Wear, which is one of the most productive brands on our women's floor plan [ph]. As a result, we're expanding the range of this assortment for the fall, inviting more of our guests to enjoy the items from this fashion-forward collaboration. 
Digital sales grew more than 16% in the second quarter on top of 30% growth last year. We continue to invest in Target's digital assets to enhance the guest experience and drive sales in all channels, and our results demonstrate the impact of the investments we've made over time. For example, several years ago, we told you we had an opportunity to improve our digital conversion. Since then, we've invested to improve our conversion performance by streamlining online checkouts, making the site more appealing and easy to use, enhancing our personalization capabilities and improving search. 
As a result, for several years in a row, we've seen meaningful improvement in our digital conversion across all platforms, particularly in mobile. In the second quarter, we launched a brand-new fully adaptive site, which means we now provide a seamless experience across all platforms, from desktop to tablets to smartphones. This is increasingly important because, for many guests, a single purchase journey crosses over 2 or more of these digital devices. 
We're really pleased with the results in our new flexible-format stores, which are designed for very dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. These stores allow us to operate in areas we've never been able to serve with our largest-format stores, allowing us to extend our reach to consumers with high affinity for our brand. In July, we opened up new flex-format stores in Washington Square in Philadelphia, Lincoln Park in Chicago, Commonwealth in Boston and Forest Hills in Queens. We're excited to be serving guests in these iconic neighborhoods, and the guest response to these new locations has been fantastic. 
Financially, flexible formats are very successful. The sales productivity is much higher than our company average, and they've been meeting or exceeding our profit targets. In total this year, we're planning to open 14 flex-format stores, including a multilevel location in TriBeCa this October. Based on our experience to date and our investments and capabilities, we're increasingly confident in our ability to successfully open and operate stores in a variety of neighborhood settings across the country. As a result, we're accelerating our pipeline of locations we can open in future years, and we expect flex-format stores to be a key driver of future growth. 
In our existing stores, we continue to invest in presentation and experience, particularly in signature categories. We completed the remodeling of our LA25 test stores in the second quarter, and we're in the early stages of a robust learning plan to measure guest reaction to the changes we've made. Overall, we're encouraged by initial results in these stores, and we're already rolling out some of the innovations from these stores more broadly. Namely, we're pleased with the presentation innovation in home and Apparel and results from our work to elevate the order pickup experience. So we're already extending these innovations beyond the LA market. 
In addition, the changes we've made to the Food area in the LA25 test stores has really resonated with guests. Grocery sales in these stores are trending 2 to 3 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Relative performance in produce is even stronger, driving perishable comps that are more than 5 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. 
Guests have told us the new Food area now feels more intimate and separate from the rest of the store, providing a distinct Grocery shopping experience they prefer. We're very encouraged with these initial observations, and we'll continue to leverage learning from these stores as we work to improve Grocery performance across the chain. 
We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates a lot of cash even in challenging times. This cash allows us to make long-term investments in our business while returning cash to our shareholders at the same time. In June, we announced that our board had approved a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend, supporting our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. In addition, our cash position allowed us to return well over $1 billion through share repurchase in the second quarter in support of our goal to return $3.5 billion or more this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very excited about the Back-to-School and Back-to-College season, which is second only to the fourth quarter holiday season in terms of importance. In Back-to-School, we continue to work with kids and parents to inform our product design and development process. So it's only natural that this year, we engaged with kids to design and execute our Back-to-School marketing campaign. Kids led all aspects of this campaign: drafting storyboards, illustrating creative content, directing the spots and performing the music. 
To make shopping fast and convenient for busy families, this year, we partnered with teacherlists.com to make nearly 1 million school supply lists available with our School List Assist tool on target.com. This tool allows parents to quickly and seamlessly purchase supplies off their kids' class lists, arrange for Store Pickup or have the items delivered directly to their home. 
In Back-to-College, our marketing campaign is designed around today's students which are digital mavens. In this campaign, we're partnering with 3 recent graduates to create inspiring, do-it-yourself videos to help college students make their new dorm room or apartment feel like home. In addition, we provided tools to make college shopping convenient and fun, including college registry, order pickup, subscriptions and special offers on Cartwheel. As we've done for more than 15 years, we're hosting Back-to-College after-hour shopping event, which will take place at 85 colleges and universities in the next couple of months. In these events, we provide free bus transportation from campus and provide students the opportunity to stock up and save on everything they'll need for school. 
I want to pause here and mention how happy we are to have Mark Tritton on the Target team. Mark took on the role of Chief Merchandising Officer in the second quarter, and he spent the last couple of months getting to know his team and becoming immersed in our business. Mark is creative and passionate about retail. He's had an amazing career building iconic brands, and I'm confident he'll be able to grow both our own brands and our Target brand. Mark is planning to speak on this conference call next quarter, when he'll outline our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
We continue to believe we're focused on the right strategic priorities, and we're confident in our ability to grow profitably over time. We believe it's appropriate to update our sales and EPS outlook for the remainder of the year. Our decision is informed by the retail sales environment and the variability we continue to see in our weekly and regional results. While we are laser-focused on accelerating traffic and sales, it's prudent to build near-term business and inventory plans that are consistent with recent trends. As always, we'll be prepared to flex those plans upward if results begin to recover in the second half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to spend a second with a special thank you to our team and our stores. I visit our stores around the country nearly every week, and I'm so grateful to have a group of such smart and friendly team members serving our guests. John's team at headquarters is focused on ways to simplify our processes, modernize our supply chain and help ensure our stores feature the right assortment of items that are in stock every day. When we back up an outstanding team with the right business fundamentals, we offer an unparalleled experience in retail. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who'll provide more details on his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It's long been a key point of differentiation for our brand. What I didn't fully appreciate until I came into my new role as COO was the workload that our supply chain processes have been driving into our stores. Historically, when we design processes to improve upstream efficiencies in our supply chain, we often achieve those benefits by moving work and complexity into our stores. 
One of the key priorities of my new team has been to look at the entire supply chain and find ways to optimize it end to end to deliver reliability for our guests while driving efficiency for the organization as a whole. A key measure of reliability is our ability to stay in stock, and I'm pleased that we continue to see improvement even as we begin to compare against improvements from a year ago. In stores, as we entered the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons, Target's overall out-of-stock position was better than we have ever measured historically. In addition, out-of-stocks on frequency and commodity items, the items in which reliability is most important for our guests, are in an even stronger position. And in the digital channel, while we have much work yet to do, we have already reduced out-of-stocks by more than 50% in the last 6 months. 
Our work to reduce variability in our distribution centers has been one of the drivers of these improvements. In the past, an unacceptable number of vendor shipments were received by our DCs either too early or too late. This variability drove a lot of extra workload in the DCs while reducing our reliability downstream. As a result, this year, we have been collaborating with our vendors to increase the percent of shipments that arrive on the correct date, and we've already seen meaningful progress. The percent of shipments that arrive on time has more than doubled, and we expect to see additional improvement as we roll out new processes to additional vendors over time. 
As shipments arrive at our distribution centers, we've made changes to the prioritization of inbound processing, which have already cut the time to unload trailers by more than 50%, and we believe we can cut that time even further. In addition, we've improved process flow between our import warehouses and our regional DCs, reducing the average time it takes for an item in an import warehouse to reach the store shelves by more than half. 
We're also focused on our outbound processing, with a goal of enabling daily deliveries to every store throughout the week regardless of a store's sales volume. When implemented, this change will drive additional improvements to store in-stocks while reducing backroom inventory and store workload. I want to thank the entire team, from merchandise planning to our distribution centers, logistics teams and our stores, for these improvements. Without the engagement of the entire end-to-end supply chain, we couldn't have made such amazing progress. 
Before I move on to our work in the stores, I want to comment briefly on our overall inventory position. As we've mentioned over the last several quarters, a portion of our year-over-year inventory growth reflects intentional investments we're making in nonseasonal commodity categories to support in-stock improvement on items most important to our guests. In addition, our second quarter inventory reflected an investment to offer additional items in certain categories as we work with merchant teams to reliably offer appropriate assortment, both online and in our stores, to best serve our guests. 
Beyond our upstream supply chain work, our investment in self-checkout lanes is also reducing store workload, freeing up time for our store teams to focus on guest service while providing our guests a checkout option that many of them prefer. As of today, we have self-checkout in just over 1,000 of our stores. We're planning to add it to another 200 stores by the end of the year, and we will continue the rollout through 2017. 
In stores with self-checkout, nearly 1/3 of transactions go through these lanes, much higher than our initial projections. 
Our flexible fulfillment initiatives, including Store Pickup and ship-from-store, are one way we're reinvesting store labor savings to serve guests in new ways. At the end of 2015, more than 460 stores were shipping items directly to guest homes, and we're planning to double our capacity this year by expanding this capability to more than 500 additional stores. These additional locations will further improve our average ship time while providing deeper access to our store inventories, increasing the likelihood that we can ship a guest's entire order from a single nearby store location. And importantly, because we are now prepositioning high-velocity, web-only items in the back room of ship-from-store locations, we are able to reduce last mile and split shipment expenses dramatically. 
In-store pickup is an increasingly popular option for many of our guests. This year, we've seen 50% growth in pickup orders on top of 60% growth a year ago. Year-to-date, more than 90% of our pickup orders have been ready in 1 hour, and we've implemented process improvements to reduce wait times in stores. As a result, guest satisfaction with the pickup experience is up from a year ago, and a higher percent of guests are repeatedly using this service. 
To prepare for this holiday season's surge, we're investing to ensure our stores can continue to deliver a great pickup experience in the face of rapidly increasing demand. In 75 of our highest volume stores, we're increasing holding capacity to allow our team to retrieve items more quickly even during peak times. We're also investing in additional digital devices to support peak demand, and across all of our stores, we're rolling out new guidance on how our stores can optimize their storage space to enhance speed and efficiency. 
New this year, we've implemented systems and processes to allow stores to forecast and monitor pickup demand, ensuring we maintain proper staffing levels. In addition, during the holiday season, about 300 stores will be testing separate branded shirts for the team members in the pickup area and distinctive bags for pickup orders to underscore our commitment to this experience. 
Finally, as Brian mentioned, Back-to-School, Back-to-College season is our second most important sales driver of the year. As a result, we're planning to carefully measure our pickup reliability and speed during promotional peaks this quarter so we can apply those learnings in time for the holiday season when peak demand will be even higher. 
It was just a year ago that I began working with my new team, and I'm very proud of what we've accomplished since then. However, I'm also energized by the opportunities still ahead of us to further increase the speed, flexibility and reliability of our supply chain, to drive unnecessary workload out of our stores and to enable operational excellence across the organization. As we work to accomplish these goals, I'm fortunate to work with an experienced team, led by both internal talent and some amazing new hires, and I'm confident that with their leadership, we will continue to improve Target's operations on behalf of our guests. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"
174438,344500266,1036398,"Target Corp., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, d",1500,"Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.17 of debt retirement costs due to settlement timing on a subset of our first quarter debt tender offers. 
This quarter's profit performance was quite impressive in light of the challenging sales environment. Specifically, comparable sales declined 1.1% this quarter, in line with our guidance and well below our plan at the beginning of the year. As expected, the total sales in the second quarter were down more than 7% from last year, driven by the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS. Digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, contributing 0.5 point of our comparable sales growth. 
Looking at the components of our comparable sales. Comp transactions declined 2.2%, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average ticket. While ticket growth was broadly consistent with the last couple of years, traffic performance showed a meaningful change from prior trend. I want to pause and make it clear that we are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance, and as Brian described earlier, we are taking steps to grow both our traffic and sales over time. 
REDcard penetration was 23.9% in the first quarter, up about 180 basis points from last year. However, given that last year's pharmacy sales had a much lower-than-average REDcard penetration, the removal of those sales from this year's results drove a portion of the penetration improvement. Excluding net benefit, REDcard penetration was up about 70 basis points from a year ago. 
Moving down the P&L. Our second quarter EBITDA margin rate was 11.2%, up about 30 basis points from 10.9% a year ago. This improvement was entirely driven by a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A expense rate. Among the drivers of our gross margin rate, the pharmacy sales drove about 70 basis points of improvement from last year. This improvement was offset by pressure from shipping expense resulting from online growth, along with the impact of second quarter promotional and clearance markdowns, partially offset by the benefit of our cost-control efforts. 
On the SG&A line, we saw pressure from investments in our team and in marketing, along with the deleveraging impact of the decline in sales. These pressures were offset by the rate impact of the pharmacy sale combined with the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives. Overall, we saw a year-over-year increase in our SG&A expense rate of about 20 basis points. Given the pressures we were facing, this is really impressive expense performance, and I want to thank the team for their tireless efforts to control costs. 
Quarter-end inventory was up a little more than 4%, consistent with last quarter. Given the investments we've made in essential categories and assortment enhancements as well as the impact of the sales slowdown that occurred in the second quarter, our quarter-end inventory position was relatively healthy. And of course, given our cost of sales outlook for the back half of the year, we will continue to monitor our receipts and inventory levels closely. 
Let's now turn to capital deployment. As we mentioned in our last conference call, this quarter, we deployed about $1 billion to settle a portion of our first quarter debt tenders -- tender offers, and we funded a $750 million debt maturity in July. In addition, during the quarter, we returned another $1.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends of $330 million and share repurchase of more than $1.3 billion. By the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, consistent with the guidance we provided in our first quarter conference call. 
One other note. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased approximately $8.8 billion of shares under the current -- company's current $10 billion repurchase authorization. As a result, we plan to request additional repurchase capacity from our board in the next several months given that our outlook anticipates continued cash available for share repurchase going forward. 
I want to reiterate that our priorities for capital deployment have not changed. First, we fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and intend to build on our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we return cash to -- by repurchasing shares when we have the capacity within the limits of our A credit -- long-term credit rating. Looking ahead, we will continue to govern the pace and magnitude of share repurchase in support of our goal to maintaining those credit ratings. 
Despite the challenging environment, our business continues to generate very strong returns. For the 12-month period through second quarter, we reported an after-tax return on invested capital of 15.8%, up from 13.3% a year ago. I'll quickly note, however, that this year's ROIC includes the onetime gain from the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS, which occurred last December. Without that onetime benefit, our second quarter after-tax ROIC was still a very healthy 13.7%, up about 40 basis points from last year. 
Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss the factors that are shaping our expectations going forward. Obviously, one consideration is the sales and traffic environment we've faced over the last several months, in which overall trends have been challenging and weekly and regional patterns have been more variable than normal. The second consideration pertains to the relative benefit of planning our business conservatively. If actual sales turn out to be stronger than our expectations, our teams are prepared to chase inventory and ramp up hours in our stores and distribution centers. In those situations, we generally generate healthy profit rates on incremental sales. However, those same profit dynamics typically work in reverse when we miss our sales outlook given that it's more difficult to cancel orders and to pull back on labor hours. So despite the fact that we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and we're taking steps to address some of the company-specific challenges Brian addressed earlier, we believe it's appropriate to temper our near-term sales and EPS expectations. 
So let's turn first to our outlook for the third quarter, beginning with sales. This quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales range of a minus 2% to flat, consistent with our second quarter guidance. If our comp sales are near the midpoint of that range, we expect to generate gross margin and SG&A expense rates similar to last year's level. This expectation reflects the continued benefit from the removal of the pharmacy sales from this year's results, offset by a continuation of the headwinds we faced in the second quarter. 
One note. The pharmacy sales is expected to cause a delta of a little more than 6 percentage points between comp sales and total sales this quarter, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we expect to deleverage depreciation and amortization line in the third quarter as the depreciation and amortization dollars are expected to be essentially flat to last year but spread over a smaller sales base. 
Altogether, in the third quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.95. As we look beyond the third quarter, we are planning fourth quarter comp sales in the same range as third quarter. And given our third and fourth quarter profit outlook, combined with our year-to-date performance through the second quarter, we're planning to generate full year adjusted EPS of $4.80 to $5.20. We expect full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be about $0.44 lower than adjusted EPS as a result of the debt retirement and pharmacy transaction costs, which we recorded in the first half of the year. While this outlook for full year EPS is somewhat lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year, it reflects healthy profit performance in the face of challenging sales, and consistent with our performance through the first half of the year, it reflects the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives and disciplined management by our team. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to thank the team for making cost control a long-term habit not a short-term focus. Last year, we announced a plan to save $2 billion over 2 years, and I'm pleased to say that we're not only running ahead of that goal, but the team continues to find new opportunities to eliminate unnecessary costs and activities. These savings allow us to reinvest resources in our enterprise priorities while still generating solid financial performance even in challenging times. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

So Oliver, as we think about the second half, we've got to continue to build on the things that are working today. Even in a challenging second quarter, we grew market share in the important Apparel space. We saw very strong results in our home categories. We continue to be a destination for toys. So we've got to build on the things that are working and ensure that we're also winning trips for those core household essentials. So we'll be focusing on rebalancing, on leveraging the improvements we've made, both in store with our in-store pickup process and also online. And we're not altering our strategic focus. It's making sure we get our strategies in balance and we deliver against both signature categories and those important household essentials that drive traffic to our stores and put cars in the parking lot."

Who What Where continues to be a real winner for us in connecting well with our guests, and we've also matched that up with an improved in-store experience. We've been talking about mannequins for a while, but the role that our visual merchandisers are playing, the investment that John and I made last year to ensure we had not only mannequins and home vignettes but the talent in our stores to maintain that experience 52 weeks a year is certainly connecting with the guest. So we think we're benefiting by really executing against the strategy we've been talking about for several years, making sure we have the right quality, innovation, presentation in our stores and we surround our guests with great service.

It's why we're so excited about investing in flex formats, where we see a very strong response from the guest. Those are delivering very strong returns, well ahead of our original plan, and Food plays an important part in those smaller flex-formats. So despite what you may be hearing, we have absolutely complete support from the board to make sure we're investing capital behind the initiatives that are going to drive future growth.

Our second quarter comparable sales decline of 1.1% was near the middle of our guidance range for the quarter but well below the results we expect to deliver over time. Against that backdrop, we reported much stronger-than-expected profitability. This outperformance was driven by our ongoing cost-saving efforts, which benefited both our gross margin and expense rates in the second quarter. These benefits helped to offset pressure from the current promotional environment, declining comp sales and the investments we're making in our team. I want to pause and thank our team for delivering this outstanding financial performance. 
At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are committed, first and foremost, to restoring positive comp sales growth in the quarters and years ahead. Based on the conversations with many of you, we know there's a great deal of focus on the broad macro challenges facing retailers, including a consumer focused on experiences, the impact of price deflation and a channel shift into digital. These are real challenges, but they are not new to our business. With the right strategy and strong execution, we've demonstrated our ability to perform in the face of those challenges, and our expectation is that we will continue to be a top retail performer over time. 
In the second quarter, our #1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories, and consistent with the first quarter, we saw higher-than-normal variability in sales patterns. Despite these challenges, we're encouraged that we saw the strongest sales performance around key second quarter events, including Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and the beginning of the Back-to-School season. 
As we analyze the drivers of our second quarter performance, we've identified some company-specific challenges we are actively addressing. This includes meaningful pressure in Electronics, where we saw a double-digit decline in comp sales this quarter, accounting for approximately 70 basis points of overall comp decline. Notably, about 1/3 of this pressure was driven by Apple products, which were down more than 20% in the quarter. We're focused on reversing these trends, and we're collaborating with Apple and other vendor partners to evolve our assortment and accelerate innovation to deliver stronger sales. 
In Grocery, despite improvements in assortments, quality, freshness, presentation and in-stock, we were disappointed with our sales performance as we saw a small comp sales decline in the second quarter. While our Grocery business was negatively impacted by Food deflation, which accounted for about 20 basis points of pressure, we clearly have more work to do to unlock the growth potential in this important category. Given our recent performance and the increasingly competitive Food environment, we're revisiting our second half Grocery efforts, from presentation to assortment to promotion, to improve our competitive position. And as I will discuss in a few minutes, we'll be leveraging the learning from our LA25 remodels to help guide our plans going forward. Beyond Food, we are rebalancing our messaging and promotions to ensure we continue to drive strong performance in Style categories and reach consumers who are intently focused on value in this environment. 
Finally, we experienced soft second quarter traffic trends in the pharmacies in our stores as we completed the rebranding transition from Target to CVS across the country. The execution of the transition went very smoothly, and we've been very pleased with the level of collaboration between our teams and our partners at CVS. While it's not surprising that the rebranding activity has resulted in some near-term disruption, we're focused on restoring growth in this traffic-driving area in our stores. 
As a result, we're working closely with our partners at CVS as they launch media, marketing and member engagement campaigns to increase awareness and utilization of CVS pharmacies in our stores. In addition, CVS is executing an in-store engagement campaign and plans to offer special flu shot incentives at the pharmacies in our stores. As we take steps to increase awareness of the CVS-Target partnership, both among our guests and members of the CVS PBM business, we expect to reaccelerate pharmacy traffic in our stores over time. 
Despite this quarter's challenges, we're pleased that the fundamental elements of our strategy are continuing to shape our results. Comparable sales in signature categories continue to lead the company, reflecting investments we've made in quality, presentation and marketing. In the second quarter, comp sales growth in these categories outpaced the company by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Within signature, we saw particular strength in both Kids and Style. Results in Kids reflected the launch of Cat & Jack, which is now positioned to become our biggest own brand. After the July rollout of this brand, we saw double-digit growth in Cat & Jack sales when measured against comparable sales of Circo and Cherokee last year. 
Within Style, we continue to benefit from strength in women's Apparel. We saw a mid-single-digit comp increase in the quarter. This performance was dribbled -- driven by double-digit growth in our Xhilaration brand, which is focused on a younger style-savvy guest. In addition, we're really pleased with the performance of Who What Wear, which is one of the most productive brands on our women's floor pad. As a result, we're expanding the range of this assortment for the fall, inviting more of our guests to enjoy the items from this fashion-forward collaboration. 
Digital sales grew more than 16% in the second quarter on top of 30% growth last year. We continue to invest in Target's digital assets to enhance the guest experience and drive sales in all channels, and our results demonstrate the impact of the investments we've made over time. For example, several years ago, we told you we had an opportunity to improve our digital conversion. Since then, we've invested to improve our conversion performance by streamlining online checkout, making the site more appealing and easy to use, enhancing our personalization capabilities and improving search. 
As a result, for several years in a row, we've seen meaningful improvement in our digital conversion across all platforms, particularly in mobile. In the second quarter, we launched a brand-new fully adaptive site, which means we now provide a seamless experience across all platforms, from desktop to tablets to smartphones. This is increasingly important because, for many guests, a single purchase journey crosses over 2 or more of these digital devices. 
We're really pleased with the results in our new flexible-format stores, which are designed for very dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. These stores allow us to operate in areas we've never been able to serve with our largest-format stores, allowing us to extend our reach to consumers with high affinity for our brand. In July, we opened up new flex-format stores in Washington Square in Philadelphia, Lincoln Park in Chicago, Commonwealth in Boston and Forest Hills in Queens. We're excited to be serving guests in these iconic neighborhoods, and the guest response to these new locations has been fantastic. 
Financially, flexible formats are very successful. The sales productivity is much higher than our company average, and they've been meeting or exceeding our profit targets. In total this year, we're planning to open 14 flex-format stores, including a multilevel location in TriBeCa this October. Based on our experience to date and our investments in capabilities, we're increasingly confident in our ability to successfully open and operate stores in a variety of neighborhood settings across the country. As a result, we're accelerating our pipeline of locations we can open in future years, and we expect flex-format stores to be a key driver of future growth. 
In our existing stores, we continue to invest in presentation and experience, particularly in signature categories. We completed the remodeling of our LA25 test stores in the second quarter, and we're in the early stages of a robust learning plan to measure guest reaction to the changes we've made. Overall, we're encouraged by initial results in these stores, and we're already rolling out some of the innovation from these stores more broadly. Namely, we're pleased with the presentation innovation in Home and Apparel and results from our work to elevate the order pickup experience. So we're already extending these innovations beyond the LA market. 
In addition, the changes we've made to the Food area in the LA25 test stores has really resonated with guests. Grocery sales in these stores are trending 2 to 3 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Relative performance in produce is even stronger, driving perishable comps that are more than 5 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. 
Guests have told us the new Food area now feels more intimate and separate from the rest of the store, providing a distinct Grocery shopping experience they prefer. We're very encouraged with these initial observations, and we'll continue to leverage learning from these stores as we work to improve Grocery performance across the chain. 
We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates a lot of cash even in challenging times. This cash allows us to make long-term investments in our business while returning cash to our shareholders at the same time. In June, we announced that our board had approved a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend, supporting our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. In addition, our cash position allowed us to return well over $1 billion through share repurchase in the second quarter in support of our goal to return $3.5 billion or more this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very excited about the Back-to-School and Back-to-College season, which is second only to the fourth quarter holiday season in terms of importance. In Back-to-School, we continue to work with kids and parents to inform our product design and development process. So it's only natural that this year, we engaged with kids to design and execute our Back-to-School marketing campaign. Kids led all aspects of this campaign: drafting storyboards, illustrating creative content, directing the spots and performing the music. 
To make shopping fast and convenient for busy families, this year, we partnered with teacherlists.com to make nearly 1 million school supply lists available with our School List Assist tool on target.com. This tool allows parents to quickly and seamlessly purchase supplies off their kids' class lists, arrange for Store Pickup or have the items delivered directly to their home. 
In Back-to-College, our marketing campaign is designed around today's students which are digital natives. In this campaign, we're partnering with 3 recent graduates to create inspiring, do-it-yourself videos to help college students make their new dorm room or apartment feel like home. In addition, we provided tools to make college shopping convenient and fun, including college registry, order pickup, subscriptions and special offers on Cartwheel. As we've done for more than 15 years, we're hosting Back-to-College after-hour shopping events, which will take place at 85 colleges and universities in the next couple of months. In these events, we provide free bus transportation from campus and provide students the opportunity to stock up and save on everything they'll need for school. 
I want to pause here and mention how happy we are to have Mark Tritton on the Target team. Mark took on the role of Chief Merchandising Officer in the second quarter, and he's spent the last couple of months getting to know his team and becoming immersed in our business. Mark is creative and passionate about retail. He's had an amazing career building iconic brands, and I'm confident he'll be able to grow both our own brands and our Target brand. Mark is planning to speak on this conference call next quarter, when he'll outline our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
We continue to believe we're focused on the right strategic priorities, and we're confident in our ability to grow profitably over time. We believe it's appropriate to update our sales and EPS outlook for the remainder of the year. Our decision is informed by the retail sales environment and the variability we continue to see in our weekly and regional results. While we are laser-focused on accelerating traffic and sales, it's prudent to build near-term business and inventory plans that are consistent with recent trends. As always, we'll be prepared to flex those plans upward if results begin to recover in the second half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to spend a second with a special thank you to our team and our stores. I visit our stores around the country nearly every week, and I'm so grateful to have a group of such smart and friendly team members serving our guests. John's team at headquarters is focused on ways to simplify our processes, modernize our supply chain and help ensure our stores feature the right assortment of items that are in stock every day. When we back up an outstanding team with the right business fundamentals, we offer an unparalleled experience in retail. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who'll provide more details on his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It's long been a key point of differentiation for our brand. What I didn't fully appreciate until I came into my new role as COO was the workload that our supply chain processes have been driving into our stores. Historically, when we design processes to improve upstream efficiencies in our supply chain, we often achieve those benefits by moving work and complexity into our stores. 
One of the key priorities of my new team has been to look at the entire supply chain and find ways to optimize it end to end to deliver reliability for our guests while driving efficiency for the organization as a whole. A key measure of reliability is our ability to stay in stock, and I'm pleased that we continue to see improvement even as we begin to compare against improvements from a year ago. In stores, as we entered the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons, Target's overall out-of-stock position was better than we have ever measured historically. In addition, out-of-stocks on frequency and commodity items, the items for which reliability is most important for our guests, are in an even stronger position. And in the digital channel, while we have much work yet to do, we have already reduced out-of-stocks by more than 50% in the last 6 months. 
Our work to reduce variability in our distribution centers has been one of the drivers of these improvements. In the past, an unacceptable number of vendor shipments were received by our DCs either too early or too late. This variability drove a lot of extra workload in the DCs while reducing our reliability downstream. As a result, this year, we have been collaborating with our vendors to increase the percent of shipments that arrive on the correct day, and we've already seen meaningful progress. The percent of shipments that arrive on time has more than doubled, and we expect to see additional improvement as we roll out new processes to additional vendors over time. 
As shipments arrive at our distribution centers, we've made changes to the prioritization of inbound processing, which have already cut the time to unload trailers by more than 50%, and we believe we can cut that time even further. In addition, we've improved process flow between our import warehouses and our regional DCs, reducing the average time it takes for an item in an import warehouse to reach the store shelves by more than half. 
We're also focused on our outbound processing, with a goal of enabling daily deliveries to every store throughout the week regardless of a store's sales volume. When implemented, this change will drive additional improvements to store in-stocks while reducing backroom inventory and store workload. I want to thank the entire team, from merchandise planning to our distribution centers, logistics teams and our stores, for these improvements. Without the engagement of the entire end-to-end supply chain, we couldn't have made such amazing progress. 
Before I move on to our work in the stores, I want to comment briefly on our overall inventory position. As we've mentioned over the last several quarters, a portion of our year-over-year inventory growth reflects intentional investments we're making in nonseasonal commodity categories to support in-stock improvement on items most important to our guests. In addition, our second quarter inventory reflected an investment to offer additional items in certain categories as we work with merchant teams to reliably offer appropriate assortment, both online and in our stores, to best serve our guests. 
Beyond our upstream supply chain work, our investment in self-checkout lanes is also reducing store workload, freeing up time for our store teams to focus on guest service while providing our guests a checkout option that many of them prefer. As of today, we have self-checkout in just over 1,000 of our stores. We're planning to add it to another 200 stores by the end of the year, and we will continue the rollout through 2017. In stores with self-checkout, nearly 1/3 of transactions go through these lanes, much higher than our initial projections. 
Our flexible fulfillment initiatives, including Store Pickup and ship-from-store, are one way we're reinvesting store labor savings to serve guests in new ways. At the end of 2015, more than 460 stores were shipping items directly to guest homes, and we're planning to double our capacity this year by expanding this capability to more than 500 additional stores. These additional locations will further improve our average ship time while providing deeper access to our store inventories, increasing the likelihood that we can ship a guest's entire order from a single nearby store location. And importantly, because we are now prepositioning high-velocity, web-only items in the back room of ship-from-store locations, we are able to reduce last mile and split shipment expenses dramatically. 
In-store pickup is an increasingly popular option for many of our guests. This year, we've seen 50% growth in pickup orders on top of 60% growth a year ago. Year-to-date, more than 90% of our pickup orders have been ready in 1 hour, and we've implemented process improvements to reduce wait times in stores. As a result, guest satisfaction with the pickup experience is up from a year ago, and a higher percent of guests are repeatedly using this service. 
To prepare for this holiday season's surge, we're investing to ensure our stores can continue to deliver a great pickup experience in the face of rapidly increasing demand. In 75 of our highest volume stores, we're increasing holding capacity to allow our team to retrieve items more quickly even during peak times. We're also investing in additional digital devices to support peak demand, and across all of our stores, we're rolling out new guidance on how our stores can optimize their storage space to enhance speed and efficiency. 
New this year, we've implemented systems and processes to allow stores to forecast and monitor pickup demand, ensuring we maintain proper staffing levels. In addition, during the holiday season, about 300 stores will be testing separate branded shirts for the team members in the pickup area and distinctive bags for pickup orders to underscore our commitment to this experience. 
Finally, as Brian mentioned, Back-to-School, Back-to-College season is our second most important sales driver of the year. As a result, we're planning to carefully measure our pickup reliability and speed during promotional peaks this quarter so we can apply those learnings in time for the holiday season when peak demand will be even higher. 
It was just a year ago that I began working with my new team, and I'm very proud of what we've accomplished since then. However, I'm also energized by the opportunities still ahead of us to further increase the speed, flexibility and reliability of our supply chain, to drive unnecessary workload out of our stores and to enable operational excellence across the organization. As we work to accomplish these goals, I'm fortunate to work with an experienced team, led by both internal talent and some amazing new hires, and I'm confident that with their leadership, we will continue to improve Target's operations on behalf of our guests. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"
174438,344500266,1036461,"Target Corp., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, d",1500,"Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.17 of debt retirement costs due to settlement timing on a subset of our first quarter debt tender offers. 
This quarter's profit performance was quite impressive in light of the challenging sales environment. Specifically, comparable sales declined 1.1% this quarter, in line with our guidance and well below our plan at the beginning of the year. As expected, the total sales in the second quarter were down more than 7% from last year, driven by the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS. Digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, contributing 0.5 point of our comparable sales growth. 
Looking at the components of our comparable sales. Comp transactions declined 2.2%, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average ticket. While ticket growth was broadly consistent with the last couple of years, traffic performance showed a meaningful change from prior trend. I want to pause and make it clear that we are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance, and as Brian described earlier, we are taking steps to grow both our traffic and sales over time. 
REDcard penetration was 23.9% in the first quarter, up about 180 basis points from last year. However, given that last year's pharmacy sales had a much lower-than-average REDcard penetration, the removal of those sales from this year's results drove a portion of the penetration improvement. Excluding net benefit, REDcard penetration was up about 70 basis points from a year ago. 
Moving down the P&L. Our second quarter EBITDA margin rate was 11.2%, up about 30 basis points from 10.9% a year ago. This improvement was entirely driven by a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A expense rate. Among the drivers of our gross margin rate, the pharmacy sales drove about 70 basis points of improvement from last year. This improvement was offset by pressure from shipping expense resulting from online growth, along with the impact of second quarter promotional and clearance markdowns, partially offset by the benefit of our cost-control efforts. 
On the SG&A line, we saw pressure from investments in our team and in marketing, along with the deleveraging impact of the decline in sales. These pressures were offset by the rate impact of the pharmacy sale combined with the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives. Overall, we saw a year-over-year increase in our SG&A expense rate of about 20 basis points. Given the pressures we were facing, this is really impressive expense performance, and I want to thank the team for their tireless efforts to control costs. 
Quarter-end inventory was up a little more than 4%, consistent with last quarter. Given the investments we've made in essential categories and assortment enhancements as well as the impact of the sales slowdown that occurred in the second quarter, our quarter-end inventory position was relatively healthy. And of course, given our cost of sales outlook for the back half of the year, we will continue to monitor our receipts and inventory levels closely. 
Let's now turn to capital deployment. As we mentioned in our last conference call, this quarter, we deployed about $1 billion to settle a portion of our first quarter debt tenders -- tender offers, and we funded a $750 million debt maturity in July. In addition, during the quarter, we returned another $1.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends of $330 million and share repurchase of more than $1.3 billion. By the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, consistent with the guidance we provided in our first quarter conference call. 
One other note. Through the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately $8.8 billion of shares under the current -- company's current $10 billion repurchase authorization. As a result, we plan to request additional repurchase capacity from our board in the next several months given that our outlook anticipates continued cash available for share repurchase going forward. 
I want to reiterate that our priorities for capital deployment have not changed. First, we fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and intend to build on our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we return cash to -- by repurchasing shares when we have the capacity within the limits of our A credit -- long-term credit rating. Looking ahead, we will continue to govern the pace and magnitude of share repurchase in support of our goal to maintaining those credit ratings. 
Despite the challenging environment, our business continues to generate very strong returns. For the 12-month period through second quarter, we reported an after-tax return on invested capital of 15.8%, up from 13.3% a year ago. I'll quickly note, however, that this year's ROIC includes the onetime gain from the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS, which occurred last December. Without that onetime benefit, our second quarter after-tax ROIC was still a very healthy 13.7%, up about 40 basis points from last year. 
Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss the factors that are shaping our expectations going forward. Obviously, one consideration is the sales and traffic environment we've faced over the last several months, in which overall trends have been challenging and weekly and regional patterns have been more variable than normal. 
The second consideration pertains to the relative benefit of planning our business conservatively. If actual sales turn out to be stronger than our expectations, our teams are prepared to chase inventory and ramp up hours in our stores and distribution centers. In those situations, we generally generate healthy profit rates on incremental sales. However, those same profit dynamics typically work in reverse when we miss our sales outlook given that it's more difficult to cancel orders and to pull back on labor hours. So despite the fact that we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and we're taking steps to address some of the company-specific challenges Brian addressed earlier, we believe it's appropriate to temper our near-term sales and EPS expectations. 
So let's turn first to our outlook for the third quarter, beginning with sales. This quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales range of a minus 2% to flat, consistent with our second quarter guidance. If our comp sales are near the midpoint of that range, we expect to generate gross margin and SG&A expense rates similar to last year's level. This expectation reflects the continued benefit from the removal of the pharmacy sales from this year's results, offset by a continuation of the headwinds we faced in the second quarter. 
One note. The pharmacy sales is expected to cause a delta of a little more than 6 percentage points between comp sales and total sales this quarter, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we expect to deleverage depreciation and amortization line in the third quarter as the depreciation and amortization dollars are expected to be essentially flat to last year but spread over a smaller sales base. 
Altogether, in the third quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.95. As we look beyond the third quarter, we are planning fourth quarter comp sales in the same range as third quarter. And given our third and fourth quarter profit outlook, combined with our year-to-date performance through the second quarter, we're planning to generate full year adjusted EPS of $4.80 to $5.20. We expect full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be about $0.44 lower than adjusted EPS as a result of the debt retirement and pharmacy transaction costs, which we recorded in the first half of the year. 
While this outlook for full year EPS is somewhat lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year, it reflects healthy profit performance in the face of challenging sales, and consistent with our performance through the first half of the year, it reflects the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives and disciplined management by our team. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to thank the team for making cost control a long-term habit not a short-term focus. Last year, we announced a plan to save $2 billion over 2 years, and I'm pleased to say that we're not only running ahead of that goal, but the team continues to find new opportunities to eliminate unnecessary costs and activities. These savings allow us to reinvest resources in our enterprise priorities while still generating solid financial performance even in challenging times. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

As we think about the rebalancing and the work that we're doing from a merchandising standpoint, an in-store presentation standpoint and also a weekly advertising standpoint, we recognize we have to continue to deliver the right presentation for that stock-up occasion and, particularly in the back half of the month, have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right availability of the items our guest is looking for in that fill-in occasion. So we're activating and ensuring we put those changes in place to find the balance as we speak today. So we're certainly very focused and aware of the fact that we have to win on both fronts.

It's not a surprise to us that there's been some disruption, and I think for all of us on the call, we know what it's like when we change a pharmacy prescription and move from one provider to another. And while they're staying in our location, they've got to sign up for some new programs. They're entering a new environment. There is some time that that's going to take, but we've been very pleased. John's been working with his CVS counterparts on the transition. We've had great collaboration and great partnership. We're starting to activate the marketing and the personalized messaging, and we expect, over time, we'll see that business accelerate.

And over the last couple of years, while we've done it in a very disciplined fashion category by category, and I appreciate hearing you say that you've seen improvement in execution and, hopefully, in presentation, we've added thousands of new items, and we've worked with our vendor partners to make sure we're bringing the right innovation category by category. Our team is absolutely going literally item by item, commodity by commodity to look at how we source and how we flow product to improve freshness and the quality we present to our guest. So we've got to make sure we have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right quality. We have to have the right promotional strategy to compete, but we're playing to win both short and long term. We think it's very important that we continue to make progress in this space. We're going to make sure we do it in a very focused manner. We really like what we're seeing in LA25. We're not going to roll it out to 1,800 stores tomorrow. We're making sure that we can validate what's working and how can we drive profitable sales in that space, but we are playing to win in Food, and we're going to continue to roll up our sleeves and make sure that we're into the details, finding ways to unlock the growth potential in that critically important category."

So it's why we're spending time looking at LA25. It's why we've been testing a number of different features throughout our stores from Apparel to Home to Food. It's why we're so excited about investing in flex-formats, where we see a very strong response from the guest. Those are delivering very strong returns, well ahead of our original plan, and Food plays an important part in those smaller flex-formats. So despite what you may be hearing, we have absolutely complete support from the board to make sure we're investing capital behind the initiatives that are going to drive future growth. So again, we're not playing for just the short term. We're playing for the long term. Those capital investments have to be done on behalf of the guest and our shareholders, but we're looking right now at a number of different opportunities to continue to invest to drive growth. So there's no hesitancy at all in making those investments. And as you just said, Food and perishable and consumable categories will play a very important role in driving traffic to our stores and in the future, we've got to continue to bundle that with the work John's doing to make sure -- and we're investing and improving our in-store pickup processes and experience. That's an investment we're making and an investment we're making for the holiday season. We're continuing to invest in our digital assets.

I talked earlier about the fact that we've got to be rebalancing our messaging, and we've done a really terrific job of elevating our messaging and communication around our signature and, particularly, our Style categories. As we go forward, I've used this term before, we've got to make sure we're rebalancing. And we've got to make sure we continue to elevate our messaging, our communication around Style and those core household essential categories, which include Food, that drive traffic to our store and are important to our guest. So making sure we go back to the brand promise. We've got to make sure those Expect More categories, like Style, we continue to elevate, and we've got to make sure we deliver the Pay Less component and ensure that we balance the work that we're doing from a Style standpoint with the progress we're making on those core household essentials, which include Food in that offering. So it's a really important question. It's certainly a big area of focus for us in the balance of the year and into 2017, and I think it's going to be part of the formula that drives traffic back to our stores and improves comp store growth over the balance of the year and into 2017.

Our second quarter comparable sales decline of 1.1% was near the middle of our guidance range for the quarter but well below the results we expect to deliver over time. Against that backdrop, we reported much stronger-than-expected profitability. This outperformance was driven by our ongoing cost-saving efforts, which benefited both our gross margin and expense rates in the second quarter. These benefits helped to offset pressure from the current promotional environment, declining comp sales and the investments we're making in our team. I want to pause and thank our team for delivering this outstanding financial performance. 
At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are committed, first and foremost, to restoring positive comp sales growth in the quarters and years ahead. Based on the conversations with many of you, we know there's a great deal of focus on the broad macro challenges facing retailers, including a consumer focused on experiences, the impact of price deflation and a channel shift into digital. These are real challenges, but they are not new to our business. With the right strategy and strong execution, we've demonstrated our ability to perform in the face of those challenges, and our expectation is that we will continue to be a top retail performer over time. 
In the second quarter, our #1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories, and consistent with the first quarter, we saw higher-than-normal variability in sales patterns. Despite these challenges, we're encouraged that we saw the strongest sales performance around key second quarter events, including Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and the beginning of the Back-to-School season. 
As we analyze the drivers of our second quarter performance, we've identified some company-specific challenges we are actively addressing. This includes meaningful pressure in Electronics, where we saw a double-digit decline in comp sales this quarter, accounting for approximately 70 basis points of overall comp decline. Notably, about 1/3 of this pressure was driven by Apple products, which were down more than 20% in the quarter. We're focused on reversing these trends, and we're collaborating with Apple and other vendor partners to evolve our assortment and accelerate innovation to deliver stronger sales. 
In Grocery, despite improvements in assortments, quality, freshness, presentation and in-stock, we were disappointed with our sales performance as we saw a small comp sales decline in the second quarter. While our Grocery business was negatively impacted by Food deflation, which accounted for about 20 basis points of pressure, we clearly have more work to do to unlock the growth potential in this important category. Given our recent performance and the increasingly competitive Food environment, we're revisiting our second half Grocery efforts, from presentation to assortment to promotion, to improve our competitive position. And as I will discuss in a few minutes, we'll be leveraging the learning from our LA25 remodels to help guide our plans going forward. Beyond Food, we are rebalancing our messaging and promotions to ensure we continue to drive strong performance in Style categories and reach consumers who are intently focused on value in this environment. 
Finally, we experienced soft second quarter traffic trends in the pharmacies in our stores as we completed the rebranding transition from Target to CVS across the country. The execution of the transition went very smoothly, and we've been very pleased with the level of collaboration between our teams and our partners at CVS. While it's not surprising that the rebranding activity has resulted in some near-term disruption, we're focused on restoring growth in this traffic-driving area in our stores. 
As a result, we're working closely with our partners at CVS as they launch media, marketing and member engagement campaigns to increase awareness and utilization of CVS pharmacies in our stores. In addition, CVS is executing an in-store engagement campaign and plans to offer special flu shot incentives at the pharmacies in our stores. As we take steps to increase awareness of the CVS-Target partnership, both among our guests and members of the CVS PBM business, we expect to reaccelerate pharmacy traffic in our stores over time. 
Despite this quarter's challenges, we're pleased that the fundamental elements of our strategy are continuing to shape our results. Comparable sales in signature categories continue to lead the company, reflecting investments we've made in quality, presentation and marketing. In the second quarter, comp sales growth in these categories outpaced the company by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Within signature, we saw particular strength in both Kids and Style. Results in Kids reflected the launch of Cat & Jack, which is now positioned to become our biggest own brand. After the July rollout of this brand, we saw double-digit growth in Cat & Jack sales when measured against comparable sales of Circo and Cherokee last year. 
Within Style, we continue to benefit from strength in women's Apparel. We saw a mid-single-digit comp increase in the quarter. This performance was dribbled -- driven by double-digit growth in our Xhilaration brand, which is focused on a younger style-savvy guest. In addition, we're really pleased with the performance of Who What Wear, which is one of the most productive brands on our women's floor pad. As a result, we're expanding the range of this assortment for the fall, inviting more of our guests to enjoy the items from this fashion-forward collaboration. 
Digital sales grew more than 16% in the second quarter on top of 30% growth last year. We continue to invest in Target's digital assets to enhance the guest experience and drive sales in all channels, and our results demonstrate the impact of the investments we've made over time. For example, several years ago, we told you we had an opportunity to improve our digital conversion. Since then, we've invested to improve our conversion performance by streamlining online checkout, making the site more appealing and easy to use, enhancing our personalization capabilities and improving search. 
As a result, for several years in a row, we've seen meaningful improvement in our digital conversion across all platforms, particularly in mobile. In the second quarter, we launched a brand-new fully adaptive site, which means we now provide a seamless experience across all platforms, from desktop to tablets to smartphones. This is increasingly important because, for many guests, a single purchase journey crosses over 2 or more of these digital devices. 
We're really pleased with the results in our new flexible-format stores, which are designed for very dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. These stores allow us to operate in areas we've never been able to serve with our largest-format stores, allowing us to extend our reach to consumers with high affinity for our brand. In July, we opened up new flex-format stores in Washington Square in Philadelphia, Lincoln Park in Chicago, Commonwealth in Boston and Forest Hills in Queens. We're excited to be serving guests in these iconic neighborhoods, and the guest response to these new locations has been fantastic. 
Financially, flexible formats are very successful. The sales productivity is much higher than our company average, and they've been meeting or exceeding our profit targets. In total this year, we're planning to open 14 flex-format stores, including a multilevel location in TriBeCa this October. Based on our experience to date and our investments in capabilities, we're increasingly confident in our ability to successfully open and operate stores in a variety of neighborhood settings across the country. As a result, we're accelerating our pipeline of locations we can open in future years, and we expect flex-format stores to be a key driver of future growth. 
In our existing stores, we continue to invest in presentation and experience, particularly in signature categories. We completed the remodeling of our LA25 test stores in the second quarter, and we're in the early stages of a robust learning plan to measure guest reaction to the changes we've made. Overall, we're encouraged by initial results in these stores, and we're already rolling out some of the innovation from these stores more broadly. Namely, we're pleased with the presentation innovation in Home and Apparel and results from our work to elevate the order pickup experience. So we're already extending these innovations beyond the LA market. 
In addition, the changes we've made to the Food area in the LA25 test stores has really resonated with guests. Grocery sales in these stores are trending 2 to 3 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Relative performance in produce is even stronger, driving perishable comps that are more than 5 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. 
Guests have told us the new Food area now feels more intimate and separate from the rest of the store, providing a distinct Grocery shopping experience they prefer. We're very encouraged with these initial observations, and we'll continue to leverage learning from these stores as we work to improve Grocery performance across the chain. 
We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates a lot of cash even in challenging times. This cash allows us to make long-term investments in our business while returning cash to our shareholders at the same time. In June, we announced that our board had approved a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend, supporting our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. In addition, our cash position allowed us to return well over $1 billion through share repurchase in the second quarter in support of our goal to return $3.5 billion or more this year. 
Looking ahead, we're very excited about the Back-to-School and Back-to-College season, which is second only to the fourth quarter holiday season in terms of importance. In Back-to-School, we continue to work with kids and parents to inform our product design and development process. So it's only natural that this year, we engaged with kids to design and execute our Back-to-School marketing campaign. Kids led all aspects of this campaign: drafting storyboards, illustrating creative content, directing the spots and performing the music. 
To make shopping fast and convenient for busy families, this year, we partnered with teacherlists.com to make nearly 1 million school supply lists available with our School List Assist tool on target.com. This tool allows parents to quickly and seamlessly purchase supplies off their kids' class lists, arrange for Store Pickup or have the items delivered directly to their home. 
In Back-to-College, our marketing campaign is designed around today's students which are digital natives. In this campaign, we're partnering with 3 recent graduates to create inspiring, do-it-yourself videos to help college students make their new dorm room or apartment feel like home. In addition, we provided tools to make college shopping convenient and fun, including college registry, order pickup, subscriptions and special offers on Cartwheel. As we've done for more than 15 years, we're hosting Back-to-College after-hour shopping events, which will take place at 85 colleges and universities in the next couple of months. In these events, we provide free bus transportation from campus and provide students the opportunity to stock up and save on everything they'll need for school. 
I want to pause here and mention how happy we are to have Mark Tritton on the Target team. Mark took on the role of Chief Merchandising Officer in the second quarter, and he's spent the last couple of months getting to know his team and becoming immersed in our business. Mark is creative and passionate about retail. He's had an amazing career building iconic brands, and I'm confident he'll be able to grow both our own brands and our Target brand. Mark is planning to speak on this conference call next quarter, when he'll outline our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
We continue to believe we're focused on the right strategic priorities, and we're confident in our ability to grow profitably over time. We believe it's appropriate to update our sales and EPS outlook for the remainder of the year. Our decision is informed by the retail sales environment and the variability we continue to see in our weekly and regional results. While we are laser-focused on accelerating traffic and sales, it's prudent to build near-term business and inventory plans that are consistent with recent trends. As always, we'll be prepared to flex those plans upward if results begin to recover in the second half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to John, I want to spend a second with a special thank you to our team and our stores. I visit our stores around the country nearly every week, and I'm so grateful to have a group of such smart and friendly team members serving our guests. John's team at headquarters is focused on ways to simplify our processes, modernize our supply chain and help ensure our stores feature the right assortment of items that are in stock every day. When we back up an outstanding team with the right business fundamentals, we offer an unparalleled experience in retail. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who'll provide more details on his team's efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?"

As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It's long been a key point of differentiation for our brand.

As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It's long been a key point of differentiation for our brand. What I didn't fully appreciate until I came into my new role as COO was the workload that our supply chain processes have been driving into our stores. Historically, when we design processes to improve upstream efficiencies in our supply chain, we often achieve those benefits by moving work and complexity into our stores. 
One of the key priorities of my new team has been to look at the entire supply chain and find ways to optimize it end to end to deliver reliability for our guests while driving efficiency for the organization as a whole. A key measure of reliability is our ability to stay in stock, and I'm pleased that we continue to see improvement even as we begin to compare against improvements from a year ago. In stores, as we entered the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons, Target's overall out-of-stock position was better than we have ever measured historically. In addition, out-of-stocks on frequency and commodity items, the items for which reliability is most important for our guests, are in an even stronger position. And in the digital channel, while we have much work yet to do, we have already reduced out-of-stocks by more than 50% in the last 6 months. 
Our work to reduce variability in our distribution centers has been one of the drivers of these improvements. In the past, an unacceptable number of vendor shipments were received by our DCs either too early or too late. This variability drove a lot of extra workload in the DCs while reducing our reliability downstream. As a result, this year, we have been collaborating with our vendors to increase the percent of shipments that arrive on the correct day, and we've already seen meaningful progress. The percent of shipments that arrive on time has more than doubled, and we expect to see additional improvement as we roll out new processes to additional vendors over time. 
As shipments arrive at our distribution centers, we've made changes to the prioritization of inbound processing, which have already cut the time to unload trailers by more than 50%, and we believe we can cut that time even further. In addition, we've improved process flow between our import warehouses and our regional DCs, reducing the average time it takes for an item in an import warehouse to reach the store shelves by more than half. 
We're also focused on our outbound processing, with a goal of enabling daily deliveries to every store throughout the week regardless of a store's sales volume. When implemented, this change will drive additional improvements to store in-stocks while reducing backroom inventory and store workload. I want to thank the entire team, from merchandise planning to our distribution centers, logistics teams and our stores, for these improvements. Without the engagement of the entire end-to-end supply chain, we couldn't have made such amazing progress. 
Before I move on to our work in the stores, I want to comment briefly on our overall inventory position. As we've mentioned over the last several quarters, a portion of our year-over-year inventory growth reflects intentional investments we're making in nonseasonal commodity categories to support in-stock improvement on items most important to our guests. In addition, our second quarter inventory reflected an investment to offer additional items in certain categories as we work with merchant teams to reliably offer appropriate assortment, both online and in our stores, to best serve our guests. 
Beyond our upstream supply chain work, our investment in self-checkout lanes is also reducing store workload, freeing up time for our store teams to focus on guest service while providing our guests a checkout option that many of them prefer. As of today, we have self-checkout in just over 1,000 of our stores. We're planning to add it to another 200 stores by the end of the year, and we will continue the rollout through 2017. In stores with self-checkout, nearly 1/3 of transactions go through these lanes, much higher than our initial projections. 
Our flexible fulfillment initiatives, including Store Pickup and ship-from-store, are one way we're reinvesting store labor savings to serve guests in new ways. At the end of 2015, more than 460 stores were shipping items directly to guest homes, and we're planning to double our capacity this year by expanding this capability to more than 500 additional stores. These additional locations will further improve our average ship time while providing deeper access to our store inventories, increasing the likelihood that we can ship a guest's entire order from a single nearby store location. And importantly, because we are now prepositioning high-velocity, web-only items in the back room of ship-from-store locations, we are able to reduce last mile and split shipment expenses dramatically. 
In-store pickup is an increasingly popular option for many of our guests. This year, we've seen 50% growth in pickup orders on top of 60% growth a year ago. Year-to-date, more than 90% of our pickup orders have been ready in 1 hour, and we've implemented process improvements to reduce wait times in stores. As a result, guest satisfaction with the pickup experience is up from a year ago, and a higher percent of guests are repeatedly using this service. 
To prepare for this holiday season's surge, we're investing to ensure our stores can continue to deliver a great pickup experience in the face of rapidly increasing demand. In 75 of our highest volume stores, we're increasing holding capacity to allow our team to retrieve items more quickly even during peak times. We're also investing in additional digital devices to support peak demand, and across all of our stores, we're rolling out new guidance on how our stores can optimize their storage space to enhance speed and efficiency. 
New this year, we've implemented systems and processes to allow stores to forecast and monitor pickup demand, ensuring we maintain proper staffing levels. In addition, during the holiday season, about 300 stores will be testing separate branded shirts for the team members in the pickup area and distinctive bags for pickup orders to underscore our commitment to this experience. 
Finally, as Brian mentioned, Back-to-School, Back-to-College season is our second most important sales driver of the year. As a result, we're planning to carefully measure our pickup reliability and speed during promotional peaks this quarter so we can apply those learnings in time for the holiday season when peak demand will be even higher. 
It was just a year ago that I began working with my new team, and I'm very proud of what we've accomplished since then. However, I'm also energized by the opportunities still ahead of us to further increase the speed, flexibility and reliability of our supply chain, to drive unnecessary workload out of our stores and to enable operational excellence across the organization. As we work to accomplish these goals, I'm fortunate to work with an experienced team, led by both internal talent and some amazing new hires, and I'm confident that with their leadership, we will continue to improve Target's operations on behalf of our guests. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?"

Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.17 of debt retirement costs due to settlement timing on a subset of our first quarter debt tender offers. 
This quarter's profit performance was quite impressive in light of the challenging sales environment. Specifically, comparable sales declined 1.1% this quarter, in line with our guidance and well below our plan at the beginning of the year. As expected, the total sales in the second quarter were down more than 7% from last year, driven by the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS. Digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, contributing 0.5 point of our comparable sales growth. 
Looking at the components of our comparable sales. Comp transactions declined 2.2%, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average ticket. While ticket growth was broadly consistent with the last couple of years, traffic performance showed a meaningful change from prior trend. I want to pause and make it clear that we are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance, and as Brian described earlier, we are taking steps to grow both our traffic and sales over time. 
REDcard penetration was 23.9% in the first quarter, up about 180 basis points from last year. However, given that last year's pharmacy sales had a much lower-than-average REDcard penetration, the removal of those sales from this year's results drove a portion of the penetration improvement. Excluding net benefit, REDcard penetration was up about 70 basis points from a year ago. 
Moving down the P&L. Our second quarter EBITDA margin rate was 11.2%, up about 30 basis points from 10.9% a year ago. This improvement was entirely driven by a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate, partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A expense rate. Among the drivers of our gross margin rate, the pharmacy sales drove about 70 basis points of improvement from last year. This improvement was offset by pressure from shipping expense resulting from online growth, along with the impact of second quarter promotional and clearance markdowns, partially offset by the benefit of our cost-control efforts. 
On the SG&A line, we saw pressure from investments in our team and in marketing, along with the deleveraging impact of the decline in sales. These pressures were offset by the rate impact of the pharmacy sale combined with the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives. Overall, we saw a year-over-year increase in our SG&A expense rate of about 20 basis points. Given the pressures we were facing, this is really impressive expense performance, and I want to thank the team for their tireless efforts to control costs. 
Quarter-end inventory was up a little more than 4%, consistent with last quarter. Given the investments we've made in essential categories and assortment enhancements as well as the impact of the sales slowdown that occurred in the second quarter, our quarter-end inventory position was relatively healthy. And of course, given our cost of sales outlook for the back half of the year, we will continue to monitor our receipts and inventory levels closely. 
Let's now turn to capital deployment. As we mentioned in our last conference call, this quarter, we deployed about $1 billion to settle a portion of our first quarter debt tenders -- tender offers, and we funded a $750 million debt maturity in July. In addition, during the quarter, we returned another $1.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends of $330 million and share repurchase of more than $1.3 billion. By the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, consistent with the guidance we provided in our first quarter conference call. 
One other note. Through the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately $8.8 billion of shares under the current -- company's current $10 billion repurchase authorization. As a result, we plan to request additional repurchase capacity from our board in the next several months given that our outlook anticipates continued cash available for share repurchase going forward. 
I want to reiterate that our priorities for capital deployment have not changed. First, we fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and intend to build on our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we return cash to -- by repurchasing shares when we have the capacity within the limits of our A credit -- long-term credit rating. Looking ahead, we will continue to govern the pace and magnitude of share repurchase in support of our goal to maintaining those credit ratings. 
Despite the challenging environment, our business continues to generate very strong returns. For the 12-month period through second quarter, we reported an after-tax return on invested capital of 15.8%, up from 13.3% a year ago. I'll quickly note, however, that this year's ROIC includes the onetime gain from the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS, which occurred last December. Without that onetime benefit, our second quarter after-tax ROIC was still a very healthy 13.7%, up about 40 basis points from last year. 
Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss the factors that are shaping our expectations going forward. Obviously, one consideration is the sales and traffic environment we've faced over the last several months, in which overall trends have been challenging and weekly and regional patterns have been more variable than normal. 
The second consideration pertains to the relative benefit of planning our business conservatively. If actual sales turn out to be stronger than our expectations, our teams are prepared to chase inventory and ramp up hours in our stores and distribution centers. In those situations, we generally generate healthy profit rates on incremental sales. However, those same profit dynamics typically work in reverse when we miss our sales outlook given that it's more difficult to cancel orders and to pull back on labor hours. So despite the fact that we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and we're taking steps to address some of the company-specific challenges Brian addressed earlier, we believe it's appropriate to temper our near-term sales and EPS expectations. 
So let's turn first to our outlook for the third quarter, beginning with sales. This quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales range of a minus 2% to flat, consistent with our second quarter guidance. If our comp sales are near the midpoint of that range, we expect to generate gross margin and SG&A expense rates similar to last year's level. This expectation reflects the continued benefit from the removal of the pharmacy sales from this year's results, offset by a continuation of the headwinds we faced in the second quarter. 
One note. The pharmacy sales is expected to cause a delta of a little more than 6 percentage points between comp sales and total sales this quarter, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we expect to deleverage depreciation and amortization line in the third quarter as the depreciation and amortization dollars are expected to be essentially flat to last year but spread over a smaller sales base. 
Altogether, in the third quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.95. As we look beyond the third quarter, we are planning fourth quarter comp sales in the same range as third quarter. And given our third and fourth quarter profit outlook, combined with our year-to-date performance through the second quarter, we're planning to generate full year adjusted EPS of $4.80 to $5.20. We expect full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be about $0.44 lower than adjusted EPS as a result of the debt retirement and pharmacy transaction costs, which we recorded in the first half of the year. 
While this outlook for full year EPS is somewhat lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year, it reflects healthy profit performance in the face of challenging sales, and consistent with our performance through the first half of the year, it reflects the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives and disciplined management by our team. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to thank the team for making cost control a long-term habit not a short-term focus. Last year, we announced a plan to save $2 billion over 2 years, and I'm pleased to say that we're not only running ahead of that goal, but the team continues to find new opportunities to eliminate unnecessary costs and activities. These savings allow us to reinvest resources in our enterprise priorities while still generating solid financial performance even in challenging times. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

Well, let me try to break apart those 3 questions and have Cathy and John jump in as appropriate. As we think about the rebalancing and the work that we're doing from a merchandising standpoint, an in-store presentation standpoint and also a weekly advertising standpoint, we recognize we have to continue to deliver the right presentation for that stock-up occasion and, particularly in the back half of the month, have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right availability of the items our guest is looking for in that fill-in occasion. So we're activating and ensuring we put those changes in place to find the balance as we speak today. So we're certainly very focused and aware of the fact that we have to win on both fronts.

So we're drilling down on that, and as we think about our plans for the second half of the year, we're building market-specific action plans to make sure we address the market-specific needs of our stores and our guests."

We are very pleased with the financial results we announced earlier this morning. While we have much more work to do, this quarter, we saw meaningful progress in our efforts to improve our traffic and sales as both metrics improved by about a percentage point compared with the second quarter. In addition, we generated much stronger-than-expected EPS performance, driven by strong signature category growth, favorable results in Back-to-School and Back-to-College season and the continued benefit of our cost savings efforts. 
Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.04 was 22.1% higher than last year and well beyond the high end of the guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. With this outstanding third quarter performance, Target's adjusted EPS has grown more than 10% through the first 3 quarters of the year. This is particularly strong performance given that we've experienced flat comparable sales growth during this period. 
In addition, our business continues to generate very strong after-tax returns on invested capital. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, we reported a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 14.3%, excluding the onetime benefit of the gain on the sale of our pharmacy business. This performance represents an increase of approximately 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Of course, strong cash generation by our business allows us to continue to fund a healthy level of investment in our stores, supply chain and technology while funding robust cash returns to our investors. In the third quarter, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders on the form of dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've already returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. 
I'd like to pause and thank our team for their boundless energy and passion to serve our guests by offering them unique merchandise, outstanding service and a best-in-class experience. They deserve all the credit for our outstanding financial results this quarter. 
As I look ahead, I'm really excited about our holiday merchandising and marketing plans, and I'm confident that our outstanding team will bring those plans to life for our guests in our stores and digital channels throughout the holiday season. Our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress on many of our strategic priorities, reflecting our work on category roles. Sales in signature categories accelerated in the third quarter, outcomping the company average by more than 3 percentage points. 
Signature growth was the key driver behind healthy comp increases in both Home and Apparel, and we continue to see market share gains in these important categories. Consistent with our recent strength around events and holidays, third quarter sales in the Back-to-School, Back-to-College season were very strong, resulting in favorable gross margin mix in our sales. In addition, our gross margin rate continues to reflect the cost of goods benefit of our ongoing cost-control initiatives. 
Within our signature category results, we're seeing exceptional growth in our 2 new brands we launched earlier this year: Pillowfort in Kids Home and Cat & Jack in Kids Apparel. We developed these new brands in collaboration with both kids and their parents, and our guests continue to respond to the unique combination of style, quality and value these new brands deliver. 
We also continue to see robust growth in our digital sales. Digital sales grew more than 26% in the third quarter, and they've grown more than 20% year-to-date. This year, we have devoted both capital and expense to improve the digital experience, increase reliability and create additional capacity, and we're seeing really encouraging results. 
This quarter, we ran a promotion that, among other things, allowed us to stress test our systems in advance of the fourth quarter. This promotion was an unprecedented and compelling offer for our guests, 10% off our entire assortment on both stores and digital channel. As you'd expect, the offer drove strong traffic and sales in all channels, but our digital comp in that day was particularly high. In the face of very strong surge in traffic, I'm happy to report that our system performed very well, providing us valuable insight as we prepare for even bigger days this holiday season. 
Last year, to support our strategic investments in Target's digital capabilities, supply chain and store experience, we launched a comprehensive cost savings effort to free up resources and create capacity, and our team has really delivered. We had an ambitious goal: to take a total of $2 billion out of Target's expenses and cost of goods over a 2-year period. Yet as we approach the end of that 2-year period, I'm pleased that our team has actually exceeded our $2 billion goal, and importantly, the team has identified additional opportunities we'll pursue in future years. The ability to create additional capacity is critical given the sizable investments we'll continue to make as we position our business for long-term growth. 
Finally, we are really excited about the continued strong performance of our new flexible-format stores. These new locations allow us to reach new neighborhoods in dense urban and suburban markets. We opened another 5 of these stores across the country in the third quarter, including our fantastic new store in the TriBeCa neighborhood of New York City. 
When we open and operate these stores, we go beyond legacy systems and processes, customizing the assortment and operations that fit the characteristics of the individual neighborhoods in which we operate, and we continue to see phenomenal responses from our guests. Including this quarter's opening, we are now operating nearly 30 of these new-format stores. Based on their performance, we are increasingly confident in the opportunity for Target to profitably operate hundreds of urban flex-format stores over time, reaching new neighborhoods where consumers have a strong affinity for our brand. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we are continuing to address the challenges I described on our last conference call. First and foremost is traffic. And while we saw considerable improvement this quarter, we are committed to growing our comp traffic and sales over time. A key factor is our ability to deliver on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, and our signature category performance demonstrates that we continue to deliver on the Expect More side. 
However, earlier this year, we began to fall short in communicating value to support the Pay Less side both in our stores and in our marketing. In the third quarter, we began to address that imbalance by communicating our commitment to value more clearly. We believe those changes were instrumental in driving improved traffic and comp sales in the third quarter. Going forward, we are committed to striking the appropriate balance in all of our marketing communications. 
We also continue our work to improve the performance of our assortment of convenient, self-service Food in our stores. We saw another small decline in Food comp sales in the third quarter, reflecting near-term challenges presented by deflation and an intensely competitive environment. Despite these near-term challenges, we are focused on delivering stronger growth over time, and Mark will outline his team's plans in a few minutes. 
In addition, comp sales in our Electronics and Entertainment categories continue to underperform the company average. However, in the third quarter, we were encouraged to see a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products, driven by their introduction of several new product innovations. As you know, Electronics, Entertainment and Toys are key gifting categories in the fourth quarter, and the team is excited about their plans to compete and win at this critical time. 
Finally, we continue to work with CVS to drive script count growth in the pharmacies in our stores. As a result of our coordinated marketing efforts, which included our stores, our weekly ads and CVS direct communication to their PBM members, we measured an increase in consumer awareness of the transition of our stores' pharmacies to CVS, and we've seen a corresponding improvement in the script trend in these pharmacies. We continue to believe our CVS partnership will be an important traffic driver over time, and we expect to see significant improvement in 2017. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to pause and reflect on the progress and the business results through the first 3 quarters of the year. When you focus on the top line, you'll see that we've generated essentially flat comps through the first 9 months of the year. This is well below the expectation we had at the beginning of the year, and our first and highest priority is restore growth to the traffic and sales trend. 
However, when you move to the bottom line, you'll see that we've grown adjusted earnings per share more than 10% in the first 9 months of the year. This is outstanding performance, but it's particularly noteworthy in light of the sales challenges we've been facing. The performance is a testament to the resilience of our underlying business, our strategy and, of course, our team, the best team in retail. 
Now I'd like to welcome Mark Tritton onto the call. Mark comes to us with an impressive history in retail merchandising with experience at Nike, Timberland and, most recently, Nordstrom. Mark is a merchant's merchant and a strong leader. Since he arrived at Target, I've been impressed with how quickly he's become immersed in our business and integrated into our team. We're excited to have Mark leading merchandising, and I know he's excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and beyond. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark so he can provide more details on the category performance in the third quarter and our plans to win during the holiday season and beyond. Mark?"

I'm so happy to be joining all of you on the call today. I look forward to meeting with you in New York this spring. 
As Brian mentioned, I spent the last several months digging into our business, understanding Target's strength and exploring where we have the biggest opportunities to grow. And what I found is we have a strong business as it stands today, a powerful Target brand, an impressive own brand portfolio, great-looking stores, a friendly and engaged team and a huge base of passionate guests. With these strengths, we also have an amazing opportunity in front of us. It's been energizing to dig in with the team to develop merchandising plan to drive Target's future growth. I look forward to sharing our vision in detail with you at our Financial Community Meeting. 
For today, I'm going to focus on our recent performance and our plans for this quarter and the holiday season. In the third quarter, sales performance improved across nearly every part of our business. Comp sales in Apparel and Home accelerated the most, providing a positive mix benefit on the gross margin line. Strong execution and markdown management compounded that benefit, leading to much stronger-than-expected gross margin in the quarter. 
As Brian mentioned, we saw very strong trends in Back-to-School and Back-to-College, reflecting our focus on key growth categories and the benefit of improvements we made to our promotional cadence. Digital growth played big role in the season, particularly in Home, which is already one of our biggest and most profitable categories online.  We've continued to see the fastest growth in signature categories sales. 
A few of the highlights from the third quarter include Kids, where we've seen an outstanding performance in Cat & Jack and Pillowfort. We've also continued to generate strong comps in women's ready-to-wear on top of outstanding growth in 2015, and within Home, our results were strongest in the decor and Seasonal categories. 
Given this strong growth in signature, both Home and Apparel saw low single-digit growth in comp sales this quarter, extending our record of market share gains in these strategically important categories. As Brian mentioned, in Electronics, recent product launches helped improved trends in Apple this quarter. However, we continue to see soft trends in mobile phones overall, which is what we've seen in the industry as upgrade cycles are lengthening. 
In Food and beverage, we saw another small comp sales decline this quarter. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we have an opportunity to more clearly convey and resonate value for our guests in this important category. This is being done through our end-cap presentations, enhancing our use of local pricing and making changes to our promotional cadence, and we expect to see the full benefit from these changes in the fourth quarter. 
In essentials, where we identified a similar opportunity, we've seen faster progress. As a result, comp sales grew in essentials in the third quarter, and we expect to see continued progress this quarter. 
Also, as Brian mentioned before, we've seen meaningful improvement in script counts in the CVS pharmacies in our stores. We're also seeing higher guest services scores compared with the period prior to and particularly during the conversion of our pharmacies. These improvements show that our guests are moving beyond the temporary disruption caused by those conversions, and with the disruption behind them, they're responding to the services and capabilities that CVS can provide. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to build on our momentum from the third quarter. 
Target is a destination for season, and no season is more important than the holiday. In Home, we're looking to build on last year's success, when we saw the biggest comp growth in more than a decade. Our holiday décor assortment will feature products by some 3 key Seasonal trends: traditional, Nordic and modern. New this year, we've created Wondershop, a destination in our stores and on target.com that will grab guests' attention and put them in the mood to shop for the season. 
Wondershop features thousands of new holiday interim items. In fact, about 70% of the assortment is new this year. We're also bringing back to the holidays our collaboration with stationery designer Sugar Paper, which was a big hit last year. This features a limited edition collection ranging from $1.50 to up to $15. 
Holiday is an important Apparel season for families, and we're well positioned to deliver for our guests with our new Cat & Jack collection. This new brand has hit a sweet spot with millennial parents in particular, and we have high expectations for what it can deliver during the holiday season. Between October and December, we are introducing more than 1,000 new pieces to our Cat & Jack assortment. Each piece is under $30, which is unbeatable value when you consider the design and quality. 
As Brian also shared, Toys play a key role in the fourth quarter. In fact, we do about 50% of our annual toy sales during this time frame, and this year, we're building on 10 consecutive quarters of growth in Toys, reflecting our investments in units, differentiation and collectibility. This holiday season, we've added nearly 1,800 new and exclusive toys, up more than 15% from last year. 
As you recall, Target had the #1 market share in Star Wars last year. This fall, we have once again led the market with launch of our Rogue One assortment, and for holiday, we're featuring more than 100 new products. Beyond Star Wars, Disney princesses continue to do very well. Elsa from Frozen remains our top seller,  selling more than the other 11 princesses combined. 
An emerging trend in board games has been a bright spot for us this year as families are looking for activities that bring them together. We've seen double-digit growth in board games so far this year, and we've got 50 Target-exclusive games this season for you. 
In Electronics this quarter, we are planning for strong demand for Apple new products given that preorder volume was 3x higher than last year. We're also expecting a lot of guest interest in virtual reality, along with connected home devices like Google Home. Elevated service in our Electronics department is also important to help make shopping in this area a more enjoyable experience for our guests and drive incremental sales in our stores. There are more than 1,500 stores transitioning from Target Mobile reps who are focused only on mobile to Target tech. The scope will include all of Electronics. 
Last year, our exclusive CD from Adele was a massive hit through the holiday season. This year, we've got a collaboration with Garth Brooks, and we expect it to be huge. Target's 10-disc box set includes Garth's new album with 2 exclusive tracks, including the much hyped 25th anniversary edition of Friends in Low Places. By the way, Target is the only place you'll ever be able to find that track. The set went on sale for $29.99 on November 11, 2 weeks before Garth's new album will be available at other retailers. 
This year in Food and beverage, about 20% of our national brand holiday assortment is exclusive to Target, and we've more than doubled our assortment of craft beers from last year, growing from about 700 to nearly 1,500 options across the country. 
In our marketing and promotion, we're coordinating everything for our guests, inspiring them with providing ease and convenience during a stressful time of the year. From the Wondershop to the Wonderlist gift guide and the kid's Wish List app, we're making it easy and fun for guests to find the right gift for everyone on their list. 
Guests loved our 10 Days of Deals last year, so we're bringing back these popular promotions on the days leading up to and following Black Friday.  Based on guest insight, we've optimized this year's cadence of deals and simplified offers to make them easy to understand. In addition, we've worked with our stores to streamline guest communication, freeing up store teams to serve our guests during the busiest time of the year. 
And finally, throughout the season, our broadcast ads will build excitement for the release of The Toycracker, our take on the classic story of The Nutcracker. We'll release this new holiday story in 2 4-minute segments during the world broadcast premiere of Frozen on December 11. Kids of all ages will not want to miss it. With all this amazing content, I hope you can see why we are so excited about our merchandise, promotion and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
However, as we all know, these plans will only come to life through the work of our operations team. So now I'm going to turn the call over to John, who will outline how his team is prepared to deliver on those plans and provide outstanding service to our guests throughout the holiday season. John?"
174438,381624164,1087486,"Target Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season. And as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we're well pos",989,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season. And as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we're well positioned to deliver great guest service and a better experience in every channel. 
In our stores, we've hired and trained tens of thousands of seasonal team members who are already serving our guests. Notably, despite the tightest labor market conditions we've seen in some time, our hiring and training process went smoothly. In fact, we met our key hiring and training milestones earlier than a year ago. 
When guests shop our stores this holiday season, in addition to great products, displays and services, they'll find our in-stock position is better than we've ever measured, reflecting improvement across every category we sell. And importantly, we're attaining those in-stock levels with lower inventory than a year ago. Over the last 18 months, we've deliberately invested in our inventory position in key commodity categories to ensure we remain in-stock in categories where reliability is most important to our guests. However, now that we've annualized these investments and we're beginning to see the benefit of our work to make our supply chain faster and more reliable, we'll be able to deliver outstanding in-stocks on a smaller base of inventory over time. 
The accuracy of our inventory data is key to our speed and reliability, and we've been investing in our systems and processes to achieve greater accuracy. One example is our implementation of RFID technology in a portion of our Apparel assortment, which is currently in more than 1,600 of our stores. In affected categories, overall inventory accuracy has increased dramatically, meaningfully reducing the number of occasions in which we can't physically locate an item. 
In addition, we've made system changes to optimize replenishment of products that our guests purchase in multiples and make changes to minimum on-hand standards in higher-volume locations, both of which have dramatically reduced out-of-stocks on affected items. We will continue to test and rollout these enhancements throughout next year. 
Because of our efforts to eliminate nonguest-facing work in our stores, the team is delivering outstanding service to our guests while delivering efficiency in support of our cost-control efforts. Through the redesign of our in-store replenishment processes and algorithms, we've reduced store backroom trips dramatically this year, delivering tens of millions of dollars of payroll savings that we've reinvested in service. 
Two areas in which we've invested store labor are the Store Pickup process and our ship-from-store capability. Guests love the flexibility of these capabilities all year but especially during the holiday season. In fact, during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, we expect our stores to fulfill more than half of our digital demand. While this is the third holiday season in which we've offered order pickup in all of our stores, we're planning for volume to grow another 50% from a year ago. 
Since last year, we've added additional holding capacity to more than 80 of our highest-volume pickup locations, and we've invested in scheduling tools and additional digital devices to enable high-volume locations to deliver fast service even in peak times. And this year, in more than 300 of our highest-volume pickup locations, our stores teams will wear unique shirts and deliver separately branded reusable bags to underscore our commitment to the pickup experience. 
By last year's holiday season, about 460 of our stores were shipping directly to our guests, up more than threefold from about 140 stores in 2014. This year, we've extended this capability to another 600 stores, meaning that well over 1,000 of our stores are shipping directly to our guests this season. In total, these stores are expected to ship more than 3x as many units as last year, accounting for about 1/3 of our digital volume during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. 
Shipping from store delivers a number of benefits to our guests and to our business. Most importantly, this capability reduces shipping times, given the proximity of these stores to the vast majority of the U.S. population. With that proximity of guests, we also save on shipping, helping to relieve the pressure from shipping growth in our P&L. It also allows us to balance our inventory across our store network, maintaining in-stocks while reducing markdowns in store locations with heavy inventory. 
And finally, store shipping release pressure on our fulfillment centers, especially during peak season, allowing the entire network to function more effectively. Our 3 delayed allocation centers, which have all come online this year, are another way we upgraded capacity. These facilities will allow us to aggregate inventory in slower-moving but harder-to-forecast categories, allowing us to improve our store allocation without hurting lead times. During peak season, we will be fully utilizing these facilities to free up space in our regional DCs to enhance the overall speed and reliability across our distribution network. 
Finally, as a result of our efforts to optimize inbound processes, we expect to double the percentage of our holiday receipts that are processed within 24 hours of arrival. This will enhance our store in-stocks while freeing up meaningful space in our regional DCs, further enhancing speed and efficiency. 
While we're just getting started, our team is really excited about our progress in modernizing Target's operations, and we're pleased to hear from many of you that you're beginning to notice the difference when you shop with us. While that's great to hear, I want to emphasize that we are not slowing down. Our team is energized and focused on our plans for the next year and beyond, and I look forward to sharing those plans with you in February. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her perspective on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?"
174438,381624164,1087486,"Target Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board.

Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year and well above the top end of our guidance range. This performance would be noteworthy in any environment but is especially impressive given our challenging sales trends. 
Comparable sales declined 0.2% in the third quarter. This was a full percentage point better than our second quarter performance and near the high end of our guidance range. However, it's well below the growth we expect to generate over time. 
With the removal of our pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results, total sales were down nearly 7% in the quarter. Digital sales increased more than 26%, contributing about 70 basis points to our comparable sales. Digital growth was fastest in our signature categories and was particularly strong in Kids, driven by the strength of our Back-to-School offering and the launch of Cat & Jack. This is particularly exciting because signature categories are items and brands uniquely Target. 
Among the components of our comp sales, transactions were down 1.2% in the third quarter and 1 percentage point improvement from the second quarter. Average ticket increased 1%, in line with our performance so far this year. 
I want to pause here and make it clear that while we have made significant progress, we are not satisfied with our third quarter traffic and sales performance. First and foremost, we are focused on restoring growth to both of these metrics over time. Our REDcard program is our most powerful loyalty vehicle, and it's continuing to grow. Sales penetration on our REDcard was 24.3% in the third quarter, in line with our expectation and 2 percentage points ahead of last year. Excluding the benefit from the pharmacy transaction, penetration was up about 80 basis points in the quarter, which is consistent with our year-to-date performance. 
Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.9%, up from 8.6% last year. About 2/3 of this improvement was driven by an increase in our gross margin rate combined with the benefit of a lower SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our gross margin rate improved about 80 basis points compared to last year, which was much stronger than expected. This improvement was entirely driven by merchandise mix resulting from both the pharmacy transaction and strong performance in our signature categories. 
On the SG&A line, we saw about 40 basis points of improvement from a year ago, which reflects the benefit of our ongoing cost-control efforts. As John mentioned, we continue to find ways to eliminate nonguest-facing labor in our stores. This creates capacity that allows our team to focus on guest service while maintaining outstanding efficiencies to support our financial performance. 
For the first time this year, our quarter-end inventory was lower than a year ago. The team has done a fantastic job responding to the recent slowdown in our sales by effectively managing inventory and receipt. With this strong execution, we've seen outstanding gross margin performance so far this year. And as we enter the peak of the holiday season, we feel very good about the level and the composition of our inventory. 
Let's turn now to capital deployment. We paid $345 million in dividends during the third quarter and returned another $878 million through share repurchase. A portion of our third quarter repurchase activity was accomplished through an accelerated share repurchase agreement. A portion of this ASR was settled after the end of the quarter.  Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares, which keeps us on track to invest $3.5 billion or more in share repurchase this year. 
One thing to note is that during the third quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll begin repurchasing shares under this new program when we complete the current $10 billion program. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $300 million of remaining capacity on the current $10 billion program. 
And one other item to note. During the third quarter, we obtained a new $2.5 billion credit facility that expires in October of 2021. This new facility replaces a $2.25 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in 2018. We have never borrowed under any of our prior credit facilities, and we would not expect to borrow under the new one either. However, it provides an important source of backup liquidity, and it serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program, which we use to fund our seasonal borrowing needs. 
Reflecting our focus on disciplined capital deployment, one of our goals is to grow our after-tax return on invested capital into the mid-teens over time. I'm pleased to share that we are making significant progress toward this goal. 
For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 16.3%. However, that calculation includes the onetime gain from the pharmacy sale, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding that gain, our third quarter after-tax ROIC was 14.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Consistent with last quarter, we are maintaining a cautious outlook, given the current environment and the prospect of a very competitive holiday season. With that in mind, we are planning our fourth quarter comparable sales to be roughly consistent with our third quarter performance in a range of around flat, plus or minus 1%. Total sales are expected to decline about 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. This will be the last quarter in which we will be comping over pharmacy and clinic sales from the prior year. 
In terms of operating margin, we're expecting our fourth quarter segment EBIT margin rate will be up slightly, about 10 basis points higher than last year. This outlook is based on an expected 40 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin rate, driven entirely by a lower SG&A expense rate. Offsetting this improvement, we expect to see an increase of about 30 basis points in our depreciation and amortization expense rate. This will be driven by approximately $15 million of accelerated depreciation related to our 2017 store remodel program, along with the deleveraging effects of the total sales decline resulting from the pharmacy transaction. 
Altogether, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.75. When we combine these fourth quarter expectations with our year-to-date performance, we're expecting to generate approximately flat comparable sales for the full year and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.30. Notably, the top half of this updated EPS range is within the range we laid out at the beginning of the year. This demonstrates how effectively our team has performed in the face of unexpected sales challenges. 
Looking into next year, our first focus is to restore growth in our traffic and comparable sales. With sales growth, a strong gross margin mix and continued cost discipline, we believe we can sustainably grow both the top line and the bottom line over time. I look forward to discussing our longer-term aspirations and our outlook for 2017 performance at our meeting with you in February. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who has a few closing remarks. Brian?"

Before we open up for questions, I want to pause and recap our position as we enter the final quarter of the year.

That said, we're very excited about our plans for the holiday season, and our team is focused on outperforming our plans, gaining market share and delivering positive comp sales across our businesses, not just in signature categories. 
On the adjusted EPS line, we have grown more than 10% so far this year. And based on our fourth quarter expectations, our updated range for full year adjusted EPS overlaps with the original guidance range we provided last March, reflecting the team's strong execution in the face of challenging sales trends. Signature category sales continue to far outpace the company average, and we continue to gain market share in these categories. 
And because our digital growth continues to outpace the industry average, we continue to gain share in the digital channel as well. So while we continue to adjust our near-term tactics to better maintain the balance on both sides of our Expect More.

So we think the importance of the in-store experience, great customer service, continuing to bring newness to our assortment, elevating and developing our own brands, I think one of the big highlights for Target in 2016 is the way our guest has reacted to 2 great new brands, both Pillowfort and Cat & Jack have been incredibly well received. The Style, the quality, the value we're delivering is connecting with our guest. So the combination of great in-store experience, making sure we surround our guests with great customer service, whether they're shopping in our store or they've ordered online, and they're coming in to pickup that order and then delivering great Target brands at a value. So we think that combination is the strategy that drives traffic into our stores, cars into our parking lot and even more engagement online."

Those categories did trend downward in Q3. But the important part of the year is in front of us, and I think we're very well positioned. And from a script standpoint, we are still rebuilding the momentum in that space. But sequentially, we've seen improvement from Q1 to Q2 and Q3, and we recognize that with time as the branding's in place, as our in-store marketing and the CVS marketing take shape, we're going to be rebuilding and growing scripts in that very important part of our store."

From a fill-in and stock-up standpoint, again the work that Mark just talked about on the value side is clearly addressing the fill-in guest, and I feel very good about the progress we've made and we'll continue to make in that space. I think to the broader question, it's a terrific way for us to wrap up before we all get together in New York City. We continue to feel very good about the strategy we have in place and how that will allow us to be very competitive and continue to win in the current retail environment. We think the investments we're making in our stores are critically important, and that store experience that we continue to elevate is a very important measure for our guests. We've learned, as I hope you have, guests still like physical stores, and year-to-date, still almost 90% of all retail shopping is taking place in a physical store. So we got to make sure we've got a great experience, we've got great service. We continue to elevate that experience in service and combine it with outstanding merchandise and value every time our guests shop. We think our strategy of moving into new neighborhoods, whether it's these densely populated urban centers or on college campuses, is a critical growth vehicle, and again the reaction we've seen every time we open up a store in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and certainly in New York tells us our guests love the convenience of having Target right there in their neighborhood. But we're also continuing to make investments online, and we want to make sure we continue to give our guests the choice of shopping any way they want, the ease of shopping online and picking up in our store, which we think is going to be a very important factor during the fourth quarter, but building out those capabilities, leveraging our stores as flexible fulfillment centers as we go into this holiday season, well over 1,000 locations will be locations that not you can shop in and pick up, but we're using to deliver the last mile. We think that's a huge competitive advantage. So we feel very good about the strategy we have in place. We think it's a strategy that will win not only in the short term but over the long term, and we look forward to seeing all of you in New York in February. So with that, operator, we're going to wrap up our third quarter call. I appreciate everyone participating, and we look forward to seeing you in New York in February."

We are very pleased with the financial results we announced earlier this morning. While we have much more work to do, this quarter, we saw meaningful progress in our efforts to improve our traffic and sales as both metrics improved by about a percentage point compared with the second quarter. In addition, we generated much stronger-than-expected EPS performance, driven by strong signature category growth, favorable results in Back-to-School and Back-to-College season and the continued benefit of our cost savings efforts. 
Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.04 was 22.1% higher than last year and well beyond the high end of the guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. With this outstanding third quarter performance, Target's adjusted EPS has grown more than 10% through the first 3 quarters of the year. This is particularly strong performance given that we've experienced flat comparable sales growth during this period. 
In addition, our business continues to generate very strong after-tax returns on invested capital. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, we reported a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 14.3%, excluding the onetime benefit of the gain on the sale of our pharmacy business. This performance represents an increase of approximately 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Of course, strong cash generation by our business allows us to continue to fund a healthy level of investment in our stores, supply chain and technology while funding robust cash returns to our investors. In the third quarter, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders on the form of dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've already returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. 
I'd like to pause and thank our team for their boundless energy and passion to serve our guests by offering them unique merchandise, outstanding service and a best-in-class experience. They deserve all the credit for our outstanding financial results this quarter. 
As I look ahead, I'm really excited about our holiday merchandising and marketing plans, and I'm confident that our outstanding team will bring those plans to life for our guests in our stores and digital channels throughout the holiday season. Our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress on many of our strategic priorities, reflecting our work on category roles. Sales in signature categories accelerated in the third quarter, outcomping the company average by more than 3 percentage points. 
Signature growth was the key driver behind healthy comp increases in both Home and Apparel, and we continue to see market share gains in these important categories. Consistent with our recent strength around events and holidays, third quarter sales in the Back-to-School, Back-to-College season were very strong, resulting in favorable gross margin mix in our sales. In addition, our gross margin rate continues to reflect the cost of goods benefit of our ongoing cost-control initiatives. 
Within our signature category results, we're seeing exceptional growth in our 2 new brands we launched earlier this year: Pillowfort in Kids Home and Cat & Jack in Kids Apparel. We developed these new brands in collaboration with both kids and their parents, and our guests continue to respond to the unique combination of style, quality and value these new brands deliver. 
We also continue to see robust growth in our digital sales. Digital sales grew more than 26% in the third quarter, and they've grown more than 20% year-to-date. This year, we have devoted both capital and expense to improve the digital experience, increase reliability and create additional capacity, and we're seeing really encouraging results. 
This quarter, we ran a promotion that, among other things, allowed us to stress test our systems in advance of the fourth quarter. This promotion was an unprecedented and compelling offer for our guests, 10% off our entire assortment on both stores and digital channel. As you'd expect, the offer drove strong traffic and sales in all channels, but our digital comp in that day was particularly high. In the face of very strong surge in traffic, I'm happy to report that our system performed very well, providing us valuable insight as we prepare for even bigger days this holiday season. 
Last year, to support our strategic investments in Target's digital capabilities, supply chain and store experience, we launched a comprehensive cost savings effort to free up resources and create capacity, and our team has really delivered. We had an ambitious goal: to take a total of $2 billion out of Target's expenses and cost of goods over a 2-year period. Yet as we approach the end of that 2-year period, I'm pleased that our team has actually exceeded our $2 billion goal, and importantly, the team has identified additional opportunities we'll pursue in future years. The ability to create additional capacity is critical given the sizable investments we'll continue to make as we position our business for long-term growth. 
Finally, we are really excited about the continued strong performance of our new flexible-format stores. These new locations allow us to reach new neighborhoods in dense urban and suburban markets. We opened another 5 of these stores across the country in the third quarter, including our fantastic new store in the TriBeCa neighborhood of New York City. 
When we open and operate these stores, we go beyond legacy systems and processes, customizing the assortment and operations that fit the characteristics of the individual neighborhoods in which we operate, and we continue to see phenomenal responses from our guests. Including this quarter's opening, we are now operating nearly 30 of these new-format stores. Based on their performance, we are increasingly confident in the opportunity for Target to profitably operate hundreds of urban flex-format stores over time, reaching new neighborhoods where consumers have a strong affinity for our brand. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we are continuing to address the challenges I described on our last conference call. First and foremost is traffic. And while we saw considerable improvement this quarter, we are committed to growing our comp traffic and sales over time. A key factor is our ability to deliver on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, and our signature category performance demonstrates that we continue to deliver on the Expect More side. 
However, earlier this year, we began to fall short in communicating value to support the Pay Less side both in our stores and in our marketing. In the third quarter, we began to address that imbalance by communicating our commitment to value more clearly. We believe those changes were instrumental in driving improved traffic and comp sales in the third quarter. Going forward, we are committed to striking the appropriate balance in all of our marketing communications. 
We also continue our work to improve the performance of our assortment of convenient, self-service Food in our stores. We saw another small decline in Food comp sales in the third quarter, reflecting near-term challenges presented by deflation and an intensely competitive environment. Despite these near-term challenges, we are focused on delivering stronger growth over time, and Mark will outline his team's plans in a few minutes. 
In addition, comp sales in our Electronics and Entertainment categories continue to underperform the company average. However, in the third quarter, we were encouraged to see a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products, driven by their introduction of several new product innovations. As you know, Electronics, Entertainment and Toys are key gifting categories in the fourth quarter, and the team is excited about their plans to compete and win at this critical time. 
Finally, we continue to work with CVS to drive script count growth in the pharmacies in our stores. As a result of our coordinated marketing efforts, which included our stores, our weekly ads and CVS direct communication to their PBM members, we measured an increase in consumer awareness of the transition of our stores' pharmacies to CVS, and we've seen a corresponding improvement in the script trend in these pharmacies. We continue to believe our CVS partnership will be an important traffic driver over time, and we expect to see significant improvement in 2017. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to pause and reflect on the progress and the business results through the first 3 quarters of the year. When you focus on the top line, you'll see that we've generated essentially flat comps through the first 9 months of the year. This is well below the expectation we had at the beginning of the year, and our first and highest priority is restore growth to the traffic and sales trend. 
However, when you move to the bottom line, you'll see that we've grown adjusted earnings per share more than 10% in the first 9 months of the year. This is outstanding performance, but it's particularly noteworthy in light of the sales challenges we've been facing. The performance is a testament to the resilience of our underlying business, our strategy and, of course, our team, the best team in retail. 
Now I'd like to welcome Mark Tritton onto the call. Mark comes to us with an impressive history in retail merchandising with experience at Nike, Timberland and, most recently, Nordstrom. Mark is a merchant's merchant and a strong leader. Since he arrived at Target, I've been impressed with how quickly he's become immersed in our business and integrated into our team. We're excited to have Mark leading merchandising, and I know he's excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and beyond. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark so he can provide more details on the category performance in the third quarter and our plans to win during the holiday season and beyond. Mark?"

I'm so happy to be joining all of you on the call today. I look forward to meeting with you in New York this spring. 
As Brian mentioned, I spent the last several months digging into our business, understanding Target's strength and exploring where we have the biggest opportunities to grow. And what I found is we have a strong business as it stands today, a powerful Target brand, an impressive own brand portfolio, great-looking stores, a friendly and engaged team and a huge base of passionate guests. With these strengths, we also have an amazing opportunity in front of us. It's been energizing to dig in with the team to develop merchandising plan to drive Target's future growth. I look forward to sharing our vision in detail with you at our Financial Community Meeting. 
For today, I'm going to focus on our recent performance and our plans for this quarter and the holiday season. In the third quarter, sales performance improved across nearly every part of our business. Comp sales in Apparel and Home accelerated the most, providing a positive mix benefit on the gross margin line. Strong execution and markdown management compounded that benefit, leading to much stronger-than-expected gross margin in the quarter. 
As Brian mentioned, we saw very strong trends in Back-to-School and Back-to-College, reflecting our focus on key growth categories and the benefit of improvements we made to our promotional cadence. Digital growth played big role in the season, particularly in Home, which is already one of our biggest and most profitable categories online.  We've continued to see the fastest growth in signature categories sales. 
A few of the highlights from the third quarter include Kids, where we've seen an outstanding performance in Cat & Jack and Pillowfort. We've also continued to generate strong comps in women's ready-to-wear on top of outstanding growth in 2015, and within Home, our results were strongest in the decor and Seasonal categories. 
Given this strong growth in signature, both Home and Apparel saw low single-digit growth in comp sales this quarter, extending our record of market share gains in these strategically important categories. As Brian mentioned, in Electronics, recent product launches helped improved trends in Apple this quarter. However, we continue to see soft trends in mobile phones overall, which is what we've seen in the industry as upgrade cycles are lengthening. 
In Food and beverage, we saw another small comp sales decline this quarter. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we have an opportunity to more clearly convey and resonate value for our guests in this important category. This is being done through our end-cap presentations, enhancing our use of local pricing and making changes to our promotional cadence, and we expect to see the full benefit from these changes in the fourth quarter. 
In essentials, where we identified a similar opportunity, we've seen faster progress. As a result, comp sales grew in essentials in the third quarter, and we expect to see continued progress this quarter. 
Also, as Brian mentioned before, we've seen meaningful improvement in script counts in the CVS pharmacies in our stores. We're also seeing higher guest services scores compared with the period prior to and particularly during the conversion of our pharmacies. These improvements show that our guests are moving beyond the temporary disruption caused by those conversions, and with the disruption behind them, they're responding to the services and capabilities that CVS can provide. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to build on our momentum from the third quarter. 
Target is a destination for season, and no season is more important than the holiday. In Home, we're looking to build on last year's success, when we saw the biggest comp growth in more than a decade. Our holiday décor assortment will feature products by some 3 key Seasonal trends: traditional, Nordic and modern. New this year, we've created Wondershop, a destination in our stores and on target.com that will grab guests' attention and put them in the mood to shop for the season. 
Wondershop features thousands of new holiday interim items. In fact, about 70% of the assortment is new this year. We're also bringing back to the holidays our collaboration with stationery designer Sugar Paper, which was a big hit last year. This features a limited edition collection ranging from $1.50 to up to $15. 
Holiday is an important Apparel season for families, and we're well positioned to deliver for our guests with our new Cat & Jack collection. This new brand has hit a sweet spot with millennial parents in particular, and we have high expectations for what it can deliver during the holiday season. Between October and December, we are introducing more than 1,000 new pieces to our Cat & Jack assortment. Each piece is under $30, which is unbeatable value when you consider the design and quality. 
As Brian also shared, Toys play a key role in the fourth quarter. In fact, we do about 50% of our annual toy sales during this time frame, and this year, we're building on 10 consecutive quarters of growth in Toys, reflecting our investments in units, differentiation and collectibility. This holiday season, we've added nearly 1,800 new and exclusive toys, up more than 15% from last year. 
As you recall, Target had the #1 market share in Star Wars last year. This fall, we have once again led the market with launch of our Rogue One assortment, and for holiday, we're featuring more than 100 new products. Beyond Star Wars, Disney princesses continue to do very well. Elsa from Frozen remains our top seller,  selling more than the other 11 princesses combined. 
An emerging trend in board games has been a bright spot for us this year as families are looking for activities that bring them together. We've seen double-digit growth in board games so far this year, and we've got 50 Target-exclusive games this season for you. 
In Electronics this quarter, we are planning for strong demand for Apple new products given that preorder volume was 3x higher than last year. We're also expecting a lot of guest interest in virtual reality, along with connected home devices like Google Home. Elevated service in our Electronics department is also important to help make shopping in this area a more enjoyable experience for our guests and drive incremental sales in our stores. There are more than 1,500 stores transitioning from Target Mobile reps who are focused only on mobile to Target tech. The scope will include all of Electronics. 
Last year, our exclusive CD from Adele was a massive hit through the holiday season. This year, we've got a collaboration with Garth Brooks, and we expect it to be huge. Target's 10-disc box set includes Garth's new album with 2 exclusive tracks, including the much hyped 25th anniversary edition of Friends in Low Places. By the way, Target is the only place you'll ever be able to find that track. The set went on sale for $29.99 on November 11, 2 weeks before Garth's new album will be available at other retailers. 
This year in Food and beverage, about 20% of our national brand holiday assortment is exclusive to Target, and we've more than doubled our assortment of craft beers from last year, growing from about 700 to nearly 1,500 options across the country. 
In our marketing and promotion, we're coordinating everything for our guests, inspiring them with providing ease and convenience during a stressful time of the year. From the Wondershop to the Wonderlist gift guide and the kid's Wish List app, we're making it easy and fun for guests to find the right gift for everyone on their list. 
Guests loved our 10 Days of Deals last year, so we're bringing back these popular promotions on the days leading up to and following Black Friday.  Based on guest insight, we've optimized this year's cadence of deals and simplified offers to make them easy to understand. In addition, we've worked with our stores to streamline guest communication, freeing up store teams to serve our guests during the busiest time of the year. 
And finally, throughout the season, our broadcast ads will build excitement for the release of The Toycracker, our take on the classic story of The Nutcracker. We'll release this new holiday story in 2 4-minute segments during the world broadcast premiere of Frozen on December 11. Kids of all ages will not want to miss it. With all this amazing content, I hope you can see why we are so excited about our merchandise, promotion and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
However, as we all know, these plans will only come to life through the work of our operations team. So now I'm going to turn the call over to John, who will outline how his team is prepared to deliver on those plans and provide outstanding service to our guests throughout the holiday season. John?"
174438,381624164,1087562,"Target Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season. And as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we're well pos",989,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season. And as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we're well positioned to deliver great guest service and a better experience in every channel. 
In our stores, we've hired and trained tens of thousands of seasonal team members who are already serving our guests. Notably, despite the tightest labor market conditions we've seen in some time, our hiring and training process went smoothly. In fact, we met our key hiring and training milestones earlier than a year ago. 
When guests shop our stores this holiday season, in addition to great products, displays and services, they'll find our in-stock position is better than we've ever measured, reflecting improvement across every category we sell. And importantly, we're attaining those in-stock levels with lower inventory than a year ago. Over the last 18 months, we've deliberately invested in our inventory position in key commodity categories to ensure we remain in-stock in categories where reliability is most important to our guests. However, now that we've annualized these investments and we're beginning to see the benefit of our work to make our supply chain faster and more reliable, we'll be able to deliver outstanding in-stocks on a smaller base of inventory over time. 
The accuracy of our inventory data is key to our speed and reliability, and we've been investing in our systems and processes to achieve greater accuracy. One example is our implementation of RFID technology in a portion of our Apparel assortment, which is currently in more than 1,600 of our stores. In affected categories, overall inventory accuracy has increased dramatically, meaningfully reducing the number of occasions in which we can't physically locate an item. 
In addition, we've made system changes to optimize replenishment of products that our guests purchase in multiples and make changes to minimum on-hand standards in higher-volume locations, both of which have dramatically reduced out-of-stocks on affected items. We will continue to test and rollout these enhancements throughout next year. 
Because of our efforts to eliminate nonguest-facing work in our stores, the team is delivering outstanding service to our guests while delivering efficiency in support of our cost-control efforts. Through the redesign of our in-store replenishment processes and algorithms, we've reduced store backroom trips dramatically this year, delivering tens of millions of dollars of payroll savings that we've reinvested in service. 
Two areas in which we've invested store labor are the Store Pickup process and our ship-from-store capability. Guests love the flexibility of these capabilities all year but especially during the holiday season. In fact, during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, we expect our stores to fulfill more than half of our digital demand. While this is the third holiday season in which we've offered order pickup in all of our stores, we're planning for volume to grow another 50% from a year ago. 
Since last year, we've added additional holding capacity to more than 80 of our highest-volume pickup locations, and we've invested in scheduling tools and additional digital devices to enable high-volume locations to deliver fast service even in peak times. And this year, in more than 300 of our highest-volume pickup locations, our stores teams will wear unique shirts and deliver separately branded reusable bags to underscore our commitment to the pickup experience. 
By last year's holiday season, about 460 of our stores were shipping directly to our guests, up more than threefold from about 140 stores in 2014. This year, we've extended this capability to another 600 stores, meaning that well over 1,000 of our stores are shipping directly to our guests this season. In total, these stores are expected to ship more than 3x as many units as last year, accounting for about 1/3 of our digital volume during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. 
Shipping from store delivers a number of benefits to our guests and to our business. Most importantly, this capability reduces shipping times, given the proximity of these stores to the vast majority of the U.S. population. With that proximity of guests, we also save on shipping, helping to relieve the pressure from shipping growth in our P&L. It also allows us to balance our inventory across our store network, maintaining in-stocks while reducing markdowns in store locations with heavy inventory. 
And finally, store shipping release pressure on our fulfillment centers, especially during peak season, allowing the entire network to function more effectively. Our 3 delayed allocation centers, which have all come online this year, are another way we upgraded capacity. These facilities will allow us to aggregate inventory in slower-moving but harder-to-forecast categories, allowing us to improve our store allocation without hurting lead times. During peak season, we will be fully utilizing these facilities to free up space in our regional DCs to enhance the overall speed and reliability across our distribution network. 
Finally, as a result of our efforts to optimize inbound processes, we expect to double the percentage of our holiday receipts that are processed within 24 hours of arrival. This will enhance our store in-stocks while freeing up meaningful space in our regional DCs, further enhancing speed and efficiency. 
While we're just getting started, our team is really excited about our progress in modernizing Target's operations, and we're pleased to hear from many of you that you're beginning to notice the difference when you shop with us. While that's great to hear, I want to emphasize that we are not slowing down. Our team is energized and focused on our plans for the next year and beyond, and I look forward to sharing those plans with you in February. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her perspective on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?"
174438,381624164,1087562,"Target Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year and well above the top end of our g",1271,"Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year and well above the top end of our guidance range. This performance would be noteworthy in any environment but is especially impressive given our challenging sales trends. 
Comparable sales declined 0.2% in the third quarter. This was a full percentage point better than our second quarter performance and near the high end of our guidance range. However, it's well below the growth we expect to generate over time. 
With the removal of our pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results, total sales were down nearly 7% in the quarter. Digital sales increased more than 26%, contributing about 70 basis points to our comparable sales. Digital growth was fastest in our signature categories and was particularly strong in Kids, driven by the strength of our Back-to-School offering and the launch of Cat & Jack. This is particularly exciting because signature categories are items and brands uniquely Target. 
Among the components of our comp sales, transactions were down 1.2% in the third quarter and 1 percentage point improvement from the second quarter. Average ticket increased 1%, in line with our performance so far this year. 
I want to pause here and make it clear that while we have made significant progress, we are not satisfied with our third quarter traffic and sales performance. First and foremost, we are focused on restoring growth to both of these metrics over time. Our REDcard program is our most powerful loyalty vehicle, and it's continuing to grow. Sales penetration on our REDcard was 24.3% in the third quarter, in line with our expectation and 2 percentage points ahead of last year. Excluding the benefit from the pharmacy transaction, penetration was up about 80 basis points in the quarter, which is consistent with our year-to-date performance. 
Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.9%, up from 8.6% last year. About 2/3 of this improvement was driven by an increase in our gross margin rate combined with the benefit of a lower SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our gross margin rate improved about 80 basis points compared to last year, which was much stronger than expected. This improvement was entirely driven by merchandise mix resulting from both the pharmacy transaction and strong performance in our signature categories. 
On the SG&A line, we saw about 40 basis points of improvement from a year ago, which reflects the benefit of our ongoing cost-control efforts. As John mentioned, we continue to find ways to eliminate nonguest-facing labor in our stores. This creates capacity that allows our team to focus on guest service while maintaining outstanding efficiencies to support our financial performance. 
For the first time this year, our quarter-end inventory was lower than a year ago. The team has done a fantastic job responding to the recent slowdown in our sales by effectively managing inventory and receipt. With this strong execution, we've seen outstanding gross margin performance so far this year. And as we enter the peak of the holiday season, we feel very good about the level and the composition of our inventory. 
Let's turn now to capital deployment. We paid $345 million in dividends during the third quarter and returned another $878 million through share repurchase. A portion of our third quarter repurchase activity was accomplished through an accelerated share repurchase agreement. A portion of this ASR was settled after the end of the quarter.  Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares, which keeps us on track to invest $3.5 billion or more in share repurchase this year. 
One thing to note is that during the third quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll begin repurchasing shares under this new program when we complete the current $10 billion program. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $300 million of remaining capacity on the current $10 billion program. 
And one other item to note. During the third quarter, we obtained a new $2.5 billion credit facility that expires in October of 2021. This new facility replaces a $2.25 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in 2018. We have never borrowed under any of our prior credit facilities, and we would not expect to borrow under the new one either. However, it provides an important source of backup liquidity, and it serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program, which we use to fund our seasonal borrowing needs. 
Reflecting our focus on disciplined capital deployment, one of our goals is to grow our after-tax return on invested capital into the mid-teens over time. I'm pleased to share that we are making significant progress toward this goal. 
For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 16.3%. However, that calculation includes the onetime gain from the pharmacy sale, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding that gain, our third quarter after-tax ROIC was 14.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Consistent with last quarter, we are maintaining a cautious outlook, given the current environment and the prospect of a very competitive holiday season. With that in mind, we are planning our fourth quarter comparable sales to be roughly consistent with our third quarter performance in a range of around flat, plus or minus 1%. Total sales are expected to decline about 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. This will be the last quarter in which we will be comping over pharmacy and clinic sales from the prior year. 
In terms of operating margin, we're expecting our fourth quarter segment EBIT margin rate will be up slightly, about 10 basis points higher than last year. This outlook is based on an expected 40 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin rate, driven entirely by a lower SG&A expense rate. Offsetting this improvement, we expect to see an increase of about 30 basis points in our depreciation and amortization expense rate. This will be driven by approximately $15 million of accelerated depreciation related to our 2017 store remodel program, along with the deleveraging effects of the total sales decline resulting from the pharmacy transaction. 
Altogether, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.75. When we combine these fourth quarter expectations with our year-to-date performance, we're expecting to generate approximately flat comparable sales for the full year and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.30. Notably, the top half of this updated EPS range is within the range we laid out at the beginning of the year. This demonstrates how effectively our team has performed in the face of unexpected sales challenges. 
Looking into next year, our first focus is to restore growth in our traffic and comparable sales. With sales growth, a strong gross margin mix and continued cost discipline, we believe we can sustainably grow both the top line and the bottom line over time. I look forward to discussing our longer-term aspirations and our outlook for 2017 performance at our meeting with you in February. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who has a few closing remarks. Brian?"

Before we open up for questions, I want to pause and recap our position as we enter the final quarter of the year. Year-to-date, comp sales have been about flat, and we believe it's prudent to plan for a similar trend in the fourth quarter. That said, we're very excited about our plans for the holiday season, and our team is focused on outperforming our plans, gaining market share and delivering positive comp sales across our businesses, not just in signature categories. 
On the adjusted EPS line, we have grown more than 10% so far this year. And based on our fourth quarter expectations, our updated range for full year adjusted EPS overlaps with the original guidance range we provided last March, reflecting the team's strong execution in the face of challenging sales trends. Signature categories sales continue to far outpace the company average, and we continue to gain market share in these categories. 
And because our digital growth continues to outpace the industry average, we continue to gain share in the digital channel as well. So while we continue to adjust our near-term tactics to better maintain the balance on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, we believe we have the right long-term strategic plan to sustain Target's performance over time. 
I look forward to covering both our fourth quarter results and our longer-term strategic and financial plans at our Financial Community Meeting, which we'll be hosting in New York on February 28. We'll be providing more detail on timing and location soon. But in the meantime, please mark your calendars for that date. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Cathy, Mark, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

I think to the broader question, it's a terrific way for us to wrap up before we all get together in New York City. We continue to feel very good about the strategy we have in place and how that will allow us to be very competitive and continue to win in the current retail environment. We think the investments we're making in our stores are critically important, and that store experience that we continue to elevate is a very important measure for our guests. We've learned, as I hope you have, guests still like physical stores, and year-to-date, still almost 90% of all retail shopping is taking place in a physical store. So we've got to make sure we've got a great experience, we've got great service. We continue to elevate that experience and service and combine it with outstanding merchandise and value every time our guests shop. We think our strategy of moving into new neighborhoods, whether it's these densely populated urban centers or on college campuses, is a critical growth vehicle, and again, the reaction we've seen every time we open up a store in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and certainly in New York tells us our guests love the convenience of having Target right there in their neighborhood. But we're also continuing to make investments online, and we want to make sure we continue to give our guests the choice of shopping any way they want, the ease of shopping online and picking up in our store, which we think is going to be a very important factor during the fourth quarter, but building out those capabilities, leveraging our stores as flexible fulfillment centers. As we go into this holiday season, well over 1,000 locations will be locations that not only you can shop in and pick up, but we're using to deliver the last mile. We think that's a huge competitive advantage. So we feel very good about the strategy we have in place. We think it's a strategy that will win not only in the short term but over the long term, and we look forward to seeing all of you in New York in February.

We are very pleased with the financial results we announced earlier this morning. While we have much more work to do, this quarter, we saw meaningful progress in our efforts to improve our traffic and sales as both metrics improved by about a percentage point compared with the second quarter. 
In addition, we generated much stronger-than-expected EPS performance, driven by strong signature category growth, favorable results in Back-to-School and Back-to-College season and the continued benefit of our cost-savings efforts. 
Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.04 was 22.1% higher than last year and well beyond the high end of the guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. With this outstanding third quarter performance, Target's adjusted EPS has grown more than 10% through the first 3 quarters of the year. This is particularly strong performance given that we've experienced flat comparable sales growth during this period. 
In addition, our business continues to generate very strong after-tax returns on invested capital. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, we reported a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 14.3%, excluding the onetime benefit of the gain on the sale of our pharmacy business. This performance represents an increase of approximately 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Of course, strong cash generation by our business allows us to continue to fund a healthy level of investment in our stores, supply chain and technology while funding robust cash returns to our investors. In the third quarter, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders on the form of dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've already returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. 
I'd like to pause and thank our team for their boundless energy and passion to serve our guests by offering them unique merchandise, outstanding service and a best-in-class experience. They deserve all the credit for our outstanding financial results this quarter. 
As I look ahead, I'm really excited about our holiday merchandising and marketing plans, and I'm confident that our outstanding team will bring those plans to life for our guests in our stores and digital channels throughout the holiday season. 
Our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress on many of our strategic priorities. Reflecting our work on category roles, sales in signature categories accelerated in the third quarter, out-comping the company average by more than 3 percentage points. 
Signature growth was the key driver behind healthy comp increases in both Home and Apparel, and we continue to see market share gains in these important categories. Consistent with our recent strength around events and holidays, third quarter sales in the Back-to-School, Back-to-College season were very strong, resulting in favorable gross margin mix in our sales. In addition, our gross margin rate continues to reflect the cost of goods benefit of our ongoing cost-control initiatives. 
Within our signature category results, we're seeing exceptional growth in our 2 new brands we launched earlier this year: Pillowfort in Kids Home and Cat & Jack in Kids Apparel. We developed these new brands in collaboration with both kids and their parents, and our guests continue to respond to the unique combination of style, quality and value these new brands deliver. 
We also continue to see robust growth in our digital sales. Digital sales grew more than 26% in the third quarter, and they've grown more than 20% year-to-date. This year, we have devoted both capital and expense to improve the digital experience, increase reliability and create additional capacity, and we're seeing really encouraging results. 
This quarter, we ran a promotion that, among other things, allowed us to stress test our systems in advance of the fourth quarter. This promotion was an unprecedented and compelling offer for our guests, 10% off our entire assortment in both stores and digital channel. As you'd expect, the offer drove strong traffic and sales in all channels, but our digital comp on that day was particularly high. In the face of very strong surge in traffic, I'm happy to report that our system performed very well, providing us valuable insight as we prepare for even bigger days this holiday season. 
Last year, to support our strategic investments in Target's digital capabilities, supply chain and store experience, we launched a comprehensive cost-savings effort to free up resources and create capacity, and our team has really delivered. We had an ambitious goal: to take a total of $2 billion out of Target's expenses and cost of goods over a 2-year period. Yet, as we approach the end of that 2-year period, I'm pleased that our team has actually exceeded our $2 billion goal, and importantly, the team has identified additional opportunities we'll pursue in future years. The ability to create additional capacity is critical given the sizable investments we'll continue to make as we position our business for long-term growth. 
Finally, we are really excited about the continued strong performance of our new flexible-format stores. These new locations allow us to reach new neighborhoods in dense urban and suburban markets. We opened another 5 of these stores across the country in the third quarter, including our fantastic new store in the TriBeCa neighborhood of New York City. 
When we open and operate these stores, we go beyond legacy systems and processes, customizing the assortment and operations that fit the characteristics of the individual neighborhoods in which we operate, and we continue to see phenomenal responses from our guests. Including this quarter's opening, we are now operating nearly 30 of these new-format stores. Based on their performance, we are increasingly confident in the opportunity for Target to profitably operate hundreds of urban flex-format stores over time, reaching new neighborhoods where consumers have a strong affinity for our brand. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we are continuing to address the challenges I described on our last conference call. First and foremost is traffic. And while we saw considerable improvement this quarter, we are committed to growing our comp traffic and sales over time. A key factor is our ability to deliver on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, and our signature category performance demonstrates that we continue to deliver on the Expect More side. 
However, earlier this year, we began to fall short in communicating value to support the Pay Less side both in our stores and in our marketing. In the third quarter, we began to address that imbalance by communicating our commitment to value more clearly. We believe those changes were instrumental in driving improved traffic and comp sales in the third quarter. Going forward, we are committed to striking the appropriate balance in all of our marketing communications. 
We also continue our work to improve the performance of our assortment of convenient, self-service Food in our stores. We saw another small decline in Food comp sales in the third quarter, reflecting near-term challenges presented by deflation and an intensely competitive environment. Despite these near-term challenges, we are focused on delivering stronger growth over time, and Mark will outline his team's plans in a few minutes. 
In addition, comp sales in our Electronics and Entertainment categories continue to underperform the company average. However, in the third quarter, we were encouraged to see a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products, driven by their introduction of several new product innovations. As you know, Electronics, Entertainment and Toys are key gifting categories in the fourth quarter, and the team is excited about their plans to compete and win at this critical time. 
Finally, we continue to work with CVS to drive script count growth in the pharmacies in our stores. As a result of our coordinated marketing efforts, which included our stores, our weekly ads and CVS direct communication to their PBM members, we measured an increase in consumer awareness of the transition of our stores' pharmacies to CVS, and we've seen a corresponding improvement in the script trend in these pharmacies. We continue to believe our CVS partnership will be an important traffic driver over time, and we expect to see significant improvement in 2017. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to pause and reflect on the progress and the business results through the first 3 quarters of the year. When you focus on the top line, you'll see that we've generated essentially flat comps through the first 9 months of the year. This is well below the expectation we had at the beginning of the year, and our first and highest priority is to restore growth to the traffic and sales trend. 
However, when you move to the bottom line, you'll see that we've grown adjusted earnings per share more than 10% in the first 9 months of the year. This is outstanding performance, but it's particularly noteworthy in light of the sales challenges we've been facing. The performance is a testament to the resilience of our underlying business, our strategy and, of course, our team, the best team in retail. 
Now I'd like to welcome Mark Tritton onto the call. Mark comes to us with an impressive history in retail merchandising with experience at Nike, Timberland and, most recently, Nordstrom. Mark is a merchant's merchant and a strong leader. Since he arrived at Target, I've been impressed with how quickly he's become immersed in our business and integrated into our team. We're excited to have Mark leading merchandising, and I know he's excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and beyond. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark so he can provide more details on the category performance in the third quarter and our plans to win during the holiday season and beyond. Mark?"

As Brian mentioned, I spent the last several months digging into our business, understanding Target'",1499,"Thanks, Brian, and hello, everyone. I'm so happy to be joining all of you on the call today. I look forward to meeting with you in New York this spring. 
As Brian mentioned, I spent the last several months digging into our business, understanding Target's strengths and exploring where we have the biggest opportunities to grow. And what I found is we have a strong business as it stands today, a powerful Target brand, an impressive own brand portfolio, great-looking stores, a friendly and engaged team and a huge base of passionate guests. With these strengths, we also have an amazing opportunity in front of us. It's been energizing to dig in with the team to develop merchandising's plan to drive Target's future growth. I look forward to sharing our vision in detail with you at our Financial Community Meeting. 
For today, I'm going to focus on our recent performance and our plans for this quarter and the holiday season. In the third quarter, sales performance improved across nearly every part of our business. Comp sales in Apparel and Home accelerated the most, providing a positive mix benefit on the gross margin line. Strong execution and markdown management compounded that benefit, leading to much stronger-than-expected gross margin in the quarter. 
As Brian mentioned, we saw very strong trends in Back-to-School and Back-to-College, reflecting our focus on key growth categories and the benefit of improvements we made to our promotional cadence. Digital growth played a big role in the season, particularly in Home, which is already one of our biggest and most profitable categories online. We've continued to see the fastest growth in signature categories sales. 
A few of the highlights from the third quarter include Kids, where we've seen an outstanding performance in Cat & Jack and Pillowfort. We've also continued to generate strong comps in women's ready-to-wear on top of outstanding growth in 2015, and within Home, our results were strongest in the decor and Seasonal categories. 
Given this strong growth in signature, both Home and Apparel saw low single-digit growth in comp sales this quarter, extending our record of market share gains in these strategically important categories. As Brian mentioned, in Electronics, recent product launches helped improved trends in Apple this quarter. However, we continue to see soft trends in mobile phones overall, which is what we've seen in the industry as upgrade cycles are lengthening. 
In Food and beverage, we saw another small comp sales decline this quarter. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we have an opportunity to more clearly convey and resonate value for our guests in this important category. This is being done through our end-cap presentations, enhancing our use of local pricing and making changes to our promotional cadence, and we expect to see the full benefit from these changes in the fourth quarter. 
In essentials, where we identified a similar opportunity, we've seen faster progress. As a result, comp sales grew in essentials in the third quarter, and we expect to see continued progress this quarter. 
Also, as Brian mentioned before, we've seen a meaningful improvement in script counts in the CVS pharmacies in our stores. We're also seeing higher guest services scores compared with the period prior to and particularly during the conversion of our pharmacies. These improvements show that our guests are moving beyond the temporary disruption caused by those conversions, and with the disruption behind them, they're responding to the services and capabilities that CVS can provide. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to build on our momentum from the third quarter. 
Target is a destination for season, and no season is more important than the holiday. In Home, we're looking to build on last year's success, when we saw the biggest comp growth in more than a decade. Our holiday décor assortment will feature products based on 3 key Seasonal trends: traditional, Nordic and modern. 
New this year, we've created Wondershop, a destination in our stores and on target.com that will grab guests' attention and put them in the mood to shop for the season. Wondershop features thousands of new holiday interim items. In fact, about 70% of the assortment is new this year. 
We're also bringing back to the holidays our collaboration with stationery designer Sugar Paper, which was a big hit last year. This features a limited edition collection ranging from $1.50 to up to $15. 
Holiday is an important Apparel season for families, and we're well positioned to deliver for our guests with our new Cat & Jack collection. This new brand has hit a sweet spot with millennial parents in particular, and we have high expectations for what it can deliver during the holiday season. Between October and December, we are introducing more than 1,000 new pieces to our Cat & Jack assortment. Each piece is under $30, which is unbeatable value when you consider the design and quality. 
As Brian also shared, Toys play a key role in the fourth quarter. In fact, we do about 50% of our annual toy sales during this time frame, and this year, we're building on 10 consecutive quarters of growth in Toys, reflecting our investments in newness, differentiation and collectability. This holiday season, we've added nearly 1,800 new and exclusive toys, up more than 15% from last year. 
As you recall, Target had the #1 market share in Star Wars last year. This fall, we once again led the market with launch of our Rogue One assortment, and for holiday, we're featuring more than 100 new products. Beyond Star Wars, Disney princesses continue to do very well. Elsa from Frozen remains our top seller, selling more than the other 11 princesses combined. 
An emerging trend in board games has been a bright spot for us this year as families are looking for activities that bring them together. We've seen double-digit growth in board games so far this year, and we've got 50 Target-exclusive games this season for you. 
In Electronics this quarter, we are planning for strong demand for Apple new products given that preorder volume was 3x higher than last year. We're also expecting a lot of guest interest in virtual reality, along with connected home devices like Google Home. Elevated service in our Electronics department is also important to help make shopping in this area a more enjoyable experience for our guests and drive incremental sales in our stores. So more than 1,500 stores we're transitioning from Target Mobile reps who are focused only on mobile to Target tech whose scope will include all of Electronics. 
Last year, our exclusive CD from Adele was a massive hit for the holiday season. This year, we've got a collaboration with Garth Brooks, and we expect it to be huge. Target's 10-disc box set includes Garth's new album with 2 exclusive tracks, including the much hyped 25th anniversary edition of Friends in Low Places. By the way, Target is the only place you'll ever be able to find that track. The set went on sale for $29.99 on November 11, 2 weeks before Garth's new album will be available at other retailers. 
This year in Food and beverage, about 20% of our national brand holiday assortment is exclusive to Target, and we've more than doubled our assortment of craft beers from last year, growing from about 700 to nearly 1,500 options across the country. 
In our marketing and promotion, we're coordinating everything for our guests, inspiring them with providing ease and convenience during a stressful time of the year. From the Wondershop to the Wonderlist gift guide and the kid's Wish List app, we're making it easy and fun for guests to find the right gift for everyone on their list. 
Guests loved our 10 Days of Deals last year, so we're bringing back these popular promotions on the days leading up to and following Black Friday.  Based on guest insight, we've optimized this year's cadence of deals and simplified offers to make them easy to understand. In addition, we've worked with our stores to streamline guest communication, freeing up store teams to serve our guests during the busiest time of the year. 
And finally, throughout the season, our broadcast ads will build excitement for the release of The Toycracker, our take on the classic story of The Nutcracker. We'll release this new holiday story in 2 4-minute segments during the world broadcast premiere of Frozen on December 11. Kids of all ages will not want to miss it. With all this amazing content, I hope you can see why we are so excited about our merchandise, promotion and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
However, as we all know, these plans will only come to life through the work of our operations team. So now I'm going to turn the call over to John, who will outline how his team is prepared to deliver on those plans and provide outstanding service to our guests throughout the holiday season. John?"
174438,381624164,1087803,"Target Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season. And as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we're well pos",988,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season. And as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we're well positioned to deliver great guest service and a better experience in every channel. 
In our stores, we've hired and trained tens of thousands of seasonal team members who are already serving our guests. Notably, despite the tightest labor market conditions we've seen in some time, our hiring and training process went smoothly. In fact, we met our key hiring and training milestones earlier than a year ago. 
When guests shop our stores this holiday season, in addition to great products, displays and services, they'll find our in-stock position is better than we've ever measured, reflecting improvement across every category we sell. And importantly, we're attaining those in-stock levels with lower inventory than a year ago. Over the last 18 months, we've deliberately invested in our inventory position in key commodity categories to ensure we remain in-stock in categories where reliability is most important to our guests. However, now that we've annualized these investments and we're beginning to see the benefit of our work to make our supply chain faster and more reliable, we'll be able to deliver outstanding in-stocks on a smaller base of inventory over time. 
The accuracy of our inventory data is key to our speed and reliability, and we've been investing in our systems and processes to achieve greater accuracy. One example is our implementation of RFID technology in a portion of our Apparel assortment, which is currently in more than 1,600 of our stores. In affected categories, overall inventory accuracy has increased dramatically, meaningfully reducing the number of occasions in which we can't physically locate an item. 
In addition, we've made system changes to optimize replenishment of products that our guests purchase in multiples and make changes to minimum on-hand standards in higher-volume locations, both of which have dramatically reduced out-of-stocks on affected items. We will continue to test and rollout these enhancements throughout next year. 
Because of our efforts to eliminate nonguest-facing work in our stores, the team is delivering outstanding service to our guests while delivering efficiency in support of our cost-control efforts. Through the redesign of our in-store replenishment processes and algorithms, we've reduced store backroom trips dramatically this year, delivering tens of millions of dollars of payroll savings that we've reinvested in service. 
Two areas in which we've invested store labor are the Store Pickup process and our ship-from-store capability. Guests love the flexibility of these capabilities all year but especially during the holiday season. In fact, during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, we expect our stores to fulfill more than half of our digital demand. While this is the third holiday season in which we've offered order pickup in all of our stores, we're planning for volume to grow another 50% from a year ago. 
Since last year, we've added additional holding capacity to more than 80 of our highest-volume pickup locations, and we've invested in scheduling tools and additional digital devices to enable high-volume locations to deliver fast service even in peak times. And this year, in more than 300 of our highest-volume pickup locations, our stores teams will wear unique shirts and deliver separately branded reusable bags to underscore our commitment to the pickup experience. 
By last year's holiday season, about 460 of our stores were shipping directly to our guests, up more than threefold from about 140 stores in 2014. This year, we've extended this capability to another 600 stores, meaning that well over 1,000 of our stores are shipping directly to our guests this season. In total, these stores are expected to ship more than 3x as many units as last year, accounting for about 1/3 of our digital volume during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. 
Shipping from stores delivers a number of benefits to our guests and to our business. Most importantly, this capability reduces shipping times, given the proximity of these stores to the vast majority of the U.S. population. With that proximity of guests, we also save on shipping, helping to relieve the pressure from shipping growth in our P&L. It also allows us to balance our inventory across our store network, maintaining in-stocks while reducing markdowns in store locations with heavy inventory. 
And finally, store shipping release pressure on our fulfillment centers, especially during peak season, allowing the entire network to function more effectively. Our 3 delayed allocation centers, which have all come online this year, are another way we upgraded capacity. These facilities allow us to aggregate inventory in slower-moving but harder-to-forecast categories, allowing us to improve our store allocation without hurting lead times. During peak season, we will be fully utilizing these facilities to free up space in our regional DCs to enhance the overall speed and reliability across our distribution network. 
Finally, as a result of our efforts to optimize inbound processes, we expect to double the percentage of our holiday receipts that are processed within 24 hours of arrival. This will enhance our store in-stocks while freeing up meaningful space in our regional DCs, further enhancing speed and efficiency. 
While we're just getting started, our team is really excited about our progress in modernizing Target's operations, and we're pleased to hear from many of you that you're beginning to notice the difference when you shop with us. While that's great to hear, I want to emphasize that we are not slowing down. Our team is energized and focused on our plans for the next year and beyond, and I look forward to sharing those plans with you in February. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her perspective on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?"
174438,381624164,1087803,"Target Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year and well above the top end of our g",1271,"Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year and well above the top end of our guidance range. This performance would be noteworthy in any environment but it's especially impressive given our challenging sales trends. 
Comparable sales declined 0.2% in the third quarter. This was a full percentage point better than our second quarter performance and near the high end of our guidance range. However, it's well below the growth we expect to generate over time. 
With the removal of our pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results, total sales were down nearly 7% in the quarter. Digital sales increased more than 26%, contributing about 70 basis points to our comparable sales. Digital growth was fastest in our signature categories and was particularly strong in Kids, driven by the strength of our Back-to-School offering and the launch of Cat & Jack. This is particularly exciting because signature categories are items and brands uniquely Target. 
Among the components of our comp sales, transactions were down 1.2% in the third quarter and 1 percentage point improvement from the second quarter. Average ticket increased 1%, in line with our performance so far this year. 
I want to pause here and make it clear that while we have made significant progress, we are not satisfied with our third quarter traffic and sales performance. First and foremost, we are focused on restoring growth to both of these metrics over time. Our REDcard program is our most powerful loyalty vehicle, and it's continuing to grow. Sales penetration on our REDcard was 24.3% in the third quarter, in line with our expectations and 2 percentage points ahead of last year. Excluding the benefit from the pharmacy transaction, penetration was up about 80 basis points in the quarter, which is consistent with our year-to-date performance. 
Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.9%, up from 8.6% last year. About 2/3 of this improvement was driven by an increase in our gross margin rate combined with the benefit of a lower SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our gross margin rate improved about 80 basis points compared to last year, which was much stronger than expected. This improvement was entirely driven by merchandise mix resulting from both the pharmacy transaction and strong performance in our signature categories. 
On the SG&A line, we saw about 40 basis points of improvement from a year ago, which reflects the benefit of our ongoing cost-control efforts. As John mentioned, we continue to find ways to eliminate nonguest-facing labor in our stores. This creates capacity that allows our team to focus on guest service while maintaining outstanding efficiencies to support our financial performance. 
For the first time this year, our quarter-end inventory was lower than a year ago. The team has done a fantastic job responding to the recent slowdown in our sales by effectively managing inventory and receipt. With this strong execution, we've seen outstanding gross margin performance so far this year. And as we enter the peak of the holiday season, we feel very good about the level and the composition of our inventory. 
Let's turn now to capital deployment. We paid $345 million in dividends during the third quarter and returned another $878 million through share repurchase. A portion of our third quarter repurchase activity was accomplished through an accelerated share repurchase agreement. A portion of this ASR was settled after the end of the quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares, which keeps us on track to invest $3.5 billion or more in share repurchase this year. 
One thing to note is that during the third quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll begin repurchasing shares under this new program when we complete the current $10 billion program. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $300 million of remaining capacity on the current $10 billion program. 
And one other item to note. During the third quarter, we obtained a new $2.5 billion credit facility that expires in October of 2021. This new facility replaces a $2.25 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in 2018. We have never borrowed under any of our prior credit facilities, and we would not expect to borrow under the new one either. However, it provides an important source of backup liquidity, and it serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program, which we use to fund our seasonal borrowing needs. 
Reflecting our focus on disciplined capital deployment, one of our goals is to grow our after-tax return on invested capital into the mid-teens over time. I'm pleased to share that we are making significant progress toward this goal. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 16.3%. However, that calculation includes the onetime gain from the pharmacy sale, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding that gain, our third quarter after-tax ROIC was 14.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Consistent with last quarter, we are maintaining a cautious outlook, given the current environment and the prospect of a very competitive holiday season. With that in mind, we are planning our fourth quarter comparable sales to be roughly consistent with our third quarter performance in a range of around flat, plus or minus 1%. Total sales are expected to decline about 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. This will be the last quarter in which we will be comping over pharmacy and clinic sales from the prior year. 
In terms of operating margin, we're expecting our fourth quarter segment EBIT margin rate will be up slightly, about 10 basis points higher than last year. This outlook is based on an expected 40 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin rate, driven entirely by a lower SG&A expense rate. Offsetting this improvement, we expect to see an increase of about 30 basis points in our depreciation and amortization expense rate. This will be driven by approximately $15 million of accelerated depreciation related to our 2017 store remodel program, along with the deleveraging effects of the total sales decline resulting from the pharmacy transaction. 
Altogether, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.75. When we combine these fourth quarter expectations with our year-to-date performance, we're expecting to generate approximately flat comparable sales for the full year and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.30. Notably, the top half of this updated EPS range is within the range we laid out at the beginning of the year. This demonstrates how effectively our team has performed in the face of unexpected sales challenges. 
Looking into next year, our first focus is to restore growth in our traffic and comparable sales. With sales growth, a strong gross margin mix and continued cost discipline, we believe we can sustainably grow both the top line and the bottom line over time. I look forward to discussing our longer-term aspirations and our outlook for 2017 performance at our meeting with you in February. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who has a few closing remarks. Brian?"

Before we open up for questions, I want to pause and recap our position as we enter the final quarter of the year. Year-to-date, comp sales have been about flat, and we believe it's prudent to plan for a similar trend in the fourth quarter. That said, we're very excited about our plans for the holiday season, and our team is focused on outperforming our plans, gaining market share and delivering positive comp sales across our businesses, not just in signature categories. 
On the adjusted EPS line, we have grown more than 10% so far this year. And based on our fourth quarter expectations, our updated range for full year adjusted EPS overlaps with the original guidance range we provided last March, reflecting the team's strong execution in the face of challenging sales trends. 
Signature categories sales continue to far outpace the company average, and we continue to gain market share in these categories. And because our digital growth continues to outpace the industry average, we continue to gain share in the digital channel as well. 
So while we continue to adjust our near-term tactics to better maintain the balance on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, we believe we have the right long-term strategic plan to sustain Target's performance over time. 
I look forward to covering both our fourth quarter results and our longer-term strategic and financial plans at our Financial Community Meeting, which we'll be hosting in New York on February 28.

And every time we open up a new store, whether it's in New York, TriBeCa or Philadelphia, we're seeing a great response from our guests. And we've been on a journey, over the last couple of years, to drive greater efficiency throughout our organization. And with John's leadership, we continue to see very strong improvement in operational efficiencies and costs that we're returning to the bottom line. So our focus over the third quarter is very similar to the journey we've been on for the last couple of years, and we've just intensified our focus on executing against our key strategic plan -- planks."

So Brian, if you could take us out and kind of talk about the strategy to drive traffic, get the sales up. I think you threw the number out there, 3% comp growth '17 and beyond.

So we think the importance of the in-store experience, great customer service, continuing to bring newness to our assortment, elevating and developing our own brands -- I think one of the big highlights for Target in 2016 is the way our guest has reacted to 2 great new brands. Both Pillowfort and Cat & Jack have been incredibly well received. The style, the quality, the value we're delivering is connecting with our guest. So the combination of great in-store experience, making sure we surround our guest with great customer service, whether they're shopping in our store or they've ordered online and they're coming in to pick up that order, and then delivering great Target brands at a value. So we think that combination is the strategy that drives traffic into our stores, cars into our parking lot and even more engagement online."

Pay Less. So this is a continuing trend. And then the spaces between the key seasonal events that you raised, as Brian said, we're hyper-focused on that. We've seen some strength in some of our options that we put in place and really looking forward to our plans about how do we continue guest traffic and love post major events where we do win."

But the important part of the year is in front of us, and I think we're very well positioned. And from a script standpoint, we are still rebuilding some momentum in that space. But sequentially, we've seen improvement from Q1 to Q2 and Q3, and we recognize that with time, as the branding's in place, as our in-store marketing and the CVS marketing take shape, we're going to be rebuilding and growing scripts in that very important part of our store."

From a fill-in and stock-up standpoint, again, the work that Mark just talked about on the value side is clearly addressing the fill-in guest, and I feel very good about the progress we've made and will continue to make in that space. I think to the broader question, it's a terrific way for us to wrap up before we all get together in New York City. We continue to feel very good about the strategy we have in place and how that will allow us to be very competitive and continue to win in the current retail environment. We think the investments we're making in our stores are critically important, and that store experience that we continue to elevate is a very important measure for our guests. We've learned, as I hope you have, guests still like physical stores, and year-to-date, still almost 90% of all retail shopping is taking place in a physical store. So we've got to make sure we've got a great experience, we've got great service, we continue to elevate that experience and service and combine it with outstanding merchandise and value every time our guests shop. We think our strategy of moving into new neighborhoods, whether it's these densely populated urban centers or on college campuses, is a critical growth vehicle. And again, the reaction we've seen every time we open up a store in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and certainly in New York tells us our guests love the convenience of having Target right there in their neighborhood. But we're also continuing to make investments online, and we want to make sure we continue to give our guests the choice of shopping any way they want, the ease of shopping online and picking up in our store, which we think is going to be a very important factor during the fourth quarter, but building out those capabilities, leveraging our stores as flexible fulfillment centers. As we go into this holiday season, well over 1,000 locations will be locations that not only you can shop in and pick up, but we're using to deliver the last mile. We think that's a huge competitive advantage. So we feel very good about the strategy we have in place. We think it's a strategy that will win not only in the short term but over the long term, and we look forward to seeing all of you in New York in February. 
So with that, operator, we're going to wrap up our third quarter call. I appreciate everyone participating, and we look forward to seeing you in New York in February."

We are very pleased with the financial results we announced earlier this morning. While we have much more work to do, this quarter, we saw meaningful progress in our efforts to improve our traffic and sales as both metrics improved by about a percentage point compared with the second quarter. 
In addition, we generated much stronger-than-expected EPS performance, driven by strong signature category growth, favorable results in Back-to-School and Back-to-College season and the continued benefit of our cost-savings efforts. 
Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.04 was 22.1% higher than last year and well beyond the high end of the guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. With this outstanding third quarter performance, Target's adjusted EPS has grown more than 10% through the first 3 quarters of the year. This is particularly strong performance given that we've experienced flat comparable sales growth during this period. 
In addition, our business continues to generate very strong after-tax returns on invested capital. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, we reported a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 14.3%, excluding the onetime benefit of the gain on the sale of our pharmacy business. This performance represents an increase of approximately 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Of course, strong cash generation by our business allows us to continue to fund a healthy level of investment in our stores, supply chain and technology while funding robust cash returns to our investors. In the third quarter, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders on the form of dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've already returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. 
I'd like to pause and thank our team for their boundless energy and passion to serve our guests by offering them unique merchandise, outstanding service and a best-in-class experience. They deserve all the credit for our outstanding financial results this quarter. 
As I look ahead, I'm really excited about our holiday merchandising and marketing plans, and I'm confident that our outstanding team will bring those plans to life for our guests in our stores and digital channels throughout the holiday season. 
Our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress on many of our strategic priorities. Reflecting our work on category roles, sales in signature categories accelerated in the third quarter, out-comping the company average by more than 3 percentage points. 
Signature growth was the key driver behind healthy comp increases in both Home and Apparel, and we continue to see market share gains in these important categories. Consistent with our recent strength around events and holidays, third quarter sales in the Back-to-School, Back-to-College season were very strong, resulting in favorable gross margin mix in our sales. In addition, our gross margin rate continues to reflect the cost of goods benefit of our ongoing cost-control initiatives. 
Within our signature category results, we're seeing exceptional growth in our 2 new brands we launched earlier this year: Pillowfort in Kids Home and Cat & Jack in Kids Apparel. We developed these new brands in collaboration with both kids and their parents, and our guests continue to respond to the unique combination of style, quality and value these new brands deliver. 
We also continue to see robust growth in our digital sales. Digital sales grew more than 26% in the third quarter, and they've grown more than 20% year-to-date. This year, we have devoted both capital and expense to improve the digital experience, increase reliability and create additional capacity, and we're seeing really encouraging results. 
This quarter, we ran a promotion that, among other things, allowed us to stress test our systems in advance of the fourth quarter. This promotion was an unprecedented and compelling offer for our guests, 10% off our entire assortment in both stores and digital channel. As you'd expect, the offer drove strong traffic and sales in all channels, but our digital comp on that day was particularly high. In the face of very strong surge in traffic, I'm happy to report that our system performed very well, providing us valuable insight as we prepare for even bigger days this holiday season. 
Last year, to support our strategic investments in Target's digital capabilities, supply chain and store experience, we launched a comprehensive cost-savings effort to free up resources and create capacity, and our team has really delivered. We had an ambitious goal: to take a total of $2 billion out of Target's expenses and cost of goods over a 2-year period. Yet, as we approach the end of that 2-year period, I'm pleased that our team has actually exceeded our $2 billion goal, and importantly, the team has identified additional opportunities we'll pursue in future years. The ability to create additional capacity is critical given the sizable investments we'll continue to make as we position our business for long-term growth. 
Finally, we are really excited about the continued strong performance of our new flexible-format stores. These new locations allow us to reach new neighborhoods in dense urban and suburban markets. We opened another 5 of these stores across the country in the third quarter, including our fantastic new store in the TriBeCa neighborhood of New York City. 
When we open and operate these stores, we go beyond legacy systems and processes, customizing the assortment and operations that fit the characteristics of the individual neighborhoods in which we operate, and we continue to see phenomenal responses from our guests. Including this quarter's opening, we are now operating nearly 30 of these new-format stores. Based on their performance, we are increasingly confident in the opportunity for Target to profitably operate hundreds of urban flex-format stores over time, reaching new neighborhoods where consumers have a strong affinity for our brand. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we are continuing to address the challenges I described on our last conference call. First and foremost is traffic. And while we saw considerable improvement this quarter, we are committed to growing our comp traffic and sales over time. A key factor is our ability to deliver on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, and our signature category performance demonstrates that we continue to deliver on the Expect More side. 
However, earlier this year, we began to fall short in communicating value to support the Pay Less side both in our stores and in our marketing. In the third quarter, we began to address that imbalance by communicating our commitment to value more clearly. We believe those changes were instrumental in driving improved traffic and comp sales in the third quarter. Going forward, we are committed to striking the appropriate balance in all of our marketing communications. 
We also continue our work to improve the performance of our assortment of convenient, self-service Food in our stores. We saw another small decline in Food comp sales in the third quarter, reflecting near-term challenges presented by deflation and an intensely competitive environment. Despite these near-term challenges, we are focused on delivering stronger growth over time, and Mark will outline his team's plans in a few minutes. 
In addition, comp sales in our Electronics and Entertainment categories continue to underperform the company average. However, in the third quarter, we were encouraged to see a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products, driven by their introduction of several new product innovations. As you know, Electronics, Entertainment and Toys are key gifting categories in the fourth quarter, and the team is excited about their plans to compete and win at this critical time. 
Finally, we continue to work with CVS to drive script count growth in the pharmacies in our stores. As a result of our coordinated marketing efforts, which included our stores, our weekly ads and CVS direct communication to their PBM members, we measured an increase in consumer awareness of the transition of our stores' pharmacies to CVS, and we've seen a corresponding improvement in the script trend in these pharmacies. We continue to believe our CVS partnership will be an important traffic driver over time, and we expect to see significant improvement in 2017. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to pause and reflect on the progress and the business results through the first 3 quarters of the year. When you focus on the top line, you'll see that we've generated essentially flat comps through the first 9 months of the year. This is well below the expectation we had at the beginning of the year, and our first and highest priority is to restore growth to the traffic and sales trend. 
However, when you move to the bottom line, you'll see that we've grown adjusted earnings per share more than 10% in the first 9 months of the year. This is outstanding performance, but it's particularly noteworthy in light of the sales challenges we've been facing. The performance is a testament to the resilience of our underlying business, our strategy and, of course, our team, the best team in retail. 
Now I'd like to welcome Mark Tritton onto the call. Mark comes to us with an impressive history in retail merchandising with experience at Nike, Timberland and, most recently, Nordstrom. Mark is a merchant's merchant and a strong leader. Since he arrived at Target, I've been impressed with how quickly he's become immersed in our business and integrated into our team. We're excited to have Mark leading merchandising, and I know he's excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and beyond. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark so he can provide more details on the category performance in the third quarter and our plans to win during the holiday season and beyond. Mark?"

I'm so happy to be joining all of you on the call today. I look forward to meeting with you in New York this spring. 
As Brian mentioned, I spent the last several months digging into our business, understanding Target's strengths and exploring where we have the biggest opportunities to grow. And what I found is we have a strong business as it stands today, a powerful Target brand, an impressive own brand portfolio, great-looking stores, a friendly and engaged team and a huge base of passionate guests. With these strengths, we also have an amazing opportunity in front of us. It's been energizing to dig in with the team to develop merchandising's plan to drive Target's future growth. I look forward to sharing our vision in detail with you at our Financial Community Meeting. 
For today, I'm going to focus on our recent performance and our plans for this quarter and the holiday season. In the third quarter, sales performance improved across nearly every part of our business. Comp sales in Apparel and Home accelerated the most, providing a positive mix benefit on the gross margin line. Strong execution and markdown management compounded that benefit, leading to much stronger-than-expected gross margin in the quarter. 
As Brian mentioned, we saw very strong trends in Back-to-School and Back-to-College, reflecting our focus on key growth categories and the benefit of improvements we made to our promotional cadence. Digital growth played a big role in the season, particularly in Home, which is already one of our biggest and most profitable categories online. We've continued to see the fastest growth in signature categories sales. 
A few of the highlights from the third quarter include Kids, where we've seen an outstanding performance in Cat & Jack and Pillowfort. We've also continued to generate strong comps in women's ready-to-wear on top of outstanding growth in 2015, and within Home, our results were strongest in the decor and Seasonal categories. 
Given this strong growth in signature, both Home and Apparel saw low single-digit growth in comp sales this quarter, extending our record of market share gains in these strategically important categories. As Brian mentioned, in Electronics, recent product launches helped improved trends in Apple this quarter. However, we continue to see soft trends in mobile phones overall, which is what we've seen in the industry as upgrade cycles are lengthening. 
In Food and beverage, we saw another small comp sales decline this quarter. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we have an opportunity to more clearly convey and resonate value for our guests in this important category. This is being done through our end-cap presentations, enhancing our use of local pricing and making changes to our promotional cadence, and we expect to see the full benefit from these changes in the fourth quarter. 
In essentials, where we identified a similar opportunity, we've seen faster progress. As a result, comp sales grew in essentials in the third quarter, and we expect to see continued progress this quarter. 
Also, as Brian mentioned before, we've seen a meaningful improvement in script counts in the CVS pharmacies in our stores. We're also seeing higher guest services scores compared with the period prior to and particularly during the conversion of our pharmacies. These improvements show that our guests are moving beyond the temporary disruption caused by those conversions, and with the disruption behind them, they're responding to the services and capabilities that CVS can provide. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to build on our momentum from the third quarter. 
Target is a destination for season, and no season is more important than the holiday. In Home, we're looking to build on last year's success, when we saw the biggest comp growth in more than a decade. Our holiday décor assortment will feature products based on 3 key Seasonal trends: traditional, Nordic and modern. 
New this year, we've created Wondershop, a destination in our stores and on target.com that will grab guests' attention and put them in the mood to shop for the season. Wondershop features thousands of new holiday interim items. In fact, about 70% of the assortment is new this year. 
We're also bringing back to the holidays our collaboration with stationery designer Sugar Paper, which was a big hit last year. This features a limited edition collection ranging from $1.50 to up to $15. 
Holiday is an important Apparel season for families, and we're well positioned to deliver for our guests with our new Cat & Jack collection. This new brand has hit a sweet spot with millennial parents in particular, and we have high expectations for what it can deliver during the holiday season. Between October and December, we are introducing more than 1,000 new pieces to our Cat & Jack assortment. Each piece is under $30, which is unbeatable value when you consider the design and quality. 
As Brian also shared, Toys play a key role in the fourth quarter. In fact, we do about 50% of our annual toy sales during this time frame, and this year, we're building on 10 consecutive quarters of growth in Toys, reflecting our investments in newness, differentiation and collectability. This holiday season, we've added nearly 1,800 new and exclusive toys, up more than 15% from last year. 
As you recall, Target had the #1 market share in Star Wars last year. This fall, we once again led the market with launch of our Rogue One assortment, and for holiday, we're featuring more than 100 new products. Beyond Star Wars, Disney princesses continue to do very well. Elsa from Frozen remains our top seller, selling more than the other 11 princesses combined. 
An emerging trend in board games has been a bright spot for us this year as families are looking for activities that bring them together. We've seen double-digit growth in board games so far this year, and we've got 50 Target-exclusive games this season for you. 
In Electronics this quarter, we are planning for strong demand for Apple new products given that preorder volume was 3x higher than last year. We're also expecting a lot of guest interest in virtual reality, along with connected home devices like Google Home. Elevated service in our Electronics department is also important to help make shopping in this area a more enjoyable experience for our guests and drive incremental sales in our stores. So more than 1,500 stores we're transitioning from Target Mobile reps who are focused only on mobile to Target tech whose scope will include all of Electronics. 
Last year, our exclusive CD from Adele was a massive hit for the holiday season. This year, we've got a collaboration with Garth Brooks, and we expect it to be huge. Target's 10-disc box set includes Garth's new album with 2 exclusive tracks, including the much hyped 25th anniversary edition of Friends in Low Places. By the way, Target is the only place you'll ever be able to find that track. The set went on sale for $29.99 on November 11, 2 weeks before Garth's new album will be available at other retailers. 
This year in Food and beverage, about 20% of our national brand holiday assortment is exclusive to Target, and we've more than doubled our assortment of craft beers from last year, growing from about 700 to nearly 1,500 options across the country. 
In our marketing and promotion, we're coordinating everything for our guests, inspiring them with providing ease and convenience during a stressful time of the year. From the Wondershop to the Wonderlist gift guide and the kid's Wish List app, we're making it easy and fun for guests to find the right gift for everyone on their list. 
Guests loved our 10 Days of Deals last year, so we're bringing back these popular promotions on the days leading up to and following Black Friday. Based on guest insight, we've optimized this year's cadence of deals and simplified offers to make them easy to understand. In addition, we've worked with our stores to streamline guest communication, freeing up store teams to serve our guests during the busiest time of the year. 
And finally, throughout the season, our broadcast ads will build excitement for the release of The Toycracker, our take on the classic story of The Nutcracker. We'll release this new holiday story in 2 4-minute segments during the world broadcast premiere of Frozen on December 11. Kids of all ages will not want to miss it. With all this amazing content, I hope you can see why we are so excited about our merchandise, promotion and marketing plans for the holiday season. 
However, as we all know, these plans will only come to life through the work of our operations team. So now I'm going to turn the call over to John, who will outline how his team is prepared to deliver on those plans and provide outstanding service to our guests throughout the holiday season. John?"

Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season.

Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season. And as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we're well positioned to deliver great guest service and a better experience in every channel. 
In our stores, we've hired and trained tens of thousands of seasonal team members who are already serving our guests. Notably, despite the tightest labor market conditions we've seen in some time, our hiring and training process went smoothly. In fact, we met our key hiring and training milestones earlier than a year ago. 
When guests shop our stores this holiday season, in addition to great products, displays and services, they'll find our in-stock position is better than we've ever measured, reflecting improvement across every category we sell. And importantly, we're attaining those in-stock levels with lower inventory than a year ago. Over the last 18 months, we've deliberately invested in our inventory position in key commodity categories to ensure we remain in-stock in categories where reliability is most important to our guests. However, now that we've annualized these investments and we're beginning to see the benefit of our work to make our supply chain faster and more reliable, we'll be able to deliver outstanding in-stocks on a smaller base of inventory over time. 
The accuracy of our inventory data is key to our speed and reliability, and we've been investing in our systems and processes to achieve greater accuracy. One example is our implementation of RFID technology in a portion of our Apparel assortment, which is currently in more than 1,600 of our stores. In affected categories, overall inventory accuracy has increased dramatically, meaningfully reducing the number of occasions in which we can't physically locate an item. 
In addition, we've made system changes to optimize replenishment of products that our guests purchase in multiples and make changes to minimum on-hand standards in higher-volume locations, both of which have dramatically reduced out-of-stocks on affected items. We will continue to test and rollout these enhancements throughout next year. 
Because of our efforts to eliminate nonguest-facing work in our stores, the team is delivering outstanding service to our guests while delivering efficiency in support of our cost-control efforts. Through the redesign of our in-store replenishment processes and algorithms, we've reduced store backroom trips dramatically this year, delivering tens of millions of dollars of payroll savings that we've reinvested in service. 
Two areas in which we've invested store labor are the Store Pickup process and our ship-from-store capability. Guests love the flexibility of these capabilities all year but especially during the holiday season. In fact, during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, we expect our stores to fulfill more than half of our digital demand. While this is the third holiday season in which we've offered order pickup in all of our stores, we're planning for volume to grow another 50% from a year ago. 
Since last year, we've added additional holding capacity to more than 80 of our highest-volume pickup locations, and we've invested in scheduling tools and additional digital devices to enable high-volume locations to deliver fast service even in peak times. And this year, in more than 300 of our highest-volume pickup locations, our stores teams will wear unique shirts and deliver separately branded reusable bags to underscore our commitment to the pickup experience. 
By last year's holiday season, about 460 of our stores were shipping directly to our guests, up more than threefold from about 140 stores in 2014. This year, we've extended this capability to another 600 stores, meaning that well over 1,000 of our stores are shipping directly to our guests this season. In total, these stores are expected to ship more than 3x as many units as last year, accounting for about 1/3 of our digital volume during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. 
Shipping from stores delivers a number of benefits to our guests and to our business. Most importantly, this capability reduces shipping times, given the proximity of these stores to the vast majority of the U.S. population. With that proximity of guests, we also save on shipping, helping to relieve the pressure from shipping growth in our P&L. It also allows us to balance our inventory across our store network, maintaining in-stocks while reducing markdowns in store locations with heavy inventory. 
And finally, store shipping release pressure on our fulfillment centers, especially during peak season, allowing the entire network to function more effectively. Our 3 delayed allocation centers, which have all come online this year, are another way we upgraded capacity. These facilities allow us to aggregate inventory in slower-moving but harder-to-forecast categories, allowing us to improve our store allocation without hurting lead times. During peak season, we will be fully utilizing these facilities to free up space in our regional DCs to enhance the overall speed and reliability across our distribution network. 
Finally, as a result of our efforts to optimize inbound processes, we expect to double the percentage of our holiday receipts that are processed within 24 hours of arrival. This will enhance our store in-stocks while freeing up meaningful space in our regional DCs, further enhancing speed and efficiency. 
While we're just getting started, our team is really excited about our progress in modernizing Target's operations, and we're pleased to hear from many of you that you're beginning to notice the difference when you shop with us. While that's great to hear, I want to emphasize that we are not slowing down. Our team is energized and focused on our plans for the next year and beyond, and I look forward to sharing those plans with you in February. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will share her perspective on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?"
174438,381624164,1088053,"Target Corp., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year and well above the top end of our g",1271,"Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year and well above the top end of our guidance range. This performance would be noteworthy in any environment but it's especially impressive given our challenging sales trends. 
Comparable sales declined 0.2% in the third quarter. This was a full percentage point better than our second quarter performance and near the high end of our guidance range. However, it's well below the growth we expect to generate over time. 
With the removal of our pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results, total sales were down nearly 7% in the quarter. Digital sales increased more than 26%, contributing about 70 basis points to our comparable sales. Digital growth was fastest in our signature categories and was particularly strong in Kids, driven by the strength of our Back-to-School offering and the launch of Cat & Jack. This is particularly exciting because signature categories are items and brands uniquely Target. 
Among the components of our comp sales, transactions were down 1.2% in the third quarter and 1 percentage point improvement from the second quarter. Average ticket increased 1%, in line with our performance so far this year. 
I want to pause here and make it clear that while we have made significant progress, we are not satisfied with our third quarter traffic and sales performance. First and foremost, we are focused on restoring growth to both of these metrics over time. Our REDcard program is our most powerful loyalty vehicle, and it's continuing to grow. Sales penetration on our REDcard was 24.3% in the third quarter, in line with our expectations and 2 percentage points ahead of last year. Excluding the benefit from the pharmacy transaction, penetration was up about 80 basis points in the quarter, which is consistent with our year-to-date performance. 
Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.9%, up from 8.6% last year. About 2/3 of this improvement was driven by an increase in our gross margin rate combined with the benefit of a lower SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our gross margin rate improved about 80 basis points compared to last year, which was much stronger than expected. This improvement was entirely driven by merchandise mix resulting from both the pharmacy transaction and strong performance in our signature categories. 
On the SG&A line, we saw about 40 basis points of improvement from a year ago, which reflects the benefit of our ongoing cost-control efforts. As John mentioned, we continue to find ways to eliminate nonguest-facing labor in our stores. This creates capacity that allows our team to focus on guest service while maintaining outstanding efficiencies to support our financial performance. 
For the first time this year, our quarter-end inventory was lower than a year ago. The team has done a fantastic job responding to the recent slowdown in our sales by effectively managing inventory and receipt. With this strong execution, we've seen outstanding gross margin performance so far this year. And as we enter the peak of the holiday season, we feel very good about the level and the composition of our inventory. 
Let's turn now to capital deployment. We paid $345 million in dividends during the third quarter and returned another $878 million through share repurchase. A portion of our third quarter repurchase activity was accomplished through an accelerated share repurchase agreement. A portion of this ASR was settled after the end of the quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares, which keeps us on track to invest $3.5 billion or more in share repurchase this year. 
One thing to note is that during the third quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll begin repurchasing shares under this new program when we complete the current $10 billion program. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $300 million of remaining capacity on the current $10 billion program. 
And one other item to note. During the third quarter, we obtained a new $2.5 billion credit facility that expires in October of 2021. This new facility replaces a $2.25 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in 2018. We have never borrowed under any of our prior credit facilities, and we would not expect to borrow under the new one either. However, it provides an important source of backup liquidity, and it serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program, which we use to fund our seasonal borrowing needs. 
Reflecting our focus on disciplined capital deployment, one of our goals is to grow our after-tax return on invested capital into the mid-teens over time. I'm pleased to share that we are making significant progress toward this goal. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 16.3%. However, that calculation includes the onetime gain from the pharmacy sale, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding that gain, our third quarter after-tax ROIC was 14.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Consistent with last quarter, we are maintaining a cautious outlook, given the current environment and the prospect of a very competitive holiday season. With that in mind, we are planning our fourth quarter comparable sales to be roughly consistent with our third quarter performance in a range of around flat, plus or minus 1%. Total sales are expected to decline about 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. This will be the last quarter in which we will be comping over pharmacy and clinic sales from the prior year. 
In terms of operating margin, we're expecting our fourth quarter segment EBIT margin rate will be up slightly, about 10 basis points higher than last year. This outlook is based on an expected 40 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin rate, driven entirely by a lower SG&A expense rate. Offsetting this improvement, we expect to see an increase of about 30 basis points in our depreciation and amortization expense rate. This will be driven by approximately $15 million of accelerated depreciation related to our 2017 store remodel program, along with the deleveraging effects of the total sales decline resulting from the pharmacy transaction. 
Altogether, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.75. When we combine these fourth quarter expectations with our year-to-date performance, we're expecting to generate approximately flat comparable sales for the full year and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.30. Notably, the top half of this updated EPS range is within the range we laid out at the beginning of the year. This demonstrates how effectively our team has performed in the face of unexpected sales challenges. 
Looking into next year, our first focus is to restore growth in our traffic and comparable sales. With sales growth, a strong gross margin mix and continued cost discipline, we believe we can sustainably grow both the top line and the bottom line over time. I look forward to discussing our longer-term aspirations and our outlook for 2017 performance at our meeting with you in February. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian, who has a few closing remarks. Brian?"

Before we open up for questions, I want to pause and recap our position as we enter the final quarter of the year. Year-to-date, comp sales have been about flat, and we believe it's prudent to plan for a similar trend in the fourth quarter. That said, we're very excited about our plans for the holiday season, and our team is focused on outperforming our plans, gaining market share and delivering positive comp sales across our businesses, not just in signature categories. 
On the adjusted EPS line, we have grown more than 10% so far this year. And based on our fourth quarter expectations, our updated range for full year adjusted EPS overlaps with the original guidance range we provided last March, reflecting the team's strong execution in the face of challenging sales trends. 
Signature categories sales continue to far outpace the company average, and we continue to gain market share in these categories. And because our digital growth continues to outpace the industry average, we continue to gain share in the digital channel as well. 
So while we continue to adjust our near-term tactics to better maintain the balance on both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise, we believe we have the right long-term strategic plan to sustain Target's performance over time. 
I look forward to covering both our fourth quarter results and our longer-term strategic and financial plans at our Financial Community Meeting, which we'll be hosting in New York on February 28. We'll be providing more details on timing and location soon. But in the meantime, please mark your calendars for that date. 
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Cathy, Mark, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions."

And we think the combination of the investments we've made to improve ease, functionality of our digital engagement and the fact that we're certainly showing the ability to win during key holiday and thematic periods, that's the right balance for us going forward. So we think digital is going to be an important part of our growth strategy going forward. We think digital is certainly the way our guest interfaces with the brand, whether they're in store or online.

And then, more important than that, digitally, ensuring we have the right unit at the right place for the guest, whether they want to come in store and pick it up, whether we're going to ship that from a store or ship that from a fulfillment center. And today, we're not completely optimized there either. And so while we've seen great progress and we -- there's absolutely benefit to the guest and their trust with us when they come into the store over time, we still think there's a lot of runway there for us to improve.

I think to the broader question, it's a terrific way for us to wrap up before we all get together in New York City. We continue to feel very good about the strategy we have in place and how that will allow us to be very competitive and continue to win in the current retail environment. We think the investments we're making in our stores are critically important, and that store experience that we continue to elevate is a very important measure for our guests. We've learned, as I hope you have, guests still like physical stores, and year-to-date, still almost 90% of all retail shopping is taking place in a physical store. So we've got to make sure we've got a great experience, we've got great service, we continue to elevate that experience and service and combine it with outstanding merchandise and value every time our guests shop. We think our strategy of moving into new neighborhoods, whether it's these densely populated urban centers or on college campuses, is a critical growth vehicle. And again, the reaction we've seen every time we open up a store in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and certainly in New York tells us our guests love the convenience of having Target right there in their neighborhood. But we're also continuing to make investments online, and we want to make sure we continue to give our guests the choice of shopping any way they want, the ease of shopping online and picking up in our store, which we think is going to be a very important factor during the fourth quarter, but building out those capabilities, leveraging our stores as flexible fulfillment centers. As we go into this holiday season, well over 1,000 locations will be locations that not only you can shop in and pick up, but we're using to deliver the last mile. We think that's a huge competitive advantage. So we feel very good about the strategy we have in place. We think it's a strategy that will win not only in the short term but over the long term, and we look forward to seeing all of you in New York in February.
