Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the presentation that was posted at our Investor portal earlier today and for the sake of brevity, I'll start on Page 3 that highlights of our fourth quart",3652,"Great, Don. Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the presentation that was posted at our Investor portal earlier today and for the sake of brevity, I'll start on Page 3 that highlights of our fourth quarter results. 
I think as you saw, we have exceeded the guidance we gave for our revenue guidance. We achieved record fourth quarter segment margins. We generated $742 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $228 million of our own shares. We think of a very strong quarter in the midst of a pretty choppy end markets. And I think it concludes the year on a strong basis. 
So if we flip to the second chart, just a couple of the highlights in terms of the reconciliation to the midpoint of the guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter, you recall the midpoint of our guidance was $1.10. Our volume came in just slightly higher than that what we had guided to, you recall that we guided organic sales being down 3% from the third quarter actuals, actually came in at 2%. Our -- the net of our restructuring costs and our savings came in at about $0.02 better. We had all the savings and more that we were looking for. We actually got it done at a little bit less cost. 
Our tax rate did come in a little bit lower, about $0.02, the 3.9% versus the roughly 5.5% we had guided to. And then our corporate expenses are reflecting that same orientation, tried really getting our structural cost down that you saw also manifest itself in our very strong segment performance contributed $0.02. So $0.07 [ph] deep for the quarter, a nice way to finish up the year. 
If we turn to Page 5. Just the overall financial numbers, I'm sure you had an opportunity to study these. I would just reference one number in particular here because it does tie in to the lot to our thinking relative to having increased our restructuring over the next couple of years, is the organic growth number, which you see in the green box at the lower left of the chart, down some 4%. It was down 3% last year, so -- our last quarter, the third quarter. So again, if you think through the year last year, we actually started up with a first quarter that was slightly up and then the second, third and fourth quarter, we've seen our markets weaken. 
Just a quick run through the individual segments. And I will get onto the guidance for '16, which I think is what most of you are most interested in getting some additional color around. Let's start with the electrical products segment, that's on Page 6. As you can see, organic growth of down 1% percent. It was actually flat in the third quarter. You can see very strong margin performance, 17.7%; volume relationship to last year, down 5%. And obviously, you see 4x was 4 points of that. 
Looking in the bookings. Bookings were down 1%. And it's interesting, as you look around the world, quite different conditions by region. Americas were flattish. Europe was up nicely and the Asia Pacific, both in this segment as well as in our systems and services electric segment, down fairly higher. And we think that reflects the real weakness that's been going on in China. We'll talk a little bit more about that as we go on in the call. 
Our net restructuring, if you'll see is a slight positive to the quarter. A good solid quarter. And as you get down within the individual areas clearly, we're continuing to see strengthen in our lighting products, residential continues to be strong in the U.S. Canada is weak. Middle East was quite strong, which was one of the things that helps Europe. And across Asia Pacific, whether it be on -- in China or whether it be in some of the electronic products we supply as well, a weaker quarter. 
If we flip to Page 7, Electrical Systems & Services segment. We think a good quarter performance, a nice rebound from the third quarter. If you look at the margins, up 13.9%. So one of the stronger quarters we've had this year in this segment. This story is much the same however, in terms of the markets. If you look at the box in the lower left-hand corner, again the organic sales down 5%. It was down 5% last quarter as well. And the bookings being down 2%. The play out is fairly similar that the real weak region was Asia Pacific once again. 
As we have talked over the last couple of years, we of course, see that the bookings over the last couple of quarters are a fairly good predictor of revenue levels in the next several quarters. And so if you look back to the third quarter of 2015, our bookings were down some 3%. Now they're down 2%, I think that'll help you understand our thinking relative to markets when we talk about that in organic growth for 2016. 
If we move to the next page, Page 8, our Hydraulics segment. Very strong margin performance here as well in spite of a very weak market conditions. You may recall that in the third quarter, we reported organic sales down 10%. Here in the fourth quarter, down 12%. Our bookings, down 22% and that's pretty much a worldwide story. I mean if you go around, whether it be the Americas or EMEA or Asia Pacific, the numbers are all negative. And they're negative also when we look at both the distributer and the OEM cuts. 
So these markets continue to be very weak. I think our team has done a really terrific job in terms of really containing costs and driving structural change, and that's why you see, we think stronger than most people expected margins in the segment of 11.2%. 
If we move to Chart 9, the Aerospace segment. Great quarter for aerospace business. It continued to have a really very, very strong margins. Our bookings were up 6% and we're particularly pleased in the aftermarket, which you know is an area that we've been working hard to continue to bolster. It was up both on the commercial and the military side for an average about [ph] 14%. 
A lot of discussion over the last couple of weeks about what's happening in the commercial aerospace activity. We'll talk a little bit more about that when we talk about our guidance for next year, but we continue to see that outlook being strong as we move into 2016 and '17. 
And if we move to Chart 10, our Vehicle segment, really strong quarter performance from a margin perspective again. I know a number of you have had concerns and as this business begins to turn dow, it would have a disproportionate impact upon our margins. I think you see here in the fourth quarter, our operating plans and a great job our teams have been doing to get structural costs out, is really having a positive impact, not only here in the fourth quarter, but once again, in our guidance for next year. 
And after Class 8 shipments impact were down in the fourth quarter. They were down 6%. And -- but you see that the really strong 18.4% margins here in the quarter. As we look into next year, we'll talk a little bit more about it in just a moment, but our forecast is that we'll see the nap to heavy-duty market be on the order of 250,000 units. That's down about 23% from this year, so that is fully incorporated in our planning for next year. 
If we move to Chart 11, maybe just to kind of cap off 2015. We obviously, saw organic growth to be negative throughout this year. But the fact that we moved in the second quarter to start to really drive structural -- cost structure across the company is why you're seeing the real benefits here in the fourth quarter and that obviously, sets up a really important part of our operating plan for 2016. 
Segment margins were 15.2%. Free cash flow was slightly below our target of 100% as we look at this year. We did repurchase a 2.4% of our shares outstanding, that's about $682 million we spent on that during this year. We paid down $1 billion of debt this year. And we have completed the Cooper integration and so really, as we enter into this next year, you'll see we virtually have no acquisition integration costs anticipated during this -- during 2016 as well. 
2012 are really just for your records, really gives you the kind of breakout of how our restructuring plan laid out during 2015. And as I mentioned up front, our net benefits in the fourth quarter were better than we had laid out for you earlier. And I think reflect the momentum we have within our overall restructuring program. 
2000 -- Page 13, titled 2015 Restructuring Costs And Benefit, really give you a view of that full-year activity more for your historical background as you think of our performance across the segments. I'm going to jump to Chart 14 as we start to talk about our thoughts for 2016. 
With the weaker markets that we had anticipated in October, you may recall those numbers, I'll go back over for them for you in a moment in the subsequent charge. We've now accelerated and in fact, expanded our restructuring actions. And it's our view that a couple of you had commented on in your writeups this morning that 2016 and 2017 will remain somewhat challenged time periods in terms of end market growth. And so our focus is getting the cost out and using our balance sheet to buy back shares and to really get the company well-positioned in what will be a period of lower growth than we had seen in previous years. 
So what you see in that chart up top, we tried to laid out for your ease here is that our 2015 actuals than our '16 and '17 cost and the incremental benefits occurring each year, that's incremental to the previous year and you can see the total. The big news here is that we've expanded the program to a three-year program. We're going to spend about $400 million. We'll get benefits just over $400 million over this time period. 
And as you think about 2016 because I know that's of real interest to you, we'll spend about $70 million of that $140 million in the first quarter of this year. About 50% of the balance, so the balance of the $70 million will be spent in the second quarter. And then during the third and fourth quarter, the spending is fairly equal. The benefits however, not much of those incremental benefits of $185 million occur in the first quarter because we're just kicking off this second phase of actions and it builds through the balance of the year. 
So it is a reasonable expectation that it has a bigger contribution to operating earnings per share in the third and fourth quarter than it would have in the second quarter. If we jump to Chart 15. And I mentioned before that our view of our markets and organic growth opportunities are lower than they were when we last discussed this in October. You'll recall that we hadn't laid out a formal forecast, but we shared with you some early thoughts on 2016 and in our October earnings conference call. 
At that time, we talked about organic revenues being down on the order of 1% to 2%. We now -- with the benefit of the last several months and I think all econ news, not only we, but you also have been reading as well as our detailed discussions with our customers around the world, we think a better expectation tuned up for all that data is that our organic revenues will decline in the order of 2% to 4%. 
As you go through these individual segments, let me just give you a sense for what has changed. As you can see, on our rate on the chart, our organic revenue growth projections for the individual 5 segments we report. For Electrical Products, we think the organic growth will be in the range of 0% to 2%. In Electrical Systems & Services, a negative 2% to negative 4%. In October, we had said if you put those 2 together, we thought the growth would be about 1%. 
In the hydraulics area, we're now forecasting organic growth of negative 9% to negative 11%. In October, we had said we thought it would be about negative 7%. In aerospace, we're seeing 1% to 3%. Not that much has changed. We thought it would be 3%. And in vehicle, we had thought it would be negative 7% -- excuse me, we had thought it would be negative 5% in October. We now think it'll be 7% to 9%. 
So what are the big drivers here? Let me start from the bottom where I ended with vehicle. We now think the North American heavy-duty market will decline to about 250,000 units. That's the whole market for NAFTA, down 23% from where we finished up from 320,000 units in 2015. We think the light vehicle markets in the U.S. are going to remain strong, kind of flat to 1% up. We think China will continue to move along fairly well in terms of its light vehicle markets. 
We think Europe, we're in agreement with most of the consensus that's out there, that it's probably up on the of something like 2%. And we continue to feel that Latin America is a very troubled area and really when we talk about the vehicle market, we're talking really about Brazil. And so those numbers will be down 10% to 15% this year. That's what brings us to our 7% to 9%. Within the hydraulics market, I'd say, really a continuation of the negative expectations in terms of the worldwide ag equipment market and the construction equipment markets and not much positive on the industrial side. 
And I'd say again, 9% to 11% of that best approximation having talked to our customers and you see many of them release their own guidance for 2016. We think this is very much in line with our own projections. If we move to Chart 16, titled Segment Operating Margin Expectations. I think it's really noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, we increased our operating margins in spite of negative organic growth, and that is indeed exactly our plan again in 2016. In spite of about $1 billion volume decline and again, that's about $600 million in organic growth and about $400 million from 4x, we expect to expand our segment margins. It finished at 15.2% last year. And as you can see, the midpoint of our guidance is 15.6%, so about a 40 basis point expansion. 
We can obviously, talk about each one of these as we build your questions. But I will call your attention to vehicle because I know many of you are concerned in terms of looking at the year 2016, is that we would see a several hundred point contraction in vehicle margins as the overall market place began to decline. As you can see, we're confident with our operating plan and the benefit, and all the restructuring we're doing, a fine job has been doing our team there, that we're going to hold very attractive margins in that segment. And I think that's really a key element in terms of thinking about the valuation of Eaton because this is one that you'd be concerned historically from a volatility point of view. 
If we turn to Chart 17, labeled our Multi-year Share Purchase Program. You'll recall in July, we laid out our new capital plan, which outlined on an annual basis, repurchasing 1% to 2% of our outstanding shares per year. We paid off this last year, as I mentioned, about $1 billion of debt. We repurchased $682 million or about 2.4% of our outstanding shares. And we have commented through the fall that in this period of time when we're seeing such weakness in equity pricing and specifically our own, that we were tilting our balanced plan that we've had in spending about 50% on the share repurchase and about 50% on acquisitions that we were tilting at toward buying buyback more of our share. We're announcing today obviously, is that we're targeting a $3 billion share repurchase program. 
And those are for the years 2015 through '18. And so what that means for us to having purchased back obviously 682 million last year, this is about $2.3 billion of purchases over these next 3 years, about 10% of our outstanding shares. That does move us a little closer to sort of an annual buyback that's in the order of more like 2.5% versus 1.5%. 
Now specifically in terms of 2016, you'll recall that I just mentioned the number in 2015, we bought back 682 million. We would expect to buyback about that same level this year, roughly $700 million. It will, as it normally is for us, be back-end loaded in terms of how our cash flow lays out through the year. But it does play an important part in terms of how we offset a slightly higher tax rate. And I'll talk about that in just a moment. 
You'll recall at year-end was 2015, our share count was 460 4 million shares. And so we'll leave it to you to kind of figure out back, and loaded, buying back about whether that'll pull our full shares, but it's -- we think it's worth around about $0.09, a positive impact. 
So if we move to Chart 18 to kind of pull this altogether in terms of our EPS guidance for 2016, let's start with the first quarter. Our operating and fully diluted EPS this year is the same because we don't have acquisition integration costs this year. We think our organic revenue compared to the fourth quarter, so the actual numbers we just reported will come down about 5%. For those of you who are already calculating, that means it's down about 8% from last year in the first quarter. The tax rate will be between 8% to 10%. And the segment margin, including the restructuring cost of the $70 million will be somewhere between 13.5% and 14%. That's what supports our $0.80 to $0.90 operating and fully diluted guidance for the first quarter. 
In terms of the full year. Again, no acquisition that [indiscernible] so $4.15 to $4.45 with the midpoint obviously, $4.30 the guidance does include the full net restructuring benefit that we outlined for you, that's on the previous charts, $174 million that's a year-to-year benefit from our restructuring and the $45 mil from the Cooper integration savings, which is primarily the full year benefit of the plant closings that we were concluding in the back half of last year. 
So the operating EPS, and I think this is really the best way to think about our operating plan. We'll have flat operating EPS year-to-year. We'll actually be up 2% in terms of fully diluted because we don't have acquisition integration charges. But that flat operating EPS year-to-year really incorporates having revenues down $1 billion, $600 million of organic, $400 million of FX, margins up 40 basis points driven by all the restructuring work that we got a good head start on by starting early in 2015. 
And then the share repurchase of approximately $700 million are basically an offset the impact of what we anticipate is going to be an increase of the tax rate from roughly 8% last year to roughly 10% as the midpoint of our range this year. 
So if we turn to Page 19. Just to recap again, organic revenue down 2% to 4%. You recall we had a couple of very small acquisitions, so we had a little positive in terms of $35 million in terms of additional revenue. 2% negative 4x, that's, that $400 million top line impact that I mentioned negative. Operating margins that was the 40 basis point expansion from last year. Corporate expenses continuing to reflect all of the work that we're doing to get our cost down not only in our operating units, but across the corporation as well. Tax rate ticking up slightly from last year. I just mentioned the flat operating earnings -- operating EPS and the 2% increase in net income per share. Operating cash flow, $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Free cash flow, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Obviously, that looks like it's been a cash conversion ratio of greater than 1, and yes, that's exactly what we're targeting and then CapEx of about $525 million. 
And I can understand some of you may have a question, gee, that's pretty similar to what you spent last year. Volumes are coming down. Why are you spending as much CapEx? We do have some capital that is involved in all these restructuring actions and that's really the difference to facilitate getting them done in areas where we may be closing and consolidating facilities. 
So that's our outlook for '16. We think it's a tight plan. We obviously, have, have the benefit of looking very hard at these markets and we're really confident about the restructuring plan that we put together. So that restructuring plan and our share buyback, very much in our own control and those are the kind of variables we're trying to control as we move into it into 2016. 
Don with that, I'll turn things back to you for questions."

Nonres, is probably the hardest 1 of all those numbers to figure out particularly here in the U.S. There's so many difficult opinions on non-res. We think much of it have been publicist, perhaps a little too bullish, we're more on the 3% to 5%, I know there's some people that are at 8%, gosh, I hope they're right. But that's not what we're basing our expectations on. Utility's are a little better than we've seen it in the last couple of years, but it's still kind of a 0% to 2%. Industrial is quite troubled still in terms of just not seeing a lot going, so that's probably 0% to a negative number. As you get into harsh and hazardous applications that have large portions of oil and gas around them, those are numbers that are like negative 15% type numbers. And then when we look in the large power quality areas, I'd say those markets are likely to be slightly negative again this next year. Last comment I would say is that we just don't see the big large industrial construction numbers that are being so hauntedly reported in many government statistics. We're out there bidding on them all and we aren't seeing what they're talking about. So that's our view as to how we look. We don't see Asia Pacific getting substantially stronger. We think still that's going to be weakened up by the lack of the big projects there. EMEA is coming back and I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw a pretty good tone there. And so again, we're a very low single digit. But it's better than a negative."

We're trying to get this business sized, so that it can perform well without having to have any market rebound. Because again, we think that we are in a commodity cycle.

Most recently, anything tied to capital purchases and on the industrial side of the business. And so when we take a look at kind of the end markets that we serve instead of our hydraulics period. But for the Great Recession, over the last 15 years, we've never seen a period like this in hydraulics business. And to Sandy's point, you have a business that in this environment that can still standup, clearly margin are on the company average. But margins that are 10% to 11%, we think is pretty remarkable performance from that business. And at some point, these markets will turn. And whether or not that's end of '16, '17, but we're -- to Sandy's point, we're putting together a plan today that says, we're going to make sure that this business delivers attractive margins at this level of economic activity. And when it turns, it'll throw up very handsome incremental profit. And so today clearly we're living in a hydraulics space that we don't like it any more than you do.

I mean, the hydraulic, clearly the point Craig just made our distributors have been dealing with this for a long period of time. I think the 1 segment where you find when you travel regionally and you talked to different customers if an individual distributor whether they were electrical or whether they were hydraulic had a unusually high exposure to the oil and gas area, they may still be struggling with some inventories.

Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the presentation that was posted at our Investor portal earlier today, and for the sake of brevity, I'll start right on Page 3, the highlights of our fourt",3676,"Great, Don. Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the presentation that was posted at our Investor portal earlier today, and for the sake of brevity, I'll start right on Page 3, the highlights of our fourth quarter results. 
I think as you saw, we have exceeded the guidance we gave for our revenue guidance. We achieved record fourth quarter segment margins. We generated $742 million in operating cash flow, and we repurchased $228 million of our own shares. We think a very strong quarter in the midst of pretty choppy end markets, and I think it concludes the year on a strong basis. 
So if we flip to the second chart, just a couple of the highlights in terms of the reconciliation to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter, you recall the midpoint of our guidance was $1.10. Our volume came in just slightly higher than we had guided to. You recall that we had guided organic sales being down 3% from the third quarter actuals, actually came in at 2%. Our -- the net of our restructuring costs and our savings came in at about $0.02 better. We got all the savings and more that we were looking for. We actually got it done at a little bit less cost. 
Our tax rate did come in a little bit lower, about $0.02, so the 3.9% versus the roughly 5.5% we had guided to. And then our corporate expenses are reflecting that same orientation. We tried really getting our structural cost down, that you saw also manifest itself in our very strong segment performance, contributed $0.02. So a $0.07 beat for the quarter, a nice way to finish up the year. 
If we turn to Page 5. Just the overall financial numbers, I'm sure you've had an opportunity to study these. I would just reference one number in particular here because it does tie in to -- a lot to our thinking relative to having increased our restructuring over the next couple of years, is the organic growth number, which you see in the green box, the lower left of the chart, down some 4%. It was down 3% last year, so -- our last quarter, the third quarter. So again, as you think through the year last year, we actually started up with a first quarter that was slightly up and then the second, third and fourth quarter, we've seen our markets weaken. 
Just a quick run through the individual segments, then we'll get on to the guidance for '16, which I think is what most of you are most interested in trying to get some additional color around. Let's start with the Electrical Products segment. That's on Page 6. As you can see, organic growth, down 1%. It was actually flat in the third quarter. You can see very strong margin performance, 17.7%; volume relationship to last year, down 5%. And obviously, you see forex was 4 points of that. 
Looking in the bookings. Bookings were down 1%. And it's interesting, as you look around the world, quite different conditions by region. Americas were flattish. Europe was up nicely. And Asia Pacific, both in this segment as well as in our Systems & Services Electrical segment, down fairly higher. And we think that reflects the real weakness that's been going on in China. We'll talk a little bit more about that as we go on in the call. 
Net restructuring is you'll see a slight positive to the quarter. A good solid quarter, and as you get down within the individual areas, clearly, we're continuing to see it strengthen in our lighting products. Residential continues to be strong here in the U.S. Canada is weak. Middle East was quite strong, which was one of the things that helped Europe. And across Asia Pacific, whether it be on -- in China or whether it be in some of the electronic products we supply as well, a weaker quarter. 
If we flip to Page 7, Electrical Systems & Services segment, we think a good quarter performance, a nice rebound from the third quarter. If you look at the margins, up 13.9%. So one of the stronger quarters we've had this year in this segment. The story is much the same, however, in terms of the markets. If you look at the box on the lower left-hand corner again, the organic sales, down 5%. It was down 5% last quarter as well. And the bookings being down 2%. The play-out is fairly similar that the real weak region was Asia Pacific once again. 
As we have talked over the last couple of years, we, of course, see that the bookings over the last couple of quarters are a fairly good predictor of revenue levels in the next several quarters. And so if you look back to the third quarter of 2015, our bookings were down some 3%. Now they're down 2%, and I think that will help you understand our thinking relative to markets when we talk about that in organic growth for 2016. 
If we move to the next page, Page 8, our Hydraulics segment, very strong margin performance here as well in spite of very weak market conditions. You may recall that in the third quarter, we reported organic sales, down 10%. Here in the fourth quarter, they're down 12%. Our bookings, down 22%, and that's pretty much a worldwide story. I mean, if you go around, whether it be the Americas or EMEA or Asia Pacific, the numbers are all negative. And they're negative also when we look at both the distributor and the OEM cut. 
So these markets continue to be very weak. And I think our team has done a really terrific job in terms of really containing costs and driving structural change, and that's why you see, we think, stronger than most people expected margins in the segment of 11.2%. 
If we move to the -- Chart 9, the Aerospace segment, a great quarter for aerospace business. They continued having really very, very strong margins. Our bookings were up 6%, and we're particularly pleased in the aftermarket, which is an area that we've been working hard to continue to bolster. It was up both on the commercial and the military side for an average of about 14%. 
A lot of discussion over the last couple of weeks about what's happening in the commercial aerospace activity. We'll talk a little bit more about that when we talk about our guidance for next year, but we continue to see that outlook being strong as we move into 2016 and '17. 
And if we move to Chart 10, our Vehicle segment, a really strong quarter performance from a margin perspective again. And I know a number of you have had concerns, and as this business begins to turn down, that it would have a disproportionate impact upon our margins. I think you see here in the fourth quarter our operating plans and the great job our teams have been doing in getting structural costs out is really having a positive impact, not only here on the fourth quarter but once again, in our guidance for next year. 
The NAFTA Class 8 shipments impact were down in the fourth quarter. They were down 6%. And -- but you see that the really strong 18.4% margins here in the quarter. As we look into next year, we'll talk a little bit more about it in just a moment, but our forecast is that we'll see the NAFTA heavy-duty market be on the order of 250,000 units. That's down about 23% from this year, so that is fully incorporated in our planning for next year. 
If we move to Chart 11, maybe just to kind of cap off 2015, we obviously saw organic growth to be negative throughout this year. But the fact that we moved in the second quarter to start to really drive structural cost reduction across the company is why you're seeing the real benefits here in the fourth quarter, and that obviously sets up a really important part of our operating plan for 2016. 
Segment margins were 15.2%. Free cash flow, slightly below our target of 100% as we look at this year. We did repurchase 2.4% of our shares outstanding. That's about $682 million we spent on that during this year. We paid down $1 billion of debt this year. And we have completed the Cooper integration and so really, as we enter into this next year, we're -- you'll see we virtually have no acquisition integration costs anticipated during this -- during 2016 as well. 
Page 12, really just for your records, really gives you the kind of breakout of how our restructuring plan laid out during 2015. And as I mentioned upfront, our net benefits in the fourth quarter were better than we had laid out for you earlier and I think reflect the momentum we have within our overall restructuring program. 
2000 -- Page 13, titled 2015 Restructuring Costs And Benefits, really give you a view of that full year activity more for your historical background as you think of our performance across the segments. 
I'm now going to jump to Chart 14 as we start to talk about our thoughts about 2016. With the weaker markets that we had anticipated in October, you may recall those numbers, I'll go back over them for you in just a moment on a subsequent chart, we've now accelerated and in fact expanded our restructuring actions. And it's our view that a couple of you had to comment on it on your writeups this morning, that 2016 and 2017 will remain somewhat challenged time periods in terms of end-market growth. And so our focus is getting the cost out and using our balance sheet to buy back shares and to really get the company well positioned in what will be a period of lower growth than we had seen in previous years. 
So what you see in that chart up top we've tried to laid out for your ease here is that our 2015 actuals, then our '16 and '17 cost and then the incremental benefits that are occurring each year that's incremental to the previous year. Then you can see the total. The big news here is that we've expanded the program to a 3-year program. We're going to spend about $400 million. We'll get benefits of just over $400 million over this time period. 
And as you think about 2016, because I know that's of a real interest to you, we'll spend about $70 million of that $140 million in the first quarter of this year. About 50% of the balance, so of the balance of the $70 million, will be spent in the second quarter. And then during the third and fourth quarter, the spending is fairly equal. The benefits, however, not much of those incremental benefits of $185 million occur in the first quarter because we're just kicking off this second phase of actions, and it builds through the balance of the year. So it is a reasonable expectation that it has a bigger contribution to operating earnings per share in the third and fourth quarter than it would have in the second quarter. 
If we jump to Chart 15. And I mentioned before that our view of our markets and organic growth opportunities are lower than they were when we last discussed this in October. You recall that we hadn't laid out a formal forecast, but we shared with you some early thoughts on 2016 in our October earnings conference call. And at that time, we talked about organic revenues being down on the order of 1% to 2%. We now, with the benefit of the last several months and I think all the economic news, that not only we but you also have been reading, as well as our detailed discussions with our customers around the world, we think a better expectation tuned up for all that data is that our organic revenues would decline on the order of 2% to 4%. 
As you go through these individual segments, let me just give you a sense for what has changed. As you can see, a rate on the chart, are our organic revenue growth projections for the individual 5 segments we report. For Electrical Products, we think the organic growth will be in the range of 0% to 2%. In Electrical Systems & Services, a negative 2% to negative 4%. In October, we had said, if you put those 2 together, we thought the growth would be about 1%. 
In the Hydraulics area, we're now forecasting organic growth of negative 9% to negative 11%. In October, we had said, we thought it would be about negative 7%. In Aerospace, we're seeing 1% to 3%. Not that much has changed. We thought it would be 3%. And in Vehicle, we had thought it would be negative 7% -- or excuse me, we had thought it would be negative 5% in October. We now think it will be 7% to 9%. 
So what are the big drivers here? Let me start from the bottom, where I ended with Vehicle. We now think the North American heavy-duty market will decline to about 250,000 units. That's the whole market for NAFTA, down 23% from where we finished up just over 320,000 units in 2015. We think the light vehicle markets in the U.S. are going to remain strong, kind of flat to 1% up. We think China will continue to move along fairly well in terms of its light vehicle markets. We think Europe, we're in agreement with most of the consensus that's out there, that it's probably up on the order of something like 2%. And we continue to feel that Latin America is a very troubled area, and really, when we talk about the vehicle market, we're talking really about Brazil. And so those numbers will be down 10% to 15% this year. That's what brings us to our 7% to 9%. Within the Hydraulics market, I'd say, really a continuation of the negative expectations in terms of the worldwide ag equipment market and the construction equipment market and not much positive on the industrial side. And I'd say, again, 9% to 11% is our best approximation, having talked to our customers, and you've seen many of them release their own guidance for 2016. We think this is very much in line with our own projections. 
If we move to Chart 16, titled Segment Operating Margin Expectations, I think it's really noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, we increased our operating margins in spite of negative organic growth, and that is indeed exactly our plan again in 2016. In spite of about $1 billion volume decline, and again, that's about $600 million in organic growth and about $400 million from forex, we expect to expand our segment margins. They finished at 15.2% last year. And as you can see, the midpoint of our guidance is 15.6%, so about a 40 basis-point expansion. 
We can obviously talk about each of these as we field your questions. But I would call your attention to Vehicle because I know many of you are concerned in terms of looking at the year of 2016, is that we would see a several hundred-point contraction in Vehicle margins as the overall marketplace began to decline. As you can see, we're confident with our operating plan and the benefit of all the restructuring we're doing, and a fine job has been done our team there, that we're going to hold very attractive margins in that segment. And I think it's really a key element in terms of thinking about the valuation of Eaton because this is one that you'd be concerned about historically from a volatility point of view. 
If we turn to Chart 17, labeled our Multi-Year Share Repurchase Program, you'll recall in July, we laid out our new capital plan, which outlined, on an annual basis, repurchasing 1% to 2% of our outstanding shares per year. We paid off, just last year, as I mentioned, about $1 billion of debt. We repurchased $682 million or about 2.4% of our outstanding shares. And we have commented through the fall that in this period of time, when we're seeing such weakness in equity pricing and specifically our own, that we were tilting our balanced plan that we've had, in spending about 50% on the share repurchase and about 50% on acquisitions, that we were tilting it toward buying back more of our shares. What we're announcing today, obviously, is that we're targeting a $3 billion share repurchase program, and those are for the years 2015 through '18. And so what that means with us, to having purchased back obviously $682 million last year, is this is about $2.3 billion of purchases over these next 3 years, about 10% of our outstanding shares. That does move us a little closer to sort of an annual buyback that's on the order of more like 2.5% versus 1.5%. 
Now specifically in terms of 2016, you'll recall that I just mentioned the number in 2015, we bought back $682 million. We would expect to buy back about that same level this year, roughly $700 million. It will, as it normally is for us, be back-end loaded in terms of how our cash flow lays out through the year. But it does play an important part in terms of how we offset a slightly higher tax rate. And I'll talk about that in just a moment. 
You'll recall at year-end of 2015, our share count was 460.4 million shares. And so we'll leave it to you to kind of figure out back-end loaded, buying back, about whether that will pull our full shares, but it's -- we think it's worth around about $0.09 of positive impact. 
So if we move to Chart 18 to kind of pull this altogether in terms of our EPS guidance for 2016, let's start with the first quarter. Our operating and fully diluted EPS this year is the same because we don't have acquisition integration costs this year. We think our organic revenue compared to the fourth quarter, so the actual numbers we just reported, will come down about 5%. For those of you who are already calculating, that means it's down about 8% from last year in the first quarter. The tax rate will be between 8% to 10%. And the segment margin, including the restructuring cost of the $70 million, will be somewhere between 13.5% and 14%. That's what supports our $0.80 to $0.90 operating and fully diluted guidance for the first quarter. 
In terms of the full year, again, no acquisition integration costs. So the $4.15 to $4.45, with a midpoint of, obviously, $4.30, the guidance does include the full net restructuring benefit that we outlined for you, that's on the previous charts, of $174 million, that's a year-to-year benefit from our restructuring, and the $45 million from the Cooper integration savings, which is primarily the full year benefit of the plant closings that we were concluding in the back half of last year. So the operating EPS, and I think this is really the best way to think about our operating plan, we'll have flat operating EPS year-to-year. We'll actually be up 2% in terms of fully diluted because we don't have acquisition integration charges. But that flat operating EPS year-to-year really incorporates having revenues down $1 billion, $600 million of organic, $400 million of FX, margins up 40 basis points, driven by all the restructuring work that we got a good head start on by starting early in 2015, and then the share repurchases of approximately $700 million are basically going to offset the impact of what we anticipate is going to be an increase in the tax rate from roughly 8% last year to roughly 10% as the midpoint of our range this year. 
So if we turn to Page 19, just to recap again. Organic revenue, down 2% to 4%. You'll recall we had a couple of very small acquisitions, so we got a little positive in terms of $35 million in terms of additional revenue. 2% negative forex, that's that $400 million top line impact that I mentioned negative. Operating margins, that was the 40 basis-point expansion from last year. Corporate expenses, continuing to reflect all of the work that we're doing to get our cost down, not only in our operating units but across the corporation as well. Tax rate ticking up slightly from last year. I just mentioned the flat operating earnings -- operating EPS and the 2% increase in net income per share. Operating cash flow, $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Free cash flow, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Obviously, that looks like it had been as a cash conversion ratio of greater than 1, and yes, that's exactly what we're targeting. And then CapEx of about $525 million. 
And I can understand, some of you may have a question, ""Gee, that's pretty similar to what you spent last year if your volumes are coming down. Why are you spending as much CapEx?"" We do have some capital that is involved in all these restructuring actions, and that's really the difference, to facilitate getting them done in areas where we may be closing and consolidating facilities. 
So that's our outlook for '16. We think it's a tight plan. We obviously have had the benefit of looking very hard at these markets, and we're really confident about the restructuring plan that we put together. And so that restructuring plan and our share buyback, very much in our own control, and those are the kind of variables we're trying to control as we move into it into 2016. 
Don, with that, I'll turn things back to you for questions."

Hard to forecast right now, Scott, whether that turn up is in '17 or whether that turn up is in '18. I think most forecasts have always proved to be wrong. But I think that the benefit of where we are right now, we're in the second year of this fairly deep commodity cycle. And as we pointed out in our earnings release, this is really only the second time that we have seen our end markets be negative in 2 consecutive years going in and we got to go all the way back to the 2000, 2001 time period.

We're sort of looking at the residential market in the U.S. as being one that will continue to be a positive on the order of, say, 3% to 4% next year. Nonres is probably the hardest one of all those numbers to figure out, particularly here in the U.S. There are so many different opinions on nonres. We think much of what's been published is perhaps a little too bullish. We're more in the 3% to 5%. I know there's some people that are at 8%. Gosh, I hope they're right. But that's not what we're basing our expectations on. Utilities are a little better than we've seen it in the last couple of years, but it's still kind of a 0% to 2%. Industrial is quite troubled still in terms of just not seeing a lot going, so that's probably a 0% to a negative number. As you get into harsh and hazardous applications that have large portions of oil and gas around them, those are numbers that are like negative 15% type numbers. And then when we look in the large power quality areas, I'd say those markets are likely to be slightly negative again this next year. The last comment I would say is that we just don't see the big large industrial construction numbers that are being so vauntedly reported in many of the government's statistics. We're out there bidding on them all and we aren't seeing what they're talking about. So that's our view as to how we look. We don't see Asia Pacific getting substantially stronger. We think still that's going to be weakened up by the lack of the big projects there. EMEA is coming back, and I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw a pretty good tone there. And so -- and again, we're a very low single digit, but it's better than a negative."

So what I'd be interested in is really your thought process about -- and maybe Craig could even add to this. Hydraulic, strategically, I mean, and I guess if we had, had this perspective that the world was going to be this difficult, we may not have built these businesses or some of the M&A we did kind of more recently. But -- and Sandy, you've made the comment that you can't really adjust your portfolio in terms of spins, right, I guess, until what, 2017, because of Cooper.

We have indicated that we do have the strategic flexibility, that if we decide to, we can sell businesses on a taxable basis just as we did the 2 Aerospace businesses that Craig led last year that we felt we could better step out of because they weren't strategically advantaged. Yes, there's no question on Hydraulics. We're dealing with very difficult end markets. We commented on that last year. We don't think that's going to change this year. We actually think the margin performance is pretty commendable in light of where the volumes have been. But we understand it's not at the sort of mid-teen levels right now that we would like to see it at. We do think, with the actions that the team is undertaking, that as we get into the latter part of this year, you're going to see some far more attractive margins than you'll see in the early part of this year because we're taking some very, very significant steps within that business. We're trying to get this business sized so that it can perform well without having to have a market rebound. Because again, we think we are in a commodity cycle, and clearly, we don't have the benefit of the revenues that we had a number of years ago when we were at the high point. And Craig, you want to add anything to that?"

And you can't find the hydraulic end market today that hasn't gone through a pretty precipitous downturn, whether it's ag or it's China construction, or it's mining, oil and gas, most recently, anything tied to capital purchases and on the industrial side of the business. And so when we take a look at kind of the end markets that we serve inside of our Hydraulics period, but for the Great Recession, over the last 15 years, we've never seen a period like this in the Hydraulics business. And to Sandy's point, to have a business that in this environment that can still stand up, clearly, margins aren't at the company average, but margins that are 10% to 11%, we think, is a pretty remarkable performance from that business. And at some point, these markets will turn, whether or not that's end of '16, '17, but we're -- to Sandy's point, we're putting together a plan today that says we're going to make sure that this business delivers attractive margins at this level of economic activity, and when it turns, it will throw up very handsome incremental profits. And so today, clearly, we're living in a period in the hydraulics space that we don't like it any more than you do. We're doing what we think we need to do, but we think this will be a very attractive business when markets turn, and they will turn."

And the Hydraulics side, clearly, the point Craig just made, our distributors have been dealing with this for a prolonged period of time. I think the one segment where you find, when you travel regionally and you talk to different customers, if an individual distributor, whether they were electrical or whether they were hydraulic, had a unusually high exposure to the oil and gas area, they may still be struggling with some inventories. Because I think that has continued to move in a way that many people didn't predict it would. But I'd say outside of that, I think they're fairly balanced.

So yes, each of the margins should build and very distinctly in Hydraulics, back to Craig's position, you'll start to see how this plan manifests itself. I think the real big takeaway from yours and many other people's questions is that we're not counting on an economic rebound to drive our plan nor our earnings. What we're counting on is the things that we can control. And that's the very important change that we made at the second quarter last year when we announced that we were going to drive very significant restructuring, and that we've now added another year to that, but then we also announced an enlarged buyback.

There is a big bucket around facilities, our manufacturing footprint around the world and distribution centers and offices.

And we think that continues for the next several years or so. There's another bucket that really gets to what we call support costs, the number of management layers that we have and the span of control of our leaders, the size of our corporate infrastructure. And that's a whole and other element of activity, that we've done a lot to improve it in 2015, and we think that also plays out continually in '16 and perhaps a little bit into '17 as well. And then there's a third bucket that I put in the category, of really optimizing where you do what you do, and that's really moving more of our activities to low-cost centers. And that's -- we're opening up shared service centers in low-cost countries and putting various activity that we do today by simply putting them in places where we can do it for much lower costs and in many cases, more efficiently.

We do think that we're in this frustratingly slow environment that can often cause people to use the recession word. But I think that's almost more of a kind of an emotional issue than it is a -- the factual basis. We think that GDP is likely to grow in the mid-2s again this year. However, if you're on the industrial side of the economy, we're seeing industrial production numbers that are more like 1. So that all that we've been -- I'm just repeating what we've probably all read is, that there has been more action on the kind of the consumer and services side than there has been on the industrial side. And that's what's been leading to the lack of capital investment for this MRO kind of industrial malaise, and that's clearly been affecting ours and many of our peers' markets. So I think I would say that's more of the tone. And you compare the U.S. growth to around the world, it's not significantly different than the total global GDP, so there, our country's slower and faster. But that's how we'd see it. We just think this is -- it's a time when it's really critical that companies get their cost base adjusted, that they don't assume that economic growth is going to bail them out, and to control those things that they can control. And that's exactly what our plan is all about, but it's not based on and nor do we think it's a high probability that there's a recession."

Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the presentation that was posted at our Investor portal earlier today, and for the sake of brevity, I'll start right on Page 3, the highlights of our fourth quarter results. 
I think as you saw, we exceeded the guidance we gave for our revenue guidance. We achieved record fourth quarter segment margins. We generated $742 million in operating cash flow, and we repurchased $228 million of our own shares. We think a very strong quarter in the midst of pretty choppy end markets, and I think it concludes the year on a strong basis. 
If we flip to the second chart, just a couple of the highlights in terms of the reconciliation to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter, you recall the midpoint of our guidance was $1.10. Our volume came in just slightly higher than we had guided to. You recall that we had guided organic sales being down 3% from the third quarter actuals; they actually came in at 2%. Our -- the net of our restructuring costs and our savings came in about $0.02 better. We got all the savings and more that we were looking for, and we actually got it done at a little bit less cost. 
Our tax rate did come in a little bit lower, about $0.02, it's the 3.9% versus the roughly 5.5% we had guided to. And then our corporate expenses reflecting that same orientation. We tried really getting our structural costs down, that you saw also manifest itself in our very strong segment performance, contributed $0.02. So a $0.07 beat for the quarter, a nice way to finish up the year. 
If we turn to Page 5. Just the overall financial numbers. I'm sure you've had an opportunity to study these. I would just reference one number in particular here, because it does tie in to -- a lot to our thinking relative to having increased our restructuring over the next couple of years, is the organic growth number, which you see in the green box, the lower left of the chart, down some 4%. It was down 3% last year, so -- or last quarter, the third quarter. So again, as you think through the year last year, we actually started out with a first quarter that was slightly up and then the second, third and fourth quarter, we've seen our markets weaken. 
Just a quick run through the individual segments, and then we'll get on to the guidance for '16, which I think is what most of you are most interested in trying to get some additional color around. Let's start with the Electrical Products segment. That's on Page 6. As you can see, organic growth of down 1%. It was actually flat in the third quarter. You can see very strong margin performance, 17.7%; volume relationship to last year, down 5%. And obviously, you see forex was 4 points of that. 
Looking at the bookings. Bookings were down 1%. And it's interesting, as you look around the world, quite different conditions by region. The Americas were flattish. Europe was up nicely. And Asia Pacific, both in this segment as well as in our Systems & Services Electrical segment, down fairly hard. And we think that reflects the real weakness that's been going on in China. We'll talk a little bit more about that as we go on in the call. 
Net restructuring, as you see, a slight positive to the quarter. A good solid quarter, and as you get down within the individual areas, clearly, we're continuing to see strengthening in our lighting products. Residential continues to be strong here in the U.S. Canada is weak. Middle East it was quite strong, which was one of the things that helped Europe. And across Asia Pacific, whether it be in China or whether it be in some of the electronic products we supply as well, a weaker quarter. 
If we flip to Page 7, Electrical Systems & Services segment, we think a good quarter of performance, a nice rebound from the third quarter. If you look at the margins, up 13.9%. So one of the stronger quarters we've had this year in this segment. The story is much the same, however, in terms of the markets. If you look at the box in the lower left-hand corner, again, the organic sales, down 5%. It was down 5% last quarter as well. And the bookings being down 2%. The play-out is fairly similar that the real weak region was Asia Pacific once again. 
As we have talked over the last couple of years, we, of course, see that the bookings over the last couple of quarters are a fairly good predictor of revenue levels in the next several quarters. And so if you look back to the third quarter of 2015, our bookings were down some 3%. Now they're down 2%, and I think that will help you understand our thinking relative to markets when we talk about that in organic growth for 2016. 
If we move to the next page, Page 8, our Hydraulics segment, very strong margin performance here as well in spite of very weak market conditions. You may recall that in the third quarter, we reported organic sales down 10%. Here in the fourth quarter, they're down 12%. Our bookings, down 22%, and that's pretty much a worldwide story. I mean, if you go around, whether it be the Americas or EMEA or Asia Pacific, the numbers are all negative. And they're negative also when we look at both the distributor and the OEM cut. 
So these markets continue to be very weak. And I think our team has done a really terrific job in terms of really containing costs and driving structural change, and that's why you see, we think, stronger than most people expected margins in the segment of 11.2%. 
If we move to the -- Chart 9, the Aerospace segment, a great quarter for our Aerospace business. They continued having really very, very strong margins. Our bookings were up 6%, and we're particularly pleased in the aftermarket, which you know is an area that we've been working hard to continue to bolster. It was up both on the commercial and the military side for an average of up 14%. 
A lot of discussion over the last couple of weeks about what's happening in the commercial aerospace activity. We'll talk a little bit more about that when we talk about our guidance for next year, but we continue to see that outlook being strong as we move into 2016 and '17. 
And if we move to Chart 10, our Vehicle segment, a really strong quarter of performance from a margin perspective again. And I know a number of you have had concerns that as this business begins to turn down, that it would have a disproportionate impact upon our margins. I think you see here in the fourth quarter, our operating plans and the great job our teams have been doing in getting structural costs out is really having a positive impact, not only here in the fourth quarter, but once again in our guidance for next year. 
NAFTA Class 8 shipments in fact were down in the fourth quarter. They were down 6%. And -- but you see the really strong 18.4% margins here in the quarter. As we look into next year, we'll talk a little bit more about it in just a moment, but our forecast is that we'll see the NAFTA heavy-duty market be on the order of 250,000 units. That's down about 23% from this year, so that is fully incorporated in our planning for next year. 
If we move to Chart 11, maybe just to kind of cap off 2015, we obviously saw organic growth be negative throughout this year. But the fact that we moved in the second quarter to start to really drive structural cost reduction across the company is why you're seeing the real benefits here in the fourth quarter, and that obviously sets up a really important part of our operating plan for 2016. 
Segment margins were 15.2%. Free cash flow, slightly below our target of 100% as we look at this year. We did repurchase 2.4% of our shares outstanding. That's about $682 million we spent on that during this year. We paid down $1 billion of debt this year. And we have completed the Cooper integration, and so really, as we enter into this next year, we're -- you'll see we virtually have no acquisition integration costs anticipated during this -- during 2016 as well. 
2012 (sic) [ Page 12 ], really just for your records, really gives you the kind of breakout of how our restructuring plan laid out during 2015. And as I mentioned up front, our net benefits in the fourth quarter were better than we had laid out for you earlier and I think reflect the momentum we have within our overall restructuring program. 
2000 -- Page 13, titled 2015 Restructuring Costs And Benefits, really give you a view of that full year activity more for your historical background as you think of our performance across the segments. 
I'm now -- going to jump to Chart 14, as we start to talk about our thoughts about 2016. With the weaker markets that we had anticipated in October, you may recall those numbers, I'll go back over them for you in just a moment on a subsequent chart, we've now accelerated and in fact expanded our restructuring actions. And it's our view that a couple of you had commented on it on your writeups this morning, that 2016 and 2017 will remain somewhat challenged time periods in terms of end-market growth. And so our focus is getting the costs out and using our balance sheet to buy back shares and to really get the company well positioned in what will be a period of lower growth than we have seen in previous years. 
So what you see in that chart up top we've tried to laid out for your ease here is that our 2015 actuals, then our '16 and '17 costs, and then the incremental benefits that occur each year, that's incremental to the previous year. And you can see the total. The big news here is that we've expanded the program to a 3-year program. We're going to spend about $400 million. We'll get benefits of just over $400 million over this time period. 
And as you think about 2016, because I know that's of real interest to you, we'll spend about $70 million of that $140 million in the first quarter of this year. About 50% of the balance, so of the balance of the $70 million, will be spent in the second quarter. And then during the third and fourth quarter, the spending is fairly equal. The benefits, however, not much of those incremental benefits of $185 million occur in the first quarter, because we're just kicking off this second phase of actions, and it builds through the balance of the year. So it is a reasonable expectation that it has a bigger contribution to operating earnings per share in the third and fourth quarter than it would have in the second quarter. 
If we jump to Chart 15. And I mentioned before that our view of our markets and organic growth opportunities are lower than they were when we last discussed this with you in October. You recall that we hadn't laid out a formal forecast, but we shared with you some early thoughts on 2016 in our October earnings conference call. And at that time, we talked about organic revenues being down on the order of 1% to 2%. We now, with the benefit of the last several months and I think all the economic news, that not only we but you also have been reading, as well as our detailed discussions with our customers around the world, we think a better expectation tuned up for all that data is that our organic revenues would decline on the order of 2% to 4%. 
As you go through these individual segments, let me just give you a sense for what has changed. As you can see, a rate on the chart, are our organic revenue growth projections for the individual 5 segments we report. For Electrical Products, we think that the organic growth will be in the range of 0% to 2%. In Electrical Systems & Services, a negative 2% to negative 4%. In October, we had said, if you put those 2 together, we thought the growth would be about 1%. 
In the Hydraulics area, we're now forecasting organic growth of negative 9% to negative 11%. In October, we had said we thought it would be about negative 7%. In Aerospace, we're seeing 1% to 3%. Not that much has changed. We thought it would be 3%. And in Vehicle, we had thought it would be negative 7% -- or excuse me, we had thought it would be negative 5% in October. We now think it will be 7% to 9%. 
So what are the big drivers here? Let me start from the bottom, where I ended with Vehicle. We now think the North American heavy-duty market will decline to about 250,000 units. That's the whole market for NAFTA, down 23% from where we finished up just over 320,000 units in 2015. We think the light vehicle markets in the U.S. are going to remain strong, kind of flat to 1% up. We think China will continue to move along fairly well in terms of its light vehicle markets. We think Europe, we're in agreement with most of the consensus that's out there that it's probably up on the order of something like 2%. And we continue to feel that Latin America is a very troubled area, and really, when we talk about the vehicle market, we're talking really about Brazil. And so those numbers will be down 10% to 15% this year. That's what brings us to our 7% to 9%. Within the Hydraulics market, I'd say, really a continuation of the negative expectations in terms of the worldwide ag equipment market and the construction equipment market, and not much positive on the industrial side. And I'd say, again, 9% to 11% is our best approximation, having talked to our customers, and you've seen many of them release their own guidance for 2016. We think this is very much in line with our own projections. 
If we move to Chart 16, titled Segment Operating Margin Expectations, I think it's really noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, we increased our operating margins in spite of negative organic growth, and that is indeed exactly our plan again in 2016. In spite of about $1 billion volume decline, and again, that's about $600 million in organic growth and about $400 million from forex, we expect to expand our segment margins. They finished at 15.2% last year. And as you can see, the midpoint of our guidance is 15.6%, so about a 40 basis point expansion. 
We can obviously talk about each of these as we field your questions. But I would call your attention to Vehicle, because I know many of your concerns in terms of looking at the year of 2016 is that we would see a several hundred point contraction in Vehicle margins as the overall marketplace began to decline. And as you can see, we're confident with our operating plan and the benefit of all the restructuring we're doing, and the fine jobs being done by our team there, that we're going to hold very attractive margins in that segment. And I think that's really a key element in terms of thinking about the valuation of Eaton, because this is one that you've been concerned about historically from a volatility point of view. 
If we turn to Chart 17, labeled our Multi-Year Share Repurchase Program, you'll recall in July, we laid out our new capital plan, which outlined, on an annual basis, repurchasing 1% to 2% of our outstanding shares per year. We paid off this last year, as I mentioned, about $1 billion of debt. We repurchased $682 million or about 2.4% of our outstanding shares. And we had commented through the fall that in this period of time where we're seeing such weakness in equity pricing, and specifically our own, that we were tilting our balanced plan that we'd had of spending about 50% on share repurchase and about 50% on acquisitions, that we were tilting it toward buying back more of our shares. What we're announcing today, obviously, is that we're targeting a $3 billion share repurchase program, and those are for the years 2015 through '18. And so what that means with us having purchased back obviously $682 million last year, is this is about $2.3 billion of purchases over these next 3 years, about 10% of our outstanding shares. That does move us a little closer to sort of an annual buyback that's on the order of more like 2.5% versus 1.5%. 
Now specifically in terms of 2016, you'll recall that I just mentioned the number in 2015, we bought back $682 million. We would expect to buy back about that same level this year, roughly $700 million. It will, as it normally is for us, be back-end loaded in terms of how our cash flow lays out through the year. But it does play an important part in terms of how we offset a slightly higher tax rate. And I'll talk about that in just a moment. 
You'll recall at year-end of 2015, our share count was 460.4 million shares. And so we'll leave it to you to kind of figure out back-end loaded, buying back, about where that will put our full shares, but it's -- we think it's worth around about $0.09 of positive impact. 
So if we move to Chart 18 to kind of pull this all together in terms of our EPS guidance for 2016, let's start with the first quarter. Our operating and fully diluted EPS this year is the same because we don't have acquisition integration costs this year. We think our organic revenue, compared to the fourth quarter, so the actual numbers we just reported, will come down about 5%. For those of you who are already calculating, that means it's down about 8% from last year in the first quarter. The tax rate will be between 8% to 10%. And the segment margin, including the restructuring costs of the $70 million, will be somewhere between 13.5% and 14%. That's what supports our $0.80 to $0.90 operating and fully diluted guidance for the first quarter. 
In terms of the full year, again, no acquisition integration costs. So the $4.15 to $4.45, with a midpoint of, obviously, $4.30, the guidance does include the full net restructuring benefit that we outlined for you, that's on the previous charts, of $174 million, that's a year-to-year benefit from our restructuring, and the $45 million from the Cooper integration savings, which is primarily the full year benefit of the plant closings that we were concluding in the back half of last year. So the operating EPS, and I think this is really the best way to think about our operating plan, we'll have flat operating EPS year-to-year. We'll actually be up 2% in terms of fully diluted because we don't have acquisition integration charges. But that flat operating EPS year-to-year really incorporates having revenues down $1 billion, $600 million of organic, $400 million of FX, margins up 40 basis points, driven by all the restructuring work that we got a good head start on by starting early in 2015. And then the share repurchases of approximately $700 million are basically going to offset the impact of what we anticipate is going to be an increase in the tax rate from roughly 8% last year to roughly 10% as the midpoint of our range this year. 
So if you turn to Page 19, just to recap again. Organic revenue, down 2% to 4%. You'll recall we had a couple of very small acquisitions, so we get a little positive in terms of $35 million in terms of additional revenue. 2% negative forex, that's that $400 million top line impact that I mentioned negative. Operating margins, that was the 40 basis expansion from last year. Corporate expenses, continuing to reflect all of the work that we're doing to get our costs down, not only in our operating units, but across the corporation as well. The tax rate ticking up slightly from last year. I just mentioned the flat operating earnings -- operating EPS and the 2% increase in net income per share. Operating cash flow, $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Free cash flow, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Obviously, that looks like it had been, as a cash conversion ratio of greater than 1, and yes, that's exactly what we're targeting. And then CapEx of about $525 million. 
And I can understand, some of you may have a question, ""Gee, that's pretty similar to what you spent last year. If your volumes are coming down, why are you spending as much CapEx?"" We do have some capital that is involved in all these restructuring actions, and that's really the difference, to facilitate getting them done in areas where we may be closing and consolidating facilities. 
So that's our outlook for '16. We think it's a tight plan. We obviously have had the benefit of looking very hard at these markets, and we're really confident about the restructuring plan that we put together. And so that restructuring plan and our share buyback, very much in our own control, and those are the kind of variables we're trying to control as we move into it into 2016. 
Don, with that, I'll turn things back to you for questions."

Nonres is probably the hardest one of all those numbers to figure out, particularly here in the U.S. There are so many different opinions on nonres. We think much of what's been published is perhaps a little too bullish. We're more in the 3% to 5%. I know there's some people that are at 8%. Gosh, I hope they're right. But that's not what we're basing our expectations on. Utilities, a little better than we've seen it the last couple of years, but it's still kind of a 0% to 2%. Industrial is quite troubled still in terms of just not seeing a lot going, so that's probably a 0% to a negative number. As you get into harsh and hazardous applications that have large portions of oil and gas around them, those are numbers that are like negative 15% type numbers. And then when we look in the large power quality areas, I'd say those markets are likely to be slightly negative again this next year. The last comment I would say is that we just don't see the big large industrial construction numbers that are being so vauntedly reported in many of the government's statistics. We're out there bidding on them all, and we aren't seeing what they're talking about. So that's our view as to how we look. We don't see Asia Pacific getting substantially stronger. We think still that's going to be weakened up by the lack of the big projects there. EMEA is coming back, and I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw a pretty good tone there. And so, again, we're a very low single digit, but it's better than a negative."

Hydraulic, strategically, I mean, I guess if we had, had this perspective that the world was going to be this difficult, we may not have built these businesses or some of the M&A we did kind of more recently. But -- and Sandy, you've made the comment that you can't really adjust your portfolio in terms of spins, right, I guess, until what, 2017, because of Cooper.

We have indicated that we do have the strategic flexibility that if we decide to, we can sell businesses on a taxable basis just as we did the 2 Aerospace businesses that Craig led last year that we felt we could better step out of because they weren't strategically advantaged. Yes, there's no question on Hydraulics. We're dealing with very difficult end markets. We commented on that last year. We don't think that's going to change this year. We actually think the margin performance is pretty commendable in light of where the volumes have been. But we understand it's not at the sort of mid-teen levels right now that we would like to see it at. We do think, with the actions that the team is undertaking, that as we get into the latter part of this year, you're going to see some far more attractive margins than you'll see in the early part of this year, because we're taking some very, very significant steps within that business. We're trying to get this business sized so that it can perform well without having to have a market rebound. Because again, we think we are in a commodity cycle, and clearly, we don't have the benefit of the revenues that we had a number of years ago when we were at the high point. And Craig, you want to add anything to that?"

And you can't find a hydraulic end market today that hasn't gone through a pretty precipitous downturn, whether it's ag or it's China construction, or it's mining, oil and gas, most recently, it's anything tied to capital purchases in -- on the industrial side of the business. And so when we take a look at kind of the end markets that we serve inside of our Hydraulics period, but for the Great Recession, over the last 15 years, we've never seen a period like this in our Hydraulics business. And to Sandy's point, to have a business that in this environment that can still stand up, clearly, margins that aren't at the company average, but margins that are 10% to 11%, we think is pretty remarkable performance from that business. And at some point, these markets will turn, whether or not that's end of '16, '17, but we're -- to Sandy's point, we're putting together a plan today that says we're going to make sure that this business delivers attractive margins at this level of economic activity, and when it turns, it will throw up very handsome incremental profits. And so today, clearly, we're living in a period in the hydraulics space that we don't like it any more than you do. We're doing what we think we need to do, but we think this will be a very attractive business when markets turn, and they will turn."

And so we actually think there hasn't been substantial change in the inventories. They've been low. We don't think we're either suffering from liquidation or there's a lot more liquidation to go on. And the Hydraulics side, clearly, the point Craig just made, our distributors have been dealing with this for a prolonged period of time. I think the one segment where you find, when you travel regionally and you talk to different customers, if an individual distributor, whether they were electrical or whether they were hydraulic, had a unusually high exposure to the oil and gas area, they may still be struggling with some inventories. Because I think that has continued to move in a way that many people didn't predict it would. But I'd say outside of that, I think they're fairly balanced. I think people have got their hats buttoned-down tight and they too are trying to live through a period of time when growth is less than they'd hoped it might be a couple of years ago."

So yes, each of the margins should build and very distinctly in Hydraulics, back to Craig's position, you'll start to see how this plan manifests itself. I think the real big takeaway from yours and many other people's questions is that we're not counting on an economic rebound to drive our plan nor our earnings. What we're counting on is the things that we can control. And that's the very important change that we made at the second quarter of last year when we announced that we were going to drive very significant restructuring, and that we've now added another year to that, but then we also announced an enlarged buyback.

The way we think about kind of this whole road map to reducing our costs is we really think about it in 3 buckets. There is a big bucket around facilities, our manufacturing footprint around the world and distribution centers and offices. And we have a pretty healthy appetite and a backlog of opportunities to continue to rightsize our facility footprint. So that's one big bucket of activity that is undergoing today. And we think that continues for the next several years or so. There's another bucket that really gets to what we call support costs, the number of management layers that we have and the span of control of our leaders, the size of our corporate infrastructure. And that's a whole other element of activity is that we've done a lot to improve it in 2015, and we think that also plays out continually in '16 and perhaps a little bit into '17 as well. And then there's the third bucket that I'd put in the category of really optimizing where you do what you do, and that's really moving more of our activities to low-cost centers. And that's -- we're opening up shared service centers in low-cost countries and putting various activity that we do today, by simply putting them in places where we can do it for much lower costs and in many cases, more efficiently. So those are really the 3 buckets of activities that we're undertaking across the company. And we think it continues to be part of our go-forward plan."

And then we do have inventories that we had built up as part of Cooper that come out. And frankly, we ended the year with a little bit more inventory than we had hoped, simply because of the speed at which sales had come down.

When we look at all the quotations and negotiations we're involved in, the stronger part of the commercial market, from our perspective, and we've got a very big window looking at it, I'm speaking to the U.S. here, has been the smaller projects. So it's been projects that you could say kind of start off the residential base and then get up into kind of medium-sized projects. It's the really big ones that have tended to be a little bit less strong in the marketplace. Now you are seeing a number of big stadiums built around the U.S., that really started in the second quarter of last year, and that's going to continue through this year. But I'd say the weakness we've seen in kind of construction in the U.S. has been the very big power-using construction where a lot medium voltage is used, and that tends to be industrial or very big, big commercial.

We do think that we're in this frustratingly slow environment that can often cause people to use the recession word. But I think that's almost more of a kind of an emotional issue than it is a -- the factual basis. We think that GDP is likely to grow in the mid-2s again this year. However, if you're on the industrial side of the economy, we're seeing industrial production numbers that are more like 1. So that all that we've been -- I'm just repeating what we've probably all read, is that there's been more action on the kind of the consumer and services side than there has been on the industrial side. And that's what's been leading to the lack of capital investment for this MRO kind of industrial malaise, and that's clearly been affecting ours and many of our peers' markets. So I think I would say that's more of the tone. And you compare the U.S. growth to around the world, it's not significantly different than the total global GDP, so there, our country's slower and faster. But that's how we'd see it. We just think this is -- it's a time when it's really critical that companies get their cost base adjusted, that they don't assume that economic growth is going to bail them out, and that they control those things that they can control. And that's exactly what our plan is all about, but it's not based on and nor do we think it's a high probability that there's a recession."

Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the presentation that was posted at our Investor portal earlier today, and for the sake of brevity, I'll start right on Page 3, the highlights of our fourth quarter results. 
I think as you saw, we exceeded the guidance we gave for our revenue guidance. We achieved record fourth quarter segment margins. We generated $742 million in operating cash flow, and we repurchased $228 million of our own shares. We think a very strong quarter in the midst of pretty choppy end markets, and I think it concludes the year on a strong basis. 
If we flip to the second chart, just a couple of the highlights in terms of the reconciliation to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter, you recall the midpoint of our guidance was $1.10. Our volume came in just slightly higher than we had guided to. You recall that we had guided organic sales being down 3% from the third quarter actuals; they actually came in at 2%. Our -- the net of our restructuring costs and our savings came in about $0.02 better. We got all the savings and more that we were looking for, and we actually got it done at a little bit less cost. 
Our tax rate did come in a little bit lower, about $0.02, it's the 3.9% versus the roughly 5.5% we had guided to. And then our corporate expenses reflecting that same orientation. We tried really getting our structural costs down, that you saw also manifest itself in our very strong segment performance, contributed $0.02. So a $0.07 beat for the quarter, a nice way to finish up the year. 
If we turn to Page 5. Just the overall financial numbers. I'm sure you've had an opportunity to study these. I would just reference one number in particular here, because it does tie in to -- a lot to our thinking relative to having increased our restructuring over the next couple of years, is the organic growth number, which you see in the green box, the lower left of the chart, down some 4%. It was down 3% last year, so -- or last quarter, the third quarter. So again, as you think through the year last year, we actually started out with a first quarter that was slightly up and then the second, third and fourth quarter, we've seen our markets weaken. 
Just a quick run through the individual segments, and then we'll get on to the guidance for '16, which I think is what most of you are most interested in trying to get some additional color around. Let's start with the Electrical Products segment. That's on Page 6. As you can see, organic growth of down 1%. It was actually flat in the third quarter. You can see very strong margin performance, 17.7%; volume relationship to last year, down 5%. And obviously, you see forex was 4 points of that. 
Looking at the bookings. Bookings were down 1%. And it's interesting, as you look around the world, quite different conditions by region. The Americas were flattish. Europe was up nicely. And Asia Pacific, both in this segment as well as in our Systems & Services Electrical segment, down fairly hard. And we think that reflects the real weakness that's been going on in China. We'll talk a little bit more about that as we go on in the call. 
Net restructuring, as you see, a slight positive to the quarter. A good solid quarter, and as you get down within the individual areas, clearly, we're continuing to see strengthening in our lighting products. Residential continues to be strong here in the U.S. Canada is weak. Middle East it was quite strong, which was one of the things that helped Europe. And across Asia Pacific, whether it be in China or whether it be in some of the electronic products we supply as well, a weaker quarter. 
If we flip to Page 7, Electrical Systems & Services segment, we think a good quarter of performance, a nice rebound from the third quarter. If you look at the margins, up 13.9%. So one of the stronger quarters we've had this year in this segment. The story is much the same, however, in terms of the markets. If you look at the box in the lower left-hand corner, again, the organic sales, down 5%. It was down 5% last quarter as well. And the bookings being down 2%. The play-out is fairly similar that the real weak region was Asia Pacific once again. 
As we have talked over the last couple of years, we, of course, see that the bookings over the last couple of quarters are a fairly good predictor of revenue levels in the next several quarters. And so if you look back to the third quarter of 2015, our bookings were down some 3%. Now they're down 2%, and I think that will help you understand our thinking relative to markets when we talk about that in organic growth for 2016. 
If we move to the next page, Page 8, our Hydraulics segment, very strong margin performance here as well in spite of very weak market conditions. You may recall that in the third quarter, we reported organic sales down 10%. Here in the fourth quarter, they're down 12%. Our bookings, down 22%, and that's pretty much a worldwide story. I mean, if you go around, whether it be the Americas or EMEA or Asia Pacific, the numbers are all negative. And they're negative also when we look at both the distributor and the OEM cut. 
So these markets continue to be very weak. And I think our team has done a really terrific job in terms of really containing costs and driving structural change, and that's why you see, we think, stronger than most people expected margins in the segment of 11.2%. 
If we move to the -- Chart 9, the Aerospace segment, a great quarter for our Aerospace business. They continued having really very, very strong margins. Our bookings were up 6%, and we're particularly pleased in the aftermarket, which you know is an area that we've been working hard to continue to bolster. It was up both on the commercial and the military side for an average of up 14%. 
A lot of discussion over the last couple of weeks about what's happening in the commercial aerospace activity. We'll talk a little bit more about that when we talk about our guidance for next year, but we continue to see that outlook being strong as we move into 2016 and '17. 
And if we move to Chart 10, our Vehicle segment, a really strong quarter of performance from a margin perspective again. And I know a number of you have had concerns that as this business begins to turn down, that it would have a disproportionate impact upon our margins. I think you see here in the fourth quarter, our operating plans and the great job our teams have been doing in getting structural costs out is really having a positive impact, not only here in the fourth quarter, but once again in our guidance for next year. 
NAFTA Class 8 shipments in fact were down in the fourth quarter. They were down 6%. And -- but you see the really strong 18.4% margins here in the quarter. As we look into next year, we'll talk a little bit more about it in just a moment, but our forecast is that we'll see the NAFTA heavy-duty market be on the order of 250,000 units. That's down about 23% from this year, so that is fully incorporated in our planning for next year. 
If we move to Chart 11, maybe just to kind of cap off 2015, we obviously saw organic growth be negative throughout this year. But the fact that we moved in the second quarter to start to really drive structural cost reduction across the company is why you're seeing the real benefits here in the fourth quarter, and that obviously sets up a really important part of our operating plan for 2016. 
Segment margins were 15.2%. Free cash flow, slightly below our target of 100% as we look at this year. We did repurchase 2.4% of our shares outstanding. That's about $682 million we spent on that during this year. We paid down $1 billion of debt this year. And we have completed the Cooper integration, and so really, as we enter into this next year, we're -- you'll see we virtually have no acquisition integration costs anticipated during this -- during 2016 as well. 
2012 (sic) [ Page 12 ], really just for your records, really gives you the kind of breakout of how our restructuring plan laid out during 2015. And as I mentioned up front, our net benefits in the fourth quarter were better than we had laid out for you earlier and I think reflect the momentum we have within our overall restructuring program. 
2000 -- Page 13, titled 2015 Restructuring Costs And Benefits, really give you a view of that full year activity more for your historical background as you think of our performance across the segments. 
I'm now -- going to jump to Chart 14, as we start to talk about our thoughts about 2016. With the weaker markets that we had anticipated in October, you may recall those numbers, I'll go back over them for you in just a moment on a subsequent chart, we've now accelerated and in fact expanded our restructuring actions. And it's our view that a couple of you had commented on it on your writeups this morning, that 2016 and 2017 will remain somewhat challenged time periods in terms of end-market growth. And so our focus is getting the costs out and using our balance sheet to buy back shares and to really get the company well positioned in what will be a period of lower growth than we have seen in previous years. 
So what you see in that chart up top we've tried to laid out for your ease here is that our 2015 actuals, then our '16 and '17 costs, and then the incremental benefits that occur each year, that's incremental to the previous year. And you can see the total. The big news here is that we've expanded the program to a 3-year program. We're going to spend about $400 million. We'll get benefits of just over $400 million over this time period. 
And as you think about 2016, because I know that's of real interest to you, we'll spend about $70 million of that $140 million in the first quarter of this year. About 50% of the balance, so of the balance of the $70 million, will be spent in the second quarter. And then during the third and fourth quarter, the spending is fairly equal. The benefits, however, not much of those incremental benefits of $185 million occur in the first quarter, because we're just kicking off this second phase of actions, and it builds through the balance of the year. So it is a reasonable expectation that it has a bigger contribution to operating earnings per share in the third and fourth quarter than it would have in the second quarter. 
If we jump to Chart 15. And I mentioned before that our view of our markets and organic growth opportunities are lower than they were when we last discussed this with you in October. You recall that we hadn't laid out a formal forecast, but we shared with you some early thoughts on 2016 in our October earnings conference call. And at that time, we talked about organic revenues being down on the order of 1% to 2%. We now, with the benefit of the last several months and I think all the economic news, that not only we but you also have been reading, as well as our detailed discussions with our customers around the world, we think a better expectation tuned up for all that data is that our organic revenues would decline on the order of 2% to 4%. 
As you go through these individual segments, let me just give you a sense for what has changed. As you can see, a rate on the chart, are our organic revenue growth projections for the individual 5 segments we report. For Electrical Products, we think that the organic growth will be in the range of 0% to 2%. In Electrical Systems & Services, a negative 2% to negative 4%. In October, we had said, if you put those 2 together, we thought the growth would be about 1%. 
In the Hydraulics area, we're now forecasting organic growth of negative 9% to negative 11%. In October, we had said we thought it would be about negative 7%. In Aerospace, we're seeing 1% to 3%. Not that much has changed. We thought it would be 3%. And in Vehicle, we had thought it would be negative 7% -- or excuse me, we had thought it would be negative 5% in October. We now think it will be 7% to 9%. 
So what are the big drivers here? Let me start from the bottom, where I ended with Vehicle. We now think the North American heavy-duty market will decline to about 250,000 units. That's the whole market for NAFTA, down 23% from where we finished up just over 320,000 units in 2015. We think the light vehicle markets in the U.S. are going to remain strong, kind of flat to 1% up. We think China will continue to move along fairly well in terms of its light vehicle markets. We think Europe, we're in agreement with most of the consensus that's out there that it's probably up on the order of something like 2%. And we continue to feel that Latin America is a very troubled area, and really, when we talk about the vehicle market, we're talking really about Brazil. And so those numbers will be down 10% to 15% this year. That's what brings us to our 7% to 9%. Within the Hydraulics market, I'd say, really a continuation of the negative expectations in terms of the worldwide ag equipment market and the construction equipment market, and not much positive on the industrial side. And I'd say, again, 9% to 11% is our best approximation, having talked to our customers, and you've seen many of them release their own guidance for 2016. We think this is very much in line with our own projections. 
If we move to Chart 16, titled Segment Operating Margin Expectations, I think it's really noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, we increased our operating margins in spite of negative organic growth, and that is indeed exactly our plan again in 2016. In spite of about $1 billion volume decline, and again, that's about $600 million in organic growth and about $400 million from forex, we expect to expand our segment margins. They finished at 15.2% last year. And as you can see, the midpoint of our guidance is 15.6%, so about a 40 basis point expansion. 
We can obviously talk about each of these as we field your questions. But I would call your attention to Vehicle, because I know many of your concerns in terms of looking at the year of 2016 is that we would see a several hundred point contraction in Vehicle margins as the overall marketplace began to decline. And as you can see, we're confident with our operating plan and the benefit of all the restructuring we're doing, and the fine jobs being done by our team there, that we're going to hold very attractive margins in that segment. And I think that's really a key element in terms of thinking about the valuation of Eaton, because this is one that you've been concerned about historically from a volatility point of view. 
If we turn to Chart 17, labeled our Multi-Year Share Repurchase Program, you'll recall in July, we laid out our new capital plan, which outlined, on an annual basis, repurchasing 1% to 2% of our outstanding shares per year. We paid off this last year, as I mentioned, about $1 billion of debt. We repurchased $682 million or about 2.4% of our outstanding shares. And we had commented through the fall that in this period of time where we're seeing such weakness in equity pricing, and specifically our own, that we were tilting our balanced plan that we'd had of spending about 50% on share repurchase and about 50% on acquisitions, that we were tilting it toward buying back more of our shares. What we're announcing today, obviously, is that we're targeting a $3 billion share repurchase program, and those are for the years 2015 through '18. And so what that means with us having purchased back obviously $682 million last year, is this is about $2.3 billion of purchases over these next 3 years, about 10% of our outstanding shares. That does move us a little closer to sort of an annual buyback that's on the order of more like 2.5% versus 1.5%. 
Now specifically in terms of 2016, you'll recall that I just mentioned the number in 2015, we bought back $682 million. We would expect to buy back about that same level this year, roughly $700 million. It will, as it normally is for us, be back-end loaded in terms of how our cash flow lays out through the year. But it does play an important part in terms of how we offset a slightly higher tax rate. And I'll talk about that in just a moment. 
You'll recall at year-end of 2015, our share count was 460.4 million shares. And so we'll leave it to you to kind of figure out back-end loaded, buying back, about where that will put our full shares, but it's -- we think it's worth around about $0.09 of positive impact. 
So if we move to Chart 18 to kind of pull this all together in terms of our EPS guidance for 2016, let's start with the first quarter. Our operating and fully diluted EPS this year is the same because we don't have acquisition integration costs this year. We think our organic revenue, compared to the fourth quarter, so the actual numbers we just reported, will come down about 5%. For those of you who are already calculating, that means it's down about 8% from last year in the first quarter. The tax rate will be between 8% to 10%. And the segment margin, including the restructuring costs of the $70 million, will be somewhere between 13.5% and 14%. That's what supports our $0.80 to $0.90 operating and fully diluted guidance for the first quarter. 
In terms of the full year, again, no acquisition integration costs. So the $4.15 to $4.45, with a midpoint of, obviously, $4.30, the guidance does include the full net restructuring benefit that we outlined for you, that's on the previous charts, of $174 million, that's a year-to-year benefit from our restructuring, and the $45 million from the Cooper integration savings, which is primarily the full year benefit of the plant closings that we were concluding in the back half of last year. So the operating EPS, and I think this is really the best way to think about our operating plan, we'll have flat operating EPS year-to-year. We'll actually be up 2% in terms of fully diluted because we don't have acquisition integration charges. But that flat operating EPS year-to-year really incorporates having revenues down $1 billion, $600 million of organic, $400 million of FX, margins up 40 basis points, driven by all the restructuring work that we got a good head start on by starting early in 2015. And then the share repurchases of approximately $700 million are basically going to offset the impact of what we anticipate is going to be an increase in the tax rate from roughly 8% last year to roughly 10% as the midpoint of our range this year. 
So if you turn to Page 19, just to recap again. Organic revenue, down 2% to 4%. You'll recall we had a couple of very small acquisitions, so we get a little positive in terms of $35 million in terms of additional revenue. 2% negative forex, that's that $400 million top line impact that I mentioned negative. Operating margins, that was the 40 basis expansion from last year. Corporate expenses, continuing to reflect all of the work that we're doing to get our costs down, not only in our operating units, but across the corporation as well. The tax rate ticking up slightly from last year. I just mentioned the flat operating earnings -- operating EPS and the 2% increase in net income per share. Operating cash flow, $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. Free cash flow, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Obviously, that looks like it had been, as a cash conversion ratio of greater than 1, and yes, that's exactly what we're targeting. And then CapEx of about $525 million. 
And I can understand, some of you may have a question, ""Gee, that's pretty similar to what you spent last year. If your volumes are coming down, why are you spending as much CapEx?"" We do have some capital that is involved in all these restructuring actions, and that's really the difference, to facilitate getting them done in areas where we may be closing and consolidating facilities. 
So that's our outlook for '16. We think it's a tight plan. We obviously have had the benefit of looking very hard at these markets, and we're really confident about the restructuring plan that we put together. And so that restructuring plan and our share buyback, very much in our own control, and those are the kind of variables we're trying to control as we move into it into 2016. 
Don, with that, I'll turn things back to you for questions."

Nonres is probably the hardest one of all those numbers to figure out, particularly here in the U.S. There are so many different opinions on nonres. We think much of what's been published is perhaps a little too bullish. We're more in the 3% to 5%. I know there's some people that are at 8%. Gosh, I hope they're right. But that's not what we're basing our expectations on. Utilities, a little better than we've seen it the last couple of years, but it's still kind of a 0% to 2%. Industrial is quite troubled still in terms of just not seeing a lot going, so that's probably a 0% to a negative number. As you get into harsh and hazardous applications that have large portions of oil and gas around them, those are numbers that are like negative 15% type numbers. And then when we look in the large power quality areas, I'd say those markets are likely to be slightly negative again this next year. The last comment I would say is that we just don't see the big large industrial construction numbers that are being so vauntedly reported in many of the government's statistics. We're out there bidding on them all, and we aren't seeing what they're talking about. So that's our view as to how we look. We don't see Asia Pacific getting substantially stronger. We think still that's going to be weakened up by the lack of the big projects there. EMEA is coming back, and I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw a pretty good tone there. And so, again, we're a very low single digit, but it's better than a negative."

Yes, there's no question on Hydraulics. We're dealing with very difficult end markets. We commented on that last year. We don't think that's going to change this year. We actually think the margin performance is pretty commendable in light of where the volumes have been. But we understand it's not at the sort of mid-teen levels right now that we would like to see it at. We do think, with the actions that the team is undertaking, that as we get into the latter part of this year, you're going to see some far more attractive margins than you'll see in the early part of this year, because we're taking some very, very significant steps within that business. We're trying to get this business sized so that it can perform well without having to have a market rebound.

And you can't find a hydraulic end market today that hasn't gone through a pretty precipitous downturn, whether it's ag or it's China construction, or it's mining, oil and gas, most recently, it's anything tied to capital purchases in -- on the industrial side of the business. And so when we take a look at kind of the end markets that we serve inside of our Hydraulics period, but for the Great Recession, over the last 15 years, we've never seen a period like this in our Hydraulics business. And to Sandy's point, to have a business that in this environment that can still stand up, clearly, margins that aren't at the company average, but margins that are 10% to 11%, we think is pretty remarkable performance from that business. And at some point, these markets will turn, whether or not that's end of '16, '17, but we're -- to Sandy's point, we're putting together a plan today that says we're going to make sure that this business delivers attractive margins at this level of economic activity, and when it turns, it will throw up very handsome incremental profits.

And the Hydraulics side, clearly, the point Craig just made, our distributors have been dealing with this for a prolonged period of time. I think the one segment where you find, when you travel regionally and you talk to different customers, if an individual distributor, whether they were electrical or whether they were hydraulic, had a unusually high exposure to the oil and gas area, they may still be struggling with some inventories. Because I think that has continued to move in a way that many people didn't predict it would. But I'd say outside of that, I think they're fairly balanced.

But I think it's less of an inventory issue today in that it now is just very low levels of utilization."

So yes, each of the margins should build and very distinctly in Hydraulics, back to Craig's position, you'll start to see how this plan manifests itself. I think the real big takeaway from yours and many other people's questions is that we're not counting on an economic rebound to drive our plan nor our earnings. What we're counting on is the things that we can control. And that's the very important change that we made at the second quarter of last year when we announced that we were going to drive very significant restructuring, and that we've now added another year to that, but then we also announced an enlarged buyback. Those are 2 things we can control. And we think in this environment, where there is so much that people are uncertain about, we're putting the premium on let's deliver certainty where we can."

The way we think about kind of this whole road map to reducing our costs is we really think about it in 3 buckets. There is a big bucket around facilities, our manufacturing footprint around the world and distribution centers and offices. And we have a pretty healthy appetite and a backlog of opportunities to continue to rightsize our facility footprint. So that's one big bucket of activity that is undergoing today. And we think that continues for the next several years or so. There's another bucket that really gets to what we call support costs, the number of management layers that we have and the span of control of our leaders, the size of our corporate infrastructure. And that's a whole other element of activity is that we've done a lot to improve it in 2015, and we think that also plays out continually in '16 and perhaps a little bit into '17 as well. And then there's the third bucket that I'd put in the category of really optimizing where you do what you do, and that's really moving more of our activities to low-cost centers. And that's -- we're opening up shared service centers in low-cost countries and putting various activity that we do today, by simply putting them in places where we can do it for much lower costs and in many cases, more efficiently. So those are really the 3 buckets of activities that we're undertaking across the company. And we think it continues to be part of our go-forward plan."

And then we do have inventories that we had built up as part of Cooper that come out. And frankly, we ended the year with a little bit more inventory than we had hoped, simply because of the speed at which sales had come down.

When we look at all the quotations and negotiations we're involved in, the stronger part of the commercial market, from our perspective, and we've got a very big window looking at it, I'm speaking to the U.S. here, has been the smaller projects. So it's been projects that you could say kind of start off the residential base and then get up into kind of medium-sized projects. It's the really big ones that have tended to be a little bit less strong in the marketplace. Now you are seeing a number of big stadiums built around the U.S., that really started in the second quarter of last year, and that's going to continue through this year. But I'd say the weakness we've seen in kind of construction in the U.S. has been the very big power-using construction where a lot medium voltage is used, and that tends to be industrial or very big, big commercial.

We do think that we're in this frustratingly slow environment that can often cause people to use the recession word. But I think that's almost more of a kind of an emotional issue than it is a -- the factual basis. We think that GDP is likely to grow in the mid-2s again this year. However, if you're on the industrial side of the economy, we're seeing industrial production numbers that are more like 1. So that all that we've been -- I'm just repeating what we've probably all read, is that there's been more action on the kind of the consumer and services side than there has been on the industrial side. And that's what's been leading to the lack of capital investment for this MRO kind of industrial malaise, and that's clearly been affecting ours and many of our peers' markets. So I think I would say that's more of the tone. And you compare the U.S. growth to around the world, it's not significantly different than the total global GDP, so there, our country's slower and faster. But that's how we'd see it. We just think this is -- it's a time when it's really critical that companies get their cost base adjusted, that they don't assume that economic growth is going to bail them out, and that they control those things that they can control. And that's exactly what our plan is all about, but it's not based on and nor do we think it's a high probability that there's a recession."

Thanks for joining us. I'll be working again from the presentation that was posted earlier this morning. And why don't we turn to Page 3? It's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results. I think as you saw from our earni",2794,"Great. Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll be working again from the presentation that was posted earlier this morning. And why don't we turn to Page 3? It's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results. I think as you saw from our earnings release, our quarter was slightly ahead of our original expectations, coming in, in the upper half of our range. It positions us very much on plan for our full year guidance. And really not much has changed in terms of our view of either how markets will progress this year, how we're seeing the economy nor how we see our prospects for this year. 
You saw the operating earnings per share were $0.88. Our sales of $4.8 million (sic) [billion] were down 8% from a year ago. Organic revenue was down 6%. You may recall that compared to the fourth quarter, we had said that we'd expected our first quarter sales to be down about 5%. We actually came in a little bit better than that. And the ForEx impact of down 2%. 
Really strong segment margins, exactly in line with what we had outlined in terms of our guidance. And when you exclude the restructuring costs that are part of our 3-year restructuring program, margins were actually 15.1%, really quite strong for our business mix in the first quarter. 
Very pleased with our cash flow in the first quarter, $371 million. We're able to purchase back $100 million. You'll recall our full year plan is for a $700 million buyback. And then we announced the dividend increase, the 4% increase in February. 
If we move on to Page 4, just a comparison to our guidance. Pretty simple, higher revenue than we expected, primarily organic, a little bit FX for $0.02. And then we did spend a little bit less than we had anticipated. We had shared with you we were going to spend on the order of $70 million in the first quarter for restructuring expense. That total came in closer to $63 million, so that contributed about $0.01. As I'll mention in just a couple of minutes, we do expect to spend those dollars later in the year, and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that, but overall, $0.88, a great start for the year. 
Turning to Page 5. I think you saw most of these numbers in the press release. I would remind you that our fourth quarter volume, fourth quarter 2015 was $5.057 billion, and so as you can see, came off just a little bit less than the 5% we had guided to. 
Our organic growth in the fourth quarter was 4%. Here in the first quarter, it was a negative 6%. We anticipate this is the worst quarter in terms of the year-over-year. We know that our full year guidance is a negative 2% to a negative 4%. Clearly, the comparisons in the second half get quite a bit easier than they are here in the first part of the year. 
If we could flip to the individual segments now and we'll start with the Electrical Products segment. You find that on Page 6 of the packet. Clearly, a very good quarter. A number of you have commented on that already this morning that we're very pleased with the 16.1% operating margins, 17.1% without restructuring costs. 
If you look at our organic sales growth, it was 0 or flat this quarter, it was a negative 1% last quarter. And we're encouraged that our bookings in the first quarter were 2%. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, they were negative 1% and they were flat in the first -- in the third quarter of last year, so a little bit of an acceleration. 
And as you look around the world and I'm sure you're all interested in terms of trying to understand sort of the tenor of the business and where the strength and weaknesses around the world, the U.S. continues to be stronger than that average of 2%. We're very pleased with what we saw. EMEA began to tick up a little bit and I think that's in line with what you saw in some of the releases last night, earlier this morning about more economic strength in the European region. 
The weakness continues to be in Asia where we've seen double-digit downs in Asia. And I think not only us but you've heard from other companies, conditions in Asia continue to be quite weak. Among the individual products, we had talked to you that generally, the theme that we've been seeing over the last 9 months has been weaknesses in industrial markets, more strength in residential and nonresidential construction. We actually had a very good quarter in our single-phase Power Quality, and I'll comment when we get to Systems & Services we also did in our 3-phase [ph] in that area. 
If we flip to the next chart please, which is Chart 7, Electrical Systems & Services segment. The volume of $1.342 billion, down about 10% from the fourth quarter. You remember the fourth quarter was $1.494 billion. And I think as we told you, a good way to think about this segment in terms of shipment and perspective shipment volumes is to look at bookings. And so bookings were down 2% this quarter. You'll recall in the fourth quarter, they were also down 2%. In the third quarter, they were down 3%. 
So we continue to see weakness here and a number of it traces to some of the macros that we've all discussed. Our Crouse-Hinds business that has a significant oil and gas exposure is in this segment. Some of the large industrial projects that we would tend to work on are in this area. We continue to see those weak as well. And so as we continue to look to the year, I'll talk to you a little bit about segment margins. 
We started off a little lower than we'd anticipated we might. That's why we've revised our margins for the year. I'll comment more on that as we get to the next couple of charts. Within the regional area, again, the U.S. and EMEA being the stronger areas, the far weaker areas being Asia Pacific at this point so a common theme, and you'll year that in the number of our businesses. 
Moving to the next chart, Chart #8 or Page 8, our Hydraulics segment. Sales of $551 million, virtually flat with what we saw in the fourth quarter. You remember it was $552 million at that point. You'll see the operating margins of 7.4% and when you exclude the restructuring, 10.3%. Obviously, we're doing a lot of work in this segment as we had shared with you, and as Craig and his team had outlined in our February New York analyst meeting. 
The organic sales down some 14%. You'll recall they were down 12% in the fourth quarter. Bookings down some 10%. And here we saw weakness in the U.S. as well as in Asia Pacific. I don't think the story is much different here in terms of our seeing weakness both on the distributor and on the OEM side. And we've seen weakness both on the stationary and the mobile side. 
So to the question, have we bottomed in our Hydraulic end markets? We don't have the visibility to see that it has bottomed at this point. We're comfortable when we shared with you some revised views of market growth in this area. And so our plan is very much the same. We continue to restructure the business during 2016 and not to count on an upturn in terms of volume.
Turning to Page #9, our Aerospace segment. Volume's up just slightly from the fourth quarter, down from a year ago but really terrific, terrific results in terms of our operating margins, 18% in the quarter. 18.9% without the restructuring. Very solid second quarter in a row of bookings up 6%. 
Our Aftermarket was down in this particular quarter, but we really believe that's much more of an issue of having had a very large quarter of Aftermarket bookings in the first quarter of 2015. And so we don't think this is a trend. We think it's really much more of a comparable issue. Organic growth was down 3%. Obviously, was -- excuse me, it was a positive in the fourth quarter of about 2%, so a little longer growth but really strong margins and strong bookings.
If we turn to Page 10, our Vehicle segment. Clearly, we're beginning to see some of the impact of our original forecast of the North American heavy-duty truck market coming down to 250,000. We've actually not changed our full year forecast of it coming down to 230,000 units. Had a first quarter that was relatively strong but -- and we can talk more in the Q&A. 
As we've seen production schedules and orders progress into this year, it's our sense that this market's going to be closer to the 230,000 range than the 250,000 range. All this is already in our guidance. Strong margin performance. You see the organic sales down some 13%. You'll recall they were down 6% in the fourth quarter as we began to see this kind of rollover, if you will, in the heavy-duty market. 
If we move to the next page, Page 11, no change in terms of our view of total organic revenues for this year. Still we believe they'll come down 2% to 4%, obviously with the first quarter of down 6%. This does anticipate, and we do believe we will see much better comparisons as the year come on, so this kind of centerpoint of a negative 3%. 
As we look at our first quarter experience and our update of looking at individual markets, you'll see 2 changes on this page from the guidance we provided you earlier this year. We've raised the guidance in terms of organic growth in Electrical Products, a great first quarter. Residential markets saw stronger than we originally anticipated. Those being the 2 big contributors to our increasing of our guidance for Electrical Products. 
Then in the vehicle markets, really 2 changes there, the North American heavy-duty markets, I mentioned to you, would be down about at 230,000 units of production versus the 250,000 we had originally anticipated. So that's about a 29% reduction, the 230,000 over last year. 
And then Latin America continues to be weak and clearly, we all are, I think, up-to-date with the tremendous problems in Brazil, currently but weaker markets further. And so those really being the 2 changes within the vehicle market. Overall still 2% to 4%. 
A quick update on our restructuring actions on Page 12. You'll recall again a 3-year program, the work that's going on by teams all across the company really well done, keeping very much to our schedules. We did, as I mentioned in my original comments this morning, we incurred about $63 million of restructuring expense versus the guidance we had provided you of roughly $70 million. 
We really have -- that expense of that $7 million will move out to the second half. We've got one project that's really moved from Q1 to Q3, but overall, we think that we will still be at about $140 million of restructuring costs. And as you look at that $42 million in the second half, just to give you some sense for pacing, we think about 70% roughly of that is likely to be in the third quarter, with the remaining roughly 30% will be in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, our overall year-to-year incremental annual benefit of $185 million remain unchanged. Some of you may ask, how can you have project move out and it doesn't change your overall benefits? Remember, that this incremental $185 million of savings included both carryover benefits from actions we had taken last year in 2015 as well as the new actions we've taken in 2016. It was in that overall mix of obviously our projects moving ahead and back and quite a lot of activity overall, where we're very comfortable with the $185 million still being realized here in 2016.
On Page 13 titled Segment Operating Margins Expectations. I've mentioned to you we've made a couple of changes here that relate to changes, really what's going on in the market again. Our Electrical Products, as you can see, we've moved our guidance up to 17.4% to 18.0% for margins after the very strong first quarter that we've had. You'll recall it was 17.0% to 17.6%. 
In our Electrical Systems & Services, we've moved down to 13.1% to 13.7%. It previously had been 13.7% to 14.3%. Really just a couple of items driving that. A little bigger commercial mix, a little weaker industrial mix and continued pressure in the oil and gas markets. 
No change in Hydraulics, no change in Aerospace. In our vehicle business, we've moved it down to 16.2% to 16.8%. It was 16.7% to 17.3%. And that's really the impact of the 230,000-unit production for NAFTA heavy-duty Class 8 versus our earlier forecast of 250,000.
Looking ahead to the second quarter after what we think is a very solid and good start to the year in the first quarter, Page 14, it's entitled EPS Guidance. Second quarter, our guidance is the range of $1 to $1.10 operating EPS, and it's virtually the same as net income because we don't have acquisition restructuring expense. 
Organic revenue sequentially moving up 5% from Q1 2016 to Q2 2016. As we've talked in the last couple of years, that is a pretty normal seasonal for us, the 5% step-up from the first quarter to the second quarter. The first quarter is always our weakest quarter in terms of revenue. 
And then we would expect as FX is turning out to be less than we had forecast earlier this year, that we expect we'll get about 1 point bump up from ForEx too so likely revenue's up on the order of 6%. Segment margins, including all the restructuring expense and the restructuring benefits as well as the incremental on the higher volume in the second quarter between 15% to 16% and a tax rate that'll be between 10% to 12%. Our guidance for the year remains unchanged, and each of the comments underneath the guidance on this page are the same that you saw from us in our first quarter guidance, so no change there as well.
If we move to Page 15, the 2016 Outlook Summary. Again, the only changes that you find on this page or really no changes on this page. We've just had some change on what I call the mix under a couple of these numbers. Once again, the operating EPS for this year is flat with a year ago. And then the net income per share is up some 2%.
So if you move to Page 16, a quick summary of our report today. Again, we think a really strong start to the year, solid first quarter. Record first quarter cash flow and continuing to buy back shares as well as obviously have a dividend increase. 2016, as I mentioned earlier, we really don't see the year much differently than we did when we laid out the guidance for this year, laid out our operating plan. And that's why we're continuing to work on our $400 million restructuring plan and the $3 billion share buyback plan because I think they're exactly what's needed during a period of this type of economic weakness. 
We've tuned 2 things within 2016: one is the modestly weaker NAFTA heavy-duty production forecast; and the second is that we think ForEx is now likely to be -- impact our revenues by a negative $200 million versus the original negative $400 million. And I'm sure we'll have questions about why our EPS full year guidance hasn't changed. And a very easy way to think about this is roughly the reduction in the ForEx, a negative impact on sales and profit basically offsets the lower market expectation now for the NAFTA heavy-duty truck forecast. 
Restructuring program, just full of good news here, continues to be very much as we thought, being able to realize the potential. Our teams are really creating great results around the world, and our full year incremental benefits remain unchanged at $185 million, and the cost remain unchanged at $140 million. And as I said several times already this morning, our capital allocation plan to buy back the $700 million in shares following the $682 million that we bought back last year remains unchanged. So Don, I'll turn things back to you."

And it has helped that what we've seen over the last couple of years as we've seen strength in these areas in the U.S. that hadn't seen much strength in Europe in that regard. And Europe's had a far better quarter in that regard as well. So I would point to those as being the areas of real strength. The areas that have offset because you look at 2% and say that's not the kind of growth we were seeing a couple of years ago, have been still the industrial markets so that's both industrial MRO and industrial OEM, continue to be the weak spots.

And in our vehicle businesses, the markets on the light vehicle side has stayed relatively strong. They've been pretty choppy in the commercial vehicles over the last couple of years. That's probably the biggest piece. But I would say that Asia, in general, has not been stronger in this time period. Craig, would you add anything to that?"

As you probably saw in some of the data, we're not a big player but the truck market in Europe is still doing well. Yes, we had some perhaps a little bit of another lag down in South America, but at this point, the denominator is so small that it really doesn't matter a lot. It's a really is a function of the North America Class 8 market. And coming into the year, we have a 250,000 number out there for the market, which was quite frankly, one of the weaker numbers of anybody forecasting the market. And coming into the earlier part of this year, it appears that we have about 20,000 units of inventory overhang that fundamentally affecting the North America Class 8 market. If you take a look at ATA  truck tonnage or some of the key markets that are the indicators for those markets longer term, those markets are doing okay. And so we really think we're going through a bit of an inventory correction right now in North America Class 8, and that's principally the reason we reduced our forecast. And at 230,000, we think once again, we have one of the more conservative numbers out there. So at this juncture, we think we're well positioned in terms of the year, and so we don't think this is going to be a case of every quarter another downward revision."

There is a portion of that business that does come in during the quarter and go out. And that's the piece that's a little harder for us to forecast. And in some cases, that is MRO for the oil and gas area. And so that's an area is a little harder for us to look ahead. I think we entered this year thinking oil and gas will be down on the basis of 15%. It's every bit of that. Weather turns out to be more than that. I guess we'll know come year-end. But even though we've seen oil move up to the mid-$40s, that segment's just not investing right now. And they're still very much in a cutting back mode at this point. It's going to take some time before we see that start to come back in the other direction. And to the other issue for us to keep an eye on here is whether we start to see confidence in and around reinvestment in industrial projects, and we've really not seen that to date.

Thanks for joining us. I'll be working again from the presentation that was posted earlier this morning. And why don't we turn to Page 3? It's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results.

And why don't we turn to Page 3? It's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results. I think as you saw from our earnings release, our quarter was slightly ahead of our original expectations, coming in, in the upper half of our range. It positions us very much on plan for our full year guidance. And really not much has changed in terms of our view of either how markets will progress this year, how we're seeing the economy nor how we see our prospects for this year.
You saw the operating earning per share were $0.88. Our sales of $4.8 million (sic) [billion] were down 8% from a year ago. Organic revenue was down 6%. You may recall that compared to the fourth quarter, we had said that we'd expected our first quarter sales to be down about 5%. We actually came in a little bit better than that. And then the ForEx impact of down 2%. 
Really strong segment margins, exactly in line with what we had outlined in terms of our guidance. And when you exclude the restructuring costs that are part of our 3-year restructuring program, margins were actually 15.1%, really quite strong for our business mix in the first quarter. 
Very pleased with our cash flow in the first quarter, $371 million. We're able to purchase back $100 million. You'll recall our full year plan is a $700 million buyback. And then we announced the dividend increase, the 4% increase in February. 
If we move on to Page 4, just a comparison to our guidance. Pretty simple. Higher revenue than we expected, primarily organic, a little bit FX for $0.02. And then we did spend a little bit less than we had anticipated. We had shared with you that we were going to spend on the order of $70 million in the first quarter for restructuring expense. That total came in closer to $63 million. So that contributed about $0.01. As I'll mention in just a couple of minutes, we do expect to spend those dollars later in the year, and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that. But overall, $0.88, a great start for the year. 
Turning to Page 5. I think you saw most of these numbers in the press release. I would remind you that our fourth quarter volume, fourth quarter 2015, was $5.057 billion, and so as you can see, came off just a little bit less than the 5% we had guided to. 
Our organic growth in the fourth quarter was 4%. Here in the first quarter, it was a negative 6%. We anticipate this is the worst quarter in terms of the year-over-year. You know that our full year guidance is a negative 2% to a negative 4%. Clearly, the comparisons in the second half get quite a bit easier than they are here in the first part of the year.
If we could flip to the individual segments now and we'll start with the Electrical Products segment. You find that on Page 6 of the packet. Clearly, a very good quarter. A number of you had commented on that already this morning that we're very pleased with the 16.1% operating margins, 17.1% without restructuring costs. 
If you look at our organic sales growth, it was 0 or flat this quarter. It was a negative 1% last quarter. And we're encouraged that our bookings in the first quarter were 2%. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, they were negative 1% and they were flat in the first -- in the third quarter of last year. So a little bit of an acceleration. 
And as you look around the world, and I'm sure you're all interested in terms of trying to understand sort of the tenor of the business and where the strength and weaknesses around the world, the U.S. continues to be stronger than that average of 2%. We're very pleased with what we saw. EMEA began to tick up a little bit, and I think that's in line with what you saw in some of the releases last night, earlier this morning about more economic strength in the European region. 
The weakness continues to be in Asia, where we've seen double-digit downs in Asia. And I think not only us but you've heard from other companies, conditions in Asia continue to be quite weak. Among the individual products, we had talked to you that generally, the theme that we've been seeing over the last 9 months has been weaknesses in industrial markets, more strength in residential and nonresidential construction. We actually had a very good quarter in our single-phase power quality, and I'll comment when we get to Systems and Services we also did in our 3-phase in that area. 
If we flip to the next chart please, which is Chart 7, Electrical Systems & Services segment. The volume of $1.342 billion, down about 10% from the fourth quarter. You remember the fourth quarter was $1.494 billion. And I think as we've told you, a good way to think about this segment in terms of shipment and prospective shipment volumes is to look at bookings. And so bookings were down 2% this quarter. You'll recall in the fourth quarter, they were also down 2%. In the third quarter, they were down 3%. 
So we continue to see weakness here, and a number of it traces to some of the macros that we've all discussed. Our Crouse-Hinds business that has a significant oil and gas exposure is in this segment. Some of the large industrial projects that we would tend to work on are in this area. We continue to see those weak as well. And so that as we continue to look to the year, I'll talk to you a little bit about segment margins.
We started off a little lower than we'd anticipated we might. That's why we've revised our margins for the year. I'll comment more on that as we get to the next couple charts. Within the regional area, again, the U.S. and EMEA being the stronger areas, the far weaker areas being Asia Pacific at this point, so a common theme, and you'll year that in the number of our businesses. 
Moving to the next chart, Chart #8 or Page 8, our Hydraulics segment. Sales of $551 million, virtually flat with what we saw in the fourth quarter. You remember it was $552 million at that point. You'll see the operating margins of 7.4%. And when you exclude the restructuring 10.3%, obviously we're doing a lot of work in this segment as we had shared with you and as Craig and his team had outlined at our February New York analyst meeting. 
The organic sales down some 14%. You'll recall they were down 12% in the fourth quarter. Bookings down some 10%. And here, we saw weakness in the U.S. as well as in Asia Pacific. I don't think the story is much different here in terms of our seeing weakness both on the distributor and on the OEM side. And we've seen weakness both on the stationary and the mobile side.
So to the question, have we bottomed in our Hydraulic end markets, we don't have the visibility to see that it has bottomed at this point. We're comfortable, and we shared with you some revised views of market growth in this area. And so our plan is very much the same, to continue to restructure this business during 2016 and not to count on a upturn in terms of volume.
Turning to Page #9, our Aerospace segment. Volume's up just slightly from the fourth quarter, down from a year ago but really terrific, terrific results in terms of our operating margins, 18% in the quarter. 18.9% without the restructuring. Very solid second quarter in a row. Bookings up 6%. 
Our aftermarket was down in this particular quarter, but we really believe that's much more of an issue of having had a very large quarter of aftermarket bookings in the first quarter 2015. And so we don't think this is a trend. We think it's really much more of a comparable issue. Organic growth was down 3%. Obviously, it was -- excuse me, it was a positive in the fourth quarter of about 2%, so a little lower growth but really strong margins and strong bookings.
If we turn to Page 10, our Vehicle segment. Clearly, we're beginning to see some of the impact of our original forecast of the North American heavy-duty truck market coming down to 250,000. We've actually not changed our full year forecast of it coming down to 230,000 units. We had a first quarter that was relatively strong but -- and we can talk more in the Q&A. 
As we've seen production schedules and orders progress into this year, it's our sense that this market's going to be closer to the 230,000 range than the 250,000 range. All this is already in our guidance. Strong margin performance. You see the organic sales down some 13%. You'll recall they were down 6% in the fourth quarter as we began to see this kind of rollover, if you will, in the heavy-duty market. 
If we move to the next page, Page 11. No change in terms of our view of total organic revenues for this year. Still we believe they'll come down 2% to 4%, obviously, with the first quarter of down 6%. This does anticipate and we do believe that we'll see much better comparisons as the year come on, so this kind of center point of a negative 3%. 
As we looked at our first quarter experience and our update of looking at individual markets, you'll see 2 changes on this page from the guidance we provided you earlier this year. We've raised the guidance in terms of organic growth in Electrical Products, a great first quarter. Residential markets saw stronger than we had originally anticipated. Those being the 2 big contributors to our increasing our guidance for Electrical Products. 
Then in the Vehicle markets, really 2 changes there that the North American heavy-duty markets, I mentioned to you, would be down at about 230,000 units of production versus the 250,000 we had originally anticipated. So that's about a 29% reduction, the 230,000 over last year. 
And then Latin America continues to be weak, and clearly, we all are, I think, up-to-date with the tremendous problems in Brazil currently met and nothing but weaker markets further. And so those really being the 2 changes within the Vehicle market. Overall still 2% to 4%. 
A quick update on our restructuring actions on Page 12. You'll recall again a 3-year program. The work that's going on by teams all across the company really well done, keeping very much to our schedules. We did, as I mentioned in my original comments this morning, we incurred about $63 million of restructuring expense versus the guidance we had provided you of roughly $70 million. 
We really have -- that expense of that $7 million will move out to the second half. We've got one project that's really moved from Q1 to Q3, but overall, we think that we will still be at about $140 million of restructuring cost. And as you look at that $42 million in the second half, just to give you some sense for pacing, we think about 70% roughly of that is likely to be in the third quarter, with the remaining roughly 30% would be in the fourth quarter.  
Importantly, our overall year-to-year incremental annual benefits of $185 million remain unchanged. Some of you may ask, how can you have a project move out and it doesn't change your overall benefits? Remember, that these incremental $185 million of savings included both carryover benefits from actions we had taken last year in 2015 as well as the new actions we've taken in 2016. It was in that overall mix, obviously, our projects moving ahead and back and quite a lot of activity. Overall though, we're very comfortable with the $185 million still that's being realized here in 2016.
On Page 13 titled Segment Operating Margins Expectations, I've mentioned to you we'd made a couple of changes here that relate to changes, really what's going on in the market again. Our Electrical Products, as you can see, we've moved our guidance up to 17.4% to 18.0% for margins after the very strong first quarter that we've had. You'll recall it was 17.0% to 17.6%.
In our Electrical Systems & Services, we've moved down to 13.1% to 13.7%. It previously had been 13.7% to 14.3%. Really just a couple of items driving that. A little bigger commercial mix, a little weaker industrial mix and continued pressure in the oil and gas markets. 
No change in Hydraulics, no change in Aerospace. And then our Vehicle business, we've moved it down to 16.2% to 16.8%. It was 16.7% to 17.3%. And that's really the impact of the 230,000-unit production for NAFTA heavy-duty Class 8 versus our earlier forecast of 250,000.
Looking ahead to the second quarter after what we think is a very solid and good start to the year in the first quarter, Page 14, it's entitled EPS Guidance. Second quarter, our guidance is the range of $1 to $1.10 operating EPS, and it's virtually the same as net income because we don't have acquisition restructuring expense. 
Organic revenue sequentially moving up 5% from Q1 2016 to Q2 2016. As we've talked in the last couple of years, that is a pretty normal seasonal for us, the 5% step-up from the first quarter to the second quarter. The first quarter is always our weakest quarter in terms of revenue. 
And then we would expect as FX is turning out to be less than we had forecast earlier this year, that we would expect we'll get about 1 point bump up from ForEx, too. So likely revenue is up on the order of 6%. Segment margins, including all the restructuring expense and the restructuring benefits as well as the incremental on the higher volume in the second quarter between 15% to 16%, and a tax rate that'll be between 10% to 12%. Our guidance for the year remains unchanged, and each of the comments underneath the guidance on this page are the same that you saw from us in our first quarter guidance. So no change there as well.
And if we move to Page 15, the 2016 Outlook Summary. Again, only changes that you find on this page or really no changes on this page. We've just had some change on what I call the mix under a couple of these numbers. Once again, the operating EPS for this year is flat with a year ago. And then the net income per share is up some 2%.
So if you move to Page 16, a quick summary of our report today. Again, we think a really strong start to the year, solid first quarter. Record first quarter cash flow and continuing to buy back shares as well as obviously have a dividend increase. 2016, as I mentioned earlier, we really don't see the year much differently than we did when we laid out the guidance for this year and laid out our operating plan. And that's why we're continuing to work on our $400 million restructuring plan and the $3 billion share buyback plan because I think they're exactly what's needed during a period of this type of economic weakness. 
We've tuned 2 things within 2016: one is the modestly weaker NAFTA heavy-duty production forecast, and the second is that we think ForEx is now likely to be -- impact our revenues by a negative $200 million versus the original negative $400 million. I'm sure we'll have questions about why our EPS full year guidance hasn't changed. And a very easy way to think about this is roughly the reduction in the ForEx, a negative impact on sales and profit basically offsets the lower market expectation now for the NAFTA heavy-duty truck forecast. 
Our restructuring program, just full of good news here. It continues to be very much as we thought, being able to realize the potential. Our teams are really creating great results around the world, and our full year incremental benefits remain unchanged at $185 million, and the cost remain unchanged at $140 million. And as I said several times already this morning, our capital allocation plan to buy back the $700 million shares following the $682 million that we bought back last year remains unchanged.
So with that, Don, I'll turn things back to you."

And it has helped that what we've seen over the last couple of years as we've seen strength in these areas in the U.S. that hadn't seen much strength in Europe in that regard. And Europe's had a far better quarter in that regard as well. So I would point to those as being the areas of real strength. The areas that have offset because you look at 2% and say that's not the kind of growth we were seeing a couple of years ago, have been still the industrial markets, so that's both industrial MRO and industrial OEM, continue to be the weak spots. And so we see that in a number of our product suite we sell directly into those markets."

But you know actually, Julian, the big change for us in vehicle this year really is centered largely on North America Class 8 truck. The other markets, by and large, are performing as we anticipated. The light-vehicle market in China is doing fine. Europe in light vehicles is doing well. And as you probably saw on some of the data, we're not a big player, but the truck market in Europe is still doing well. Yes, we had some perhaps a little bit of another leg down in South America, but at this point, the denominator is so small that it really doesn't matter a lot. It's a -- really, it's a function of the North America Class 8 market. And coming into the year, we have a 250,000 number out there for the market, which was, quite frankly, one of the weaker numbers of anybody forecasting the market. And coming into the earlier part of this year, it appears that we have about 20,000 units of inventory overhang that's fundamentally affecting the North America Class 8 market. If you take a look at ATA  truck tonnage or some of the key markets that are the indicators for those markets longer term, those markets are doing okay. And so we really think we're going through a bit of an inventory correction right now in North America Class 8, and that's principally the reason we've reduced our forecast. And at 230,000, we think once again, we have one of the more conservative numbers out there. So at this juncture, we think we're well positioned in terms of the year, and so we don't think this is going to be a case of every quarter another downward revision."

There is a portion of that business that does come in during the quarter and go out. And that's the piece that's a little harder for us to forecast. And in some cases, that is MRO for the oil and gas area. And so that's an area it' a little harder for us to look ahead. I think we entered this year thinking oil and gas would be down on the basis of 15%. It's every bit of that. Whether it turns out to be more than that, I guess we'll know come year-end. But even though we've seen oil move up to the mid-$40s, that segment's just not investing right now. And they're still very much in a cutting back mode at this point. It's going to take some time before we see that start to come back in the other direction. And to the other issue for us to keep an eye on here is whether we start to see confidence in and around reinvestment in industrial projects, and we've really not seen that to-date. And we think that's likely to take more time as well. You're right that the pricing of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. because most of our production is in the U.S. that we serve Canada with.

So no, we're not seeing strengthening on the industrial side and either the MRO or the user side. I think you've seen that parallel in the number of our peers who've reported quite recently. And their big weakness has been on the industrial side, both user and OEM, and it's been on the large industrial project side whereas the strength has been more over in the construction side, particularly light construction and residential."

Thanks for joining us. I'll be working again from the presentation that was posted earlier this morning. And why don't we turn to Page 3? It's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results.

And why don't we turn to Page 3? It's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results. I think as you saw from our earnings release, our quarter was slightly ahead of our original expectations, coming in, in the upper half of our range. It positions us very much on plan for our full year guidance. And really not much has changed in terms of our view of either how markets will progress this year, how we're seeing the economy nor how we see our prospects for this year.
You saw the operating earning per share were $0.88. Our sales of $4.8 million (sic) [billion] were down 8% from a year ago. Organic revenue was down 6%. You may recall that compared to the fourth quarter, we had said that we'd expected our first quarter sales to be down about 5%. We actually came in a little bit better than that. And then the ForEx impact of down 2%. 
Really strong segment margins, exactly in line with what we had outlined in terms of our guidance. And when you exclude the restructuring costs that are part of our 3-year restructuring program, margins were actually 15.1%, really quite strong for our business mix in the first quarter. 
Very pleased with our cash flow in the first quarter, $371 million. We were able to purchase back $100 million. You'll recall our full year plan is a $700 million buyback. And then we announced the dividend increase, the 4% increase in February. 
If you move on to Page 4, just a comparison to our guidance. Pretty simple. Higher revenue than we expected, primarily organic, a little bit FX for $0.02. And then we did spend a little bit less than we had anticipated. And we had shared with you that we were going to spend on the order of $70 million in the first quarter for restructuring expense. That total came in closer to $63 million. So that contributed about $0.01. As I'll mention in just a couple of minutes, we do expect to spend those dollars later in the year, and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that. But overall, $0.88, a great start for the year. 
Turning to Page 5. I think you saw most of these numbers in the press release. I would remind you that our fourth quarter volume, fourth quarter 2015, was $5.057 billion, and so as you can see, came off just a little bit less than the 5% we had guided to. 
Our organic growth in the fourth quarter was 4%. Here in the first quarter, it was a negative 6%. We anticipate this is the worst quarter in terms of the year-over-year. You know that our full year guidance is a negative 2% to a negative 4%. Clearly, the comparisons in the second half get quite a bit easier than they are here in the first part of the year.
If we could flip to the individual segments now, and we'll start with the Electrical Products segment. You find that on Page 6 of the packet. Clearly, a very good quarter. A number of you had commented on that already this morning that we're very pleased with the 16.1% operating margins, 17.1% without restructuring costs. 
If you look at our organic sales growth, it was 0 or flat this quarter. It was a negative 1% last quarter. And we're encouraged that our bookings in the first quarter were 2%. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, they were negative 1% and they were flat in the first -- in the third quarter of last year. So a little bit of an acceleration. 
And as you look around the world, and I'm sure you're all interested in terms of trying to understand sort of the tenor of the business and where the strength and weakness is around the world, the U.S. continues to be stronger than that average of 2%. We're very pleased with what we saw. EMEA began to tick up a little bit, and I think that's in line with what you saw in some of the releases last night, earlier this morning about more economic strength in the European region. 
The weakness continues to be in Asia, where we've seen double-digit downs in Asia. And I think not only us but you've heard from other companies, conditions in Asia continue to be quite weak. Among the individual products, we had talked to you that generally, the theme that we've been seeing over the last 9 months has been weaknesses in industrial markets, more strength in residential and nonresidential construction. We actually had a very good quarter in our single-phase power quality, and I'll comment when we get to Systems and Services we also did in our 3-phase in that area. 
If we flip to the next chart please, which is Chart 7, Electrical Systems & Services segment. The volume of $1.342 billion, down about 10% from the fourth quarter. You remember the fourth quarter was $1.494 billion. And I think as we've told you, a good way to think about this segment in terms of shipment and prospective shipment volumes is to look at bookings. And so bookings were down 2% this quarter. You'll recall in the fourth quarter, they were also down 2%. In the third quarter, they were down 3%. 
So we continue to see weakness here, and a number of it traces to some of the macros that we've all discussed. Our Crouse-Hinds business that has a significant oil and gas exposure is in this segment. Some of the large industrial projects that we would tend to work on are in this area. We continue to see those weak as well. And so that as we continue to look to the year, I'll talk to you a little bit about segment margins.
We started off a little lower than we'd anticipated we might. That's why we've revised our margins for the year. I'll comment more on that as we get to the next couple charts. Within the regional area, again, the U.S. and EMEA being the stronger areas, the far weaker areas being Asia Pacific at this point, so a common theme, and you'll year that in the number of our businesses. 
Moving to the next chart, Chart #8 or Page 8, our Hydraulics segment. Sales of $551 million, virtually flat with what we saw in the fourth quarter. You remember it was $552 million at that point. You'll see the operating margins of 7.4%. And when you exclude the restructuring 10.3%, obviously we're doing a lot of work in this segment as we had shared with you and as Craig and his team had outlined at our February New York analyst meeting. 
The organic sales down some 14%. You'll recall they were down 12% in the fourth quarter. Bookings down some 10%. And here, we saw weakness in the U.S. as well as in Asia Pacific. I don't think the story is much different here in terms of our seeing weakness both on the distributor and on the OEM side. And we've seen weakness both on the stationary and the mobile side.
So to the question, have we bottomed in our Hydraulic end markets? We don't have the visibility to see that it has bottomed at this point. We're comfortable, and we shared with you some revised views of market growth in this area. And so our plan is very much the same, to continue to restructure this business during 2016 and not to count on a upturn in terms of volume.
Turning to Page #9, our Aerospace segment. Volume's up just slightly from the fourth quarter, down from a year ago but really terrific, terrific results in terms of our operating margins, 18% in the quarter. 18.9% without the restructuring. Very solid second quarter in a row. Bookings up 6%. 
Our aftermarket was down in this particular quarter, but we really believe that's much more of an issue of having had a very large quarter of aftermarket bookings in the first quarter of 2015. And so we don't think this is a trend. We think it's really much more of a comparable issue. Organic growth was down 3%. Obviously, it was -- excuse me, it was a positive in the fourth quarter of about 2%, so a little lower growth but really strong margins and strong bookings.
If we turn to Page 10, our Vehicle segment. Clearly, we're beginning to see some of the impact of our original forecast of the North American heavy-duty truck market coming down to 250,000. We've actually not changed our full year forecast of it coming down to 230,000 units. We had a first quarter that was relatively strong but -- and we can talk more in the Q&A. 
As we've seen production schedules and orders progress into this year, it's our sense that this market's going to be closer to the 230,000 range than the 250,000 range. All this is already in our guidance. Strong margin performance. You see the organic sales down some 13%. You'll recall they were down 6% in the fourth quarter as we began to see this kind of rollover, if you will, in the heavy-duty market. 
If we move to the next page, Page 11. No change in terms of our view of total organic revenues for this year. Still we believe they'll come down 2% to 4%, obviously, with the first quarter of down 6%. This does anticipate and we do believe that we'll see much better comparisons as the year come on, so this kind of center point of a negative 3%. 
As we looked at our first quarter experience and our update of looking at individual markets, you'll see 2 changes on this page from the guidance we provided you earlier this year. We've raised the guidance in terms of organic growth in Electrical Products, a great first quarter. Residential markets saw stronger than we had originally anticipated. Those being the 2 big contributors to our increasing our guidance for Electrical Products. 
Then in the Vehicle markets, really 2 changes there that the North American heavy-duty markets, I mentioned to you, would be down at about 230,000 units of production versus the 250,000 we had originally anticipated. So that's about a 29% reduction, the 230,000 over last year. 
And then Latin America continues to be weak, and clearly, we all are, I think, up-to-date with the tremendous problems in Brazil currently met and nothing but weaker markets further. And so those really being the 2 changes within the Vehicle market. Overall still 2% to 4%. 
A quick update on our restructuring actions on Page 12. You'll recall again a 3-year program. The work that's going on by teams all across the company really well done, keeping very much to our schedules. We did, as I mentioned in my original comments this morning, we incurred about $63 million of restructuring expense versus the guidance we had provided you of roughly $70 million. 
We really have -- that, that expense of that $7 million will move out to the second half. We've got one project that's really moved from Q1 to Q3, but overall, we think that we will still be at about $140 million through restructuring cost. And as you look at that $42 million in the second half, just to give you some sense for pacing, we think about 70% roughly of that is likely to be in the third quarter, with the remaining roughly 30% would be in the fourth quarter.  
Importantly, our overall year-to-year incremental annual benefits of $185 million remain unchanged. Some of you may ask, how can you have a project move out and it doesn't change your overall benefits? Remember, that these incremental $185 million of savings included both carryover benefits from actions we had taken last year in 2015 as well as the new actions we've taken in 2016. It was in that overall mix, obviously, our projects moving ahead and back and quite a lot of activity. Overall though, we're very comfortable with the $185 million still that's being realized here in 2016.
On Page 13, it's titled Segment Operating Margins Expectations, I've mentioned to you we'd made a couple of changes here that relate to changes, really what's going on in the market again. Our Electrical Products, as you can see, we've moved our guidance up to 17.4% to 18.0% for margins after the very strong first quarter that we've had. You'll recall it was 17.0% to 17.6%.
In our Electrical Systems & Services, we've moved down to 13.1% to 13.7%. It previously had been 13.7% to 14.3%. Really just a couple of items driving that. A little bigger commercial mix, a little weaker industrial mix and continued pressure in the oil and gas markets. 
No change in Hydraulics, no change in Aerospace. And then our Vehicle business, we've moved it down to 16.2% to 16.8%. It was 16.7% to 17.3%. And that's really the impact of the 230,000-unit production for NAFTA heavy-duty Class 8 versus our earlier forecast of 250,000.
Looking ahead to the second quarter after what we think is a very solid and good start to the year in the first quarter, Page 14, it's entitled EPS Guidance. Second quarter, our guidance is the range of $1 to $1.10 operating EPS, and it's virtually the same as net income because we don't have acquisition restructuring expense. 
Organic revenue sequentially moving up 5% from Q1 2016 to Q2 2016. As we've talked in the last couple of years, that is a pretty normal seasonal for us, is that the 5% step-up from the first quarter to the second quarter. The first quarter is always our weakest quarter in terms of revenue. 
And then we would expect as FX is turning out to be less than we had forecast earlier this year, that we would expect we'll get about 1 point bump up from ForEx, too. So likely revenue is up on the order of 6%. Segment margins, including all the restructuring expense and the restructuring benefits as well as the incremental on the higher volume in the second quarter between 15% to 16%, and a tax rate that'll be between 10% to 12%. Our guidance for the year remains unchanged, and each of the comments underneath the guidance on this page are the same that you saw from us in our first quarter guidance. So no change there as well.
And if we move to Page 15, the 2016 Outlook Summary. Again, only changes that you find on this page or really no changes on this page. We've just had some change on what I call the mix under a couple of these numbers. Once again, the operating EPS for this year is flat with a year ago. And then the net income per share is up some 2%.
So if you move to Page 16, a quick summary of our report today. Again, we think a really strong start to the year, solid first quarter. Record first quarter cash flow and continuing to buy back shares as well as obviously have a dividend increase. 2016, as I mentioned earlier, we really don't see the year much differently than we did when we laid out the guidance for this year and laid out our operating plan. And that's why we're continuing to work on our $400 million restructuring plan and the $3 billion share buyback plan because I think they're exactly what's needed during a period of this type of economic weakness. 
We've tuned 2 things within 2016: one is the modestly weaker NAFTA heavy-duty production forecast, and the second is that we think ForEx is now likely to be -- impact our revenues by a negative $200 million versus the original negative $400 million. I'm sure we'll have questions about why our EPS full year guidance hasn't changed. And a very easy way to think about this is roughly the reduction in the ForEx, a negative impact on sales and profit basically offsets the lower market expectation now for the NAFTA heavy-duty truck forecast. 
Our restructuring program, just full of good news here. It continues to be very much as we thought, being able to realize the potential. Our teams are really creating great results around the world, and our full year incremental benefits remain unchanged at $185 million, and the cost remain unchanged at $140 million. And as I said several times already this morning, our capital allocation plan to buy back the $700 million shares following the $682 million that we bought back last year remains unchanged.

And it has helped that what we've seen over the last couple of years as we've seen strength in these areas in the U.S. that hadn't seen much strength in Europe in that regard. And Europe's had a far better quarter in that regard as well. So I would point to those as being the areas of real strength. The areas that have offset it because you look at 2% and say that's not the kind of growth we were seeing a couple of years ago, have been at still the industrial markets, so that's both industrial MRO and industrial OEM, continue to be the weak spots.

The other markets, by and large, are performing as we anticipated. The light-vehicle market in China is doing fine. Europe in light vehicles is doing well. And as you probably saw on some of the data, we're not a big player, but the truck market in Europe is still doing well. Yes, we had some perhaps a little bit of another leg down in South America, but at this point, the denominator is so small that it really doesn't matter a lot. It's a -- really, it's a function of the North America Class 8 market. And coming into the year, we have a 250,000 number out there for the market, which was, quite frankly, one of the weaker numbers of anybody forecasting the market. And coming into the earlier part of this year, it appears that we have about 20,000 units of inventory overhang that's fundamentally affecting the North America Class 8 market. If you take a look at ATA truck tonnage or some of the key markets that are the indicators for those markets longer term, those markets are doing okay. And so we really think we're going through a bit of an inventory correction right now in North America Class 8, and that's principally the reason we've reduced our forecast. And at 230,000, we think once again, we have one of the more conservative numbers out there. So at this juncture, we think we're well positioned in terms of the year, and so we don't think this is going to be a case of every quarter another downward revision."

And if I go back to the comments that we made right at the beginning of the call is that we see the year laying out very much as we did. A number of you felt we were conservative in terms of our economic outlook for this year. But when we see U.S. GDP coming at the kind of numbers it did the other day, we think it's more confirmation that this is likely to be a slow growth year on the industrial side.

There is a portion of that business that does come in during the quarter and go out. And that's the piece that's a little harder for us to forecast. And in some cases, that is MRO for the oil and gas area. And so that's an area it's a little harder for us to look ahead. I think we entered this year thinking oil and gas would be down on the basis of 15%. It's every bit of that. Whether it turns out to be more than that, I guess we'll know come year-end. But even though we've seen oil move up to the mid-$40s, that segment's just not investing right now. And they're still very much in a cutting back mode at this point. It's going to take some time before we see that start to come back in the other direction. I'd say the other issue for us to keep an eye on here is whether we start to see confidence in and around reinvestment in industrial projects, and we've really not seen that to-date. And we think that's likely to take more time as well. You're right that the pricing of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. because most of our production is in the U.S. that we serve Canada with. It did hurt us last year. If it stays on a sustained basis, and that's the key here, that will start to help us from a margin perspective."

I'm sure you've all had an opportunity to work through the material, and so I'll hit a few of the highlight and add a bit of color to the results. Operating earnings per share, we're really pleased with the quarter at $1.07, $0.02 ahead",2293,"Okay. Thanks, Don. I'm sure you've all had an opportunity to work through the material, and so I'll hit a few of the highlight and add a bit of color to the results. Operating earnings per share, we're really pleased with the quarter at $1.07, $0.02 ahead of our guidance. As we anticipated, sales in the quarter came in at $5.1 billion, down 5% organically -- down 5%. Organic revenue down some 4%. And this is really consistent with the normal patterns that we see, Q2 sales at 5% above Q1, and quite frankly, FX was a little better, 1% better than it was in Q1 as well. 
Segment operating profits came in at 15.4% versus our guidance of between 15% and 16%. And I'd say particularly strong margins in Electrical Products as well as in Aerospace, both of which came in at 18.6% when you exclude some of the restructuring charges and offsetting a bit of weakness in Electrical Systems & Services. 
Restructuring costs in the quarter came in right as expected at $35 million and reducing our margin by some 60 basis points. Adjusting for restructuring cost and FX, really strong decremental performance by the company over all in each of our businesses. And we're really pleased with the fact that we had record cash flow in Q2 with cash conversion of 124% of net income, so really strong cash performance in the quarter. We also repurchased some $225 million of our stocks back and 3.7 million shares in the quarter. 
Turning to the financial summary. We continue to see weakness in a number of our end markets versus 2015. But sequentially, revenues were up some, as I mentioned, 6% from Q1. Organic revenue declined and FX headwinds are decelerating. Organic revenue is down some 6% from Q1. But -- in Q1, but only 4% in Q2. And as I mentioned, FX also mitigating a little bit, down 1% in Q2 versus 2% in Q1. 
Margin, excluding restructuring costs, were some 16%. That's up 90 basis points from Q1 and an improvement over Q2 of '15 by some 10 basis points. And this is despite some 4% weaker organic revenue. So a real indication that we're getting and we're holding onto our restructuring benefits that we're engaging in across the company.
Turning our attention to Electrical Products segment, a really strong quarter of execution in this business. We're pleased with the Q2 results and we think strong overall performance that we continue to see in this business. Modest year-on-year organic growth, up some 1% offset by FX. But an acceleration sequentially with revenues up some 10% from Q1. We continue to see strong execution in the business, as evidenced by the significant margin improvement. Excluding restructuring, our operating margins were up some 270 basis points and 150 basis points better than Q1. 
Bookings were down 2% in the quarter on weakness in the Americas industrial markets and really broad-based weakness in the Asia Pacific region. We did continue to see strength in U.S. regional housing, in the lighting markets and in Europe, generally. 
Looking at Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were up some 6% from Q1 but 5% worse than Q2 2015. Margins were weaker in Q2 2015 on less favorable mix of project and also on the impact of a litigation charge that we actually took in this particular business that reduced margins by some 70 basis points. So note, margins, excluding restructuring costs, were in fact, flat with Q1. 
While somewhat offset by lower commodity prices, the pricing environment in this business does continue to be somewhat difficult. And as we characterized kind of the net between the 2, we'd say slightly negative on a net commodity cost basis but certainly manageable and well within our guidance. 
Bookings are down some 2%, and we're seeing continued weakness here in large industrial projects, weakness in Canada, in oil and gas markets, partially offset by strength in the 3-phase UPS, principally in data centers. Light commercial orders continue to be strong, as well as the service business. 
In looking at Hydraulics. Hydraulics market -- I'd say they appear to be stabilizing, but more importantly, I think our team is executing well here. Organic revenues are up some 7% from Q1 but down 7% from last year. 10% margins in the quarter, but I think importantly, 13% when you exclude restructuring costs. And we think real proof point that -- the restructuring work that's being undertaken in the business delivering the margin improvement is really coming through. So x restructuring costs, profits were essentially flat on 7% lower organic revenue growth, and so we think really strong performance. 
Bookings declined some 2% in the quarter, really the best quarter that we've seen in bookings in the last 2 years. On particular, strength in EMEA and positive bookings in Asia, with some modest weakness continuing in the Americas. 
In the quarter, OEM orders were down 4%. Distribution orders were down 1%. And really, the area of greatest weakness in the business continues to be on the stationary side of the business where we have orders were down, in some cases, up to 33%. We did see strength in the quarter in ag, up 23%. Not sure how much of a retro that is on the total years, we continue to see some concerns there. And construction orders in the quarter were up some 8%. 
In Aerospace, we think a strong operating result in the quarter. Organic revenues were flat with Q2 '15 principally on lower military OEM sales, offset by strength in both large commercial transport and in aftermarket. Margins were once again very strong at 18.6%, up some 160 basis points over Q2 '15. Bookings were down 1% in the quarter. And this is on particular weakness in the BizJet segment, which is a little bit of some surprised weakness for us. But when you adjust for our weakness in BizJet, bookings were up mid-single digits, and aftermarket orders continue to be strong, up some 7%. We also continue to see strength in commercial transport segment where we saw orders up some 10% in the quarter. 
In looking at Vehicles. Organic revenues were down 14% versus Q2 '15, driven primarily by the 29% decline in Class 8 market and continued double-digit market declines that we're seeing in the Brazilian market. Outside of Brazil, passenger car markets continue to hold up at very high levels, and we expect markets in North America to be flat with modest growth in EMEA and in Asia. 
Margins, when you exclude restructuring costs, were down some 230 basis points versus 2015 but up 70 basis points versus Q1. So we think with or without restructuring costs, we think strong operating performance in this business, and where you're really dealing with some pretty significant headwinds in terms of the Class 8 market and what's happening in Brazil in general.
If we turn to the organic growth outlook for the year, maybe I'll spend a few extra minutes on this slide, just to give you some color on the way we see the year unfolding. In general, we think markets on balance are performing as we expected. But we do expect the market to remain sluggish throughout the balance of the year. 
And looking at Electrical Products. We'd say here, a really mix story in terms of what's going on in our end markets. We see growth in residential and lighting in the U.S. Growth in Europe. But we continue to see declines in industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and in Asia. More specifically, we're seeing growth in U.S. residential markets, we think growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're seeing growth in the U.S. lighting market, which we'd say is mid-single digit. And we see growth in Europe, and we think Europe, EMEA growth some 2% to 3%. And this is offset by weakness in U.S. industrial markets, which we think will be down mid-single digit; weakness in Canada, which we think is down low single digit; and continued weakness in the Asia Pacific region, which we think is also down low single-digit range. 
In Electrical Systems & Services. We continue to see declines in large industrial projects, in oil and gas but some grows in 3-phase and power quality in the U.S. market and in Europe, with modest growth in power systems. More specifically, we see U.S. and the EMEA 3-phase part quality up low single digit. We see some real weakness in harsh and hazardous. We think down some 15% for the year. We think some industrial projects continue to be down. And light commercial continues to be a source of strength in the business. And once again, Asia Pac, we think will be down low to mid-single digits for the year. 
Turning our attention to Hydraulics, and certainly, we had a relatively speaking stronger quarter in Hydraulics. And we think, in many ways, this is really a function of easier comps as we move forward during the course of 2016. We continue to see weakness in mobile, particularly in ag equipment. We see certainly continued weakness in oil and gas equipment market. Double-digit declines in China construction. So our core on the hydraulics markets really has not changed materially from the way we originally saw the year. 
In Aerospace. We're seeing low single-digit growth in commercial OE and in commercial aftermarket, offset by, as I mentioned earlier, some pretty significant declines in the BizJet segment, which really took orders down in Q2. Some small declines in U.S. defense OEM and some modest growth in defense aftermarket. 
In Vehicle. As we noted, and after Class 8, we think 230,000 units this year, down some 29%. And we continue to see weakness in the Brazilian truck and bus market, we think down 20% for the year, offset by low single-digit growth in NAFTA classics production and some modest growth, as I mentioned, in the light vehicle markets around the world.
If we turn our attention to restructuring, really good news here. Restructuring programs remain on track. Q2 spending came in right at plan at $35 million, and our projects are clearly on track and we have great line of sight to delivering the benefits that we laid out. 
We did increase our second half spending by $5 million, primarily in Electrical Systems & Service to deal with some of the continued weakness that we're seeing in some of our markets, principally oil and gas and industrial markets. We expect to spend $27 million in Q3 and another $20 million in Q4, increasing our total spending for the year to $145 million. But we've also increased our annual benefits by $5 million, and so really no net change in benefits for the year. So in total, we now expect the program to cost $404 million in total, with benefits of $223 million, both up $5 million from prior forecast.
Turning our attention to the segment margin expectations, not much in the way of change here. Over all, on a consolidated basis, unchanged from prior guidance. However, we did make a minor adjustment in guidance for both Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. The ES&S down some 30 basis points on continued weakness, principally in the higher-margin oil and gas and industrial projects and Aerospace up some 30 basis points on the basis of ongoing strength in aftermarket, and really tight control in developing costs inside of the business. Each of the other businesses are expected to be within the ranges noted. And you'll recall that these guidance numbers do, in fact, include restructuring expenses. 
Turning our attention to EPS guidance. The guidance of Q3 reflects continuation of the current overall softness in a number of our end markets. We think organic revenues in Q3 and Q4 are essentially flat with Q2. Flat revenue, but the variances to last year will improve as a result of, as I mentioned earlier, easier comps. Margin expectations will be between 15.5% to 16.5%, reflecting lower restructuring expenses and increased benefits from Q2 and Q3. We think the tax rate will be 8% to 10% in Q3 versus 11% in Q2. And the midpoint of our guidance remains unchanged at $4.30, so we did in fact, narrowed the range by $0.05 in both the high side and the low side.
Turning our attention to the outlook for 2016, the summary table that we normally provide in these calls. Here, the key changes are, once again, we updated the Q3 guidance, $1.10 to $1.20. A slight increase in foreign exchange negative benefits by $25 million. And as I mentioned before, simply narrowing the range about holding the guidance at $4.30. 
So in summary, we think really a strong quarter in Q2. The teams are executing extraordinarily well. Revenues came in more or less as expected, with strong performance in Electrical Products and Aerospace, offsetting some of the weakness that we've seeing in Electrical Systems & Services. And Hydraulics really showing strong margin improvement, excluding restructuring charges in the quarter. And once again, really importantly, record cash flow as the businesses are really doing a nice job of converting net income to cash. 
We remain committed to our $700 million of share repurchase. We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter, $225 million. Markets are unfolding as we expected. And full year outlook is unchanged, down 2% to 4%. And the restructuring programs are basically delivering $174 million of incremental profit in 2016 over '15, and it's setting up well for us to deliver another $120 million of incremental profits in 2017 over 2016. So I'll stop here and turn it back to Don, and we'll go to question-and-answer"

We had this legal settlement related to a 3-year commercial negotiation that ended up impacting the Electrical Systems & Services segment. And so that did take our margins down 70 basis points in the quarter and just commercial settlement from a prior matter. And in terms of the company's exposure to oil and gas, most of our exposure that's inside of the Electrical business is in the Electrical Systems & Services business. You recall that when we acquired Cooper, we also acquired a very large business called Crouse-Hinds that has a very big exposure to what we call harsh and hazardous markets, including oil and gas. And so we're certainly seeing an impact in that business, as well as in all of our businesses that are exposed to oil and gas. I'd say, in terms of the overall oil and gas market, I think at this junction, we'd say we certainly have not seen any improvement in oil and gas. And maybe we've seen a little bit of deceleration in oil and gas, not material changes from our original assumptions for the year, but clearly, we've not seen any indications that, that market has turned. And to your point around the second derivative and the other kind of markets that are tied to oil and gas, I think we really have been experiencing all year that second derivative impact. And so yes, it's oil and gas, but in many cases, oil and gas companies, whether it's upstream or downstream, they all live under one roof. Until we've seen kind of the other knock-on effects from oil and gas-related industries and already impact our business and is already reflected in our guidance."

But if we think about the entire year, we think we're largely on plan and on expectations. It's a little bit of uncertainty around what the future looks like around commodity prices as you read all the same press clippings that I do. And we have seen a little bit of an uptick in some commodities in the last 30 days. We've seen others tick down. So we think, largely speaking, that commodity prices for the full year will be very much in line with what our expectations were. We're not getting leverage right now in the business because were not, for the most part, growing volume.

I think what we've seen in almost every one of our businesses is relatively speaking versus our expectations for the year and all the geopolitical issues and everything else taking place in Europe, we've seen in Europe generally perform slightly better than what we anticipated. And so it really does run the gamut. Certainly, if you take a look at vehicle markets, and that's probably the big stand out this year. Light vehicle production and sales has been up mid-single digit all year, so we're seeing the real strength there. Hydraulics markets in Europe, while still negative, less negative than we anticipated. In fact, those markets we think down low single-digit this year, which is a better outlook than we anticipated. On the electrical side of the house, once again, we're seeing growth for the most part in many of our end markets in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems & Services. And we think those markets growth slightly this year. We think up once again low single-digit. So it's really, we'd say, been a broad-based kind of beep versus our internal expectations. Modest, but pretty broad. And that this point, it's too early to say follow up question may be in terms of what happened with Brexit and the Turkey matter, at this point, it's too early to say. On the positive side, we are today a net exporter out of the U.K. So we don't think that is going to have a big issue. And the same thing would be true out of Turkey.

A lot of that, driven by some of the duties that have been put on, imports coming out of China and that's had a knock-on effect of steel prices around the world. In the near term, we think we're fine. In terms of the net impact to the company, we do have -- we did some pre-buying, we do have some hedges in place. So we think in the near term, we have the ability to mitigate the impact of steel price increases. We'll have to wait and see how long these increases stay in effect, whether this is a short-term blip or it's a long-term flip. And in the event that's a longer-term impact, we'd have to actually revisit our pricing assumption and we find a way to pass it onto the marketplace. And so we think, once again, on balance, we'll do what we've always done in inflationary environments. We'll find a way to pass it onto the customer base. And I think it's well publicized, it's well understood, and so we don't think that poses a risk to our margins. To your point around auto weakness, we certainly have seen a lot of the reports, reading the same as what you have. We continue to take a very cautious view on the outlook for automotive markets. We think North America will be largely flat this year, and Europe and Asia will be up slightly. But like you, we're taking a very cautious turn -- view of it. We'll be getting prepared, in any event that we do have a downturn, we're going to be well prepared to deal with it. I will add that there's a number of economic forecasters who do have a view that's already out for 2017. And we're not sure if they're right or wrong. But whether it's IHS or some of the other economic forecasters, they think that the market essentially continue at these high levels on into 2017 that are essentially flat or maybe up 1% or so, 1% or 2%.

The second priority we said is, in fact, to ensure that we maintain a very strong dividend. The third priority we said was to buy back shares, especially in this environment. We think that our stock price is on sale. And we think we can create a lot of value by buying back our share. And then fourth priority would be to do M&A. And that prioritization has not changed and currently the way we would think about capital deployment."

Hey, I'm sure you've all had an opportunity to work through the material, and so I'll hit a few of the highlights and add a bit of color to the results. Operating earnings per share, we're really pleased with the results in the quarter at $1.07, $0.02 up, ahead of our guidance. And as we anticipated, sales in the quarter came in at $5.1 billion, down 5% organically -- down 5%, organic revenue down some 4%. And this is really consistent with the normal patterns that we see, Q2 sales at 5% above Q1, and quite frankly, FX was a little better, 1% better than it was in Q1 as well. 
Segment operating profits came in at 15.4% versus our guidance of between 15% and 16% and I'd say, with particularly strong margins in Electrical Products as well as in Aerospace, both of which came in at 18.6% when you exclude some of the restructuring charges, and offsetting a bit of weakness in Electrical Systems & Services. 
Restructuring costs in the quarter came in right as expected at $35 million and reducing our margin by some 60 basis points. Adjusting for restructuring costs and FX, really strong decremental performance by the company overall in each of our businesses. And we're really pleased with the fact that we had record cash flow in Q2, with cash conversion of 124% of net income, so really strong cash performance in the quarter. We also repurchased some $225 million of our stock-backs and 3.7 million shares in the quarter. 
Turning to the financial summary. We continue to see weakness in a number of our end markets versus 2015. But sequentially, revenues were up some, as I mentioned, 6% from Q1. Organic revenue declined and FX headwinds are decelerating. Organic revenue is down some 6% from Q1. But -- in Q1, but only 4% in Q2. And as I mentioned, FX also mitigating a little bit, down 1% in Q2 versus 2% in Q1. 
Margin, excluding restructuring costs, were some 16%. That's up 90 basis points from Q1 and an improvement over Q2 of '15 by some 10 basis points. And this is despite some 4% weaker organic revenue. So a real indication that we're getting and we're holding on to the restructuring benefits that we're engaging in across the company.
Turning our attention to Electrical Products segment, a really strong quarter of execution in this business. We're pleased with the Q2 results and we think strong overall performance that we continue to see in this business. Modest year-on-year organic growth, up some 1%, offset by FX, but an acceleration sequentially with revenues, up some 10% from Q1. We continue to see strong execution in the business as evidenced by the significant margin improvement. Excluding restructuring, our operating margins were up some 270 basis points and 150 basis points better than Q1. 
Bookings were down 2% in the quarter on weakness in the Americas' industrial markets and really broad-based weakness in the Asia Pacific region. We did continue to see strength in U.S. residential housing, in the lighting markets, and in Europe, generally. 
Looking at Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were up some 6% from Q1, but 5% worse than Q2 2015. Margins were weaker in Q2 2015 on less favorable mix of projects and also on the impact of a litigation charge that we actually took in this particular business that reduced margins by some 70 basis points. So note, margins, excluding restructuring costs, were, in fact, flat with Q1. 
While somewhat offset by lower commodity prices, the pricing environment in this business does continue to be somewhat difficult. And as we've characterized kind of the net between the 2, we'd say slightly negative on a net commodity cost basis, but certainly, manageable and well within our guidance. 
Bookings are down some 2%, and we're seeing continued weakness here in large industrial projects, weakness in Canada, in oil and gas markets, partially offset by strength in three phase UPS, principally in data centers. Light commercial orders continue to be strong as well as the service business. 
In looking at Hydraulics. Hydraulics markets, I'd say, they appear to be stabilizing and -- but more importantly, I think our team is executing well here. Organic revenues are up some 7% from Q1, but down 7% from last year. 10% margins in the quarter, but I think importantly, 13% when you exclude restructuring costs. And we think the real proof point that the restructuring work that's being undertaken in the business delivering the margin improvement is really coming through. So ex-restructuring costs, profits were essentially flat on 7% lower organic revenue growth, and so we think a really strong performance. 
Bookings declined some 2% in the quarter, and this is really the best quarter that we've seen in bookings in the last 2 years, on particular, strength in EMEA and positive bookings in Asia, with some modest weakness continuing in the Americas. 
In the quarter, OEM orders were down 4%. Distribution orders were down 1%. And really, the area of greatest weakness in the business continues to be on the stationary side of the business, where we had orders that were down, in some cases, up to 33%. We did see strength in the quarter in ag, up 23%. Not sure how much of a retro that is on the total year as we continue to see some concerns there. And construction orders in the quarter were up some 8%. 
In Aerospace, we think a strong operating result in the quarter. Organic revenues were flat with Q2 '15, principally on lower military OEM sales, offset by strength in both large commercial transport and in aftermarket. Margins were once again very strong at 18.6%, up some 160 basis points over Q2 '15. Bookings were down 1% in the quarter. And this is on particular weakness in the bizjet segment, which is a little bit of some surprised weakness for us. But when you adjust for a weakness in bizjet, bookings were up mid-single digits, and aftermarket orders continue to be strong, up some 7%. We also continue to see strength in commercial transport segment, where we saw orders up some 10% in the quarter. 
In looking at Vehicle. Organic revenues were down 14% versus Q2 '15, driven primarily by the 29% decline in Class 8 market and continued double-digit market declines that we're seeing in the Brazilian market. Outside of Brazil, passenger car markets continue to hold up at very high levels, and we expect markets in North America to be flat, with modest growth in EMEA and in Asia. 
Margins, when you exclude restructuring costs, were down some 230 basis points versus 2015, but up 70 basis points versus Q1. So we think with or without restructuring costs, we think strong operating performance in this business and where you're really dealing with some pretty significant headwinds in terms of the Class 8 market and in what's happening in Brazil in general.
If we turn to the organic growth outlook for the year, maybe I'll spend a few extra minutes on this slide, just to give you some color on the way we see the year unfolding. In general, we think markets on balance are performing as we expected. But we do expect the market to remain sluggish throughout the balance of the year. 
And looking at Electrical Products. We'd say here a really mixed story in terms of what's going on in our end markets. We see growth in residential in Lighting in the U.S. Growth in Europe. But we continue to see declines in industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and in Asia. More specifically, we're seeing growth in U.S. residential markets, we think growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're seeing growth in the U.S. lighting market, which we'd say is mid-single digit. And we see growth in Europe, and we think Europe, EMEA will grow some 2% to 3%. And this is offset by weakness in U.S. industrial markets, which we think will be down mid-single digit; weakness in Canada, which we think is down low single digit; and continued weakness in the Asia Pacific region, which we think is also down low single-digit range. 
In Electrical Systems & Services. We continue to see declines in large industrial projects, in oil and gas, but some growth in three phase and power quality in the U.S. market and in Europe, with modest growth in power systems. More specifically, we see the U.S.' and the EMEA's three phase power quality up low single digit. We see some real weakness in harsh and hazardous, we think down some 15% for the year. We think industrial projects continue to be down. And light commercial continues to be a source of strength in the business. And once again, Asia Pac, we think will be down low to mid-single digits for the year. 
Turning our attention to Hydraulics, and certainly, we had a relatively speaking stronger quarter in Hydraulics. And we think, in many ways, this is really a function of easier comps as we move forward during the course of 2016. We continue to see weakness in mobile, particularly in ag equipment. We see certainly continued weakness in oil and gas equipment market and double-digit declines in China construction. And so our call on the hydraulics markets really has not changed materially from the way we originally saw the year. 
In Aerospace. We're seeing low single-digit growth in commercial OE and in commercial aftermarket, offset by, as I'd mentioned earlier, some pretty significant declines in the bizjet segment, which really took orders down in Q2. Some small declines in U.S. defense OEM and some modest growth in defense aftermarket. 
In Vehicle. As we noted, NAFTA Class 8, we think 230,000 units this year, down some 29%. And we continue to see weakness in the Brazilian truck and bus market, we think down 20% for the year, offset by low single-digit growth in NAFTA Class 6 production and some modest growth, as I mentioned, in the light vehicle markets around the world.
If we turn our attention to restructuring, really good news here. Restructuring programs remain on track. Q2 spending came in right at plan at $35 million. And our projects are clearly on track, and we have great line of sight to delivering the benefits that we laid out. 
We did increase our second half spending by $5 million, primarily in Electrical Systems & Services to deal with some of the continued weakness that we're seeing in some of our markets, principally oil and gas and industrial markets. We expect to spend $27 million in Q3 and another $20 million in Q4, increasing our total spending for the year to $145 million. But we've also increased our annual benefits by $5 million, and so really no net change in benefits for the year. So in total, we now expect the program to cost $404 million in total, with benefits of $223 million, both up $5 million from prior forecasts.
Turning our attention to the segment margin expectations, not much in the way of change here. Overall, on a consolidated basis, unchanged from prior guidance. However, we did make a minor adjustment in guidance for both Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. ES&S down some 30 basis points on continued weakness, principally in the higher-margin oil and gas and industrial projects, and Aerospace up some 30 basis points on the basis of ongoing strength in aftermarket and really tight control and development costs inside of the business. Each of the other businesses are expected to be within the ranges noted. And you'll recall that these guidance numbers do, in fact, include restructuring expenses. 
Turning our attention to EPS guidance. Guidance of Q3 reflects continuation of the current overall softness in a number of our end markets. We think organic revenues in Q3 and Q4 are essentially flat with Q2. Flat revenue, but the variances to last year will improve as a result of, as I mentioned earlier, easier comps. Margin expectations will be between 15.5% to 16.5%, reflecting lower restructuring expenses and increased benefits from Q2 and Q3. We think the tax rate will be 8% to 10% in Q3 versus 11% in Q2. And the midpoint of our guidance remains unchanged at $4.30, so we did, in fact, narrow the range by $0.05 on both the high side and the low side.
Turning our attention to the outlook for 2016, the summary table that we normally provide in these calls. I'd say, here, the key changes are once again we updated Q3 guidance, $1.10 to $1.20; a slight increase in foreign exchange, negative benefits by $25 million; and as I mentioned before, simply narrowing the range, but holding the guidance at $4.30. 
So in summary, we think really a strong quarter in Q2. The teams are executing extraordinarily well. Revenues came in more or less as expected, with strong performance in Electrical Products and Aerospace, offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in Electrical Systems & Services. And Hydraulics really showing strong margin improvement, excluding restructuring charges in the quarter. And once again, really importantly, record cash flow as the businesses are really doing a nice job of converting net income to cash. 
We remain committed to our $700 million of share repurchase. We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter, $225 million. The markets are unfolding as we expected, and the full year outlook is unchanged, down 2% to 4%. And the restructuring programs are basically delivering, $174 million of incremental profit in 2016 over '15, and it's setting up well for us to deliver another $120 million of incremental profits in 2017 over 2016. 
So I'll stop here and turn it back to Don, and we'll go to question and answer."

We had this legal settlement related to a 3-year old or so commercial negotiation that ended up impacting the Electrical Systems & Services segment. And so that did take our margins down by 70 basis points in the quarter, and just a commercial settlement from a prior matter. And in terms of the company's exposure to oil and gas, most of our exposure that's inside of the Electrical business is in the Electrical Systems & Services business. You'll recall that when we acquired Cooper, we also acquired a very large business called Crouse-Hinds that has a very big exposure to what we call harsh and hazardous markets, including oil and gas. And so we're certainly seeing an impact in that business as well as in all of our businesses that are exposed to oil and gas. I'd say, in terms of the overall oil and gas market, I think, at this juncture, we'd say we've certainly have not seen any improvement in oil and gas. And maybe we've seen a little bit of deceleration in oil and gas, not material changes from our original assumptions for the year, but clearly, we've not seen any indications that, that market has turned. And to your point around the second derivative and the other kind of markets that are tied to oil and gas, I think we really have been experiencing all year that second derivative impact. And so yes, it's oil and gas, but in many cases, oil and gas companies, whether it's upstream or downstream, they all live under one roof. And so we've seen kind of the other knock-on effects from oil and gas-related industries and -- already impact our business and is already reflected in our guidance."

There's a little bit of uncertainty around what the future looks like around commodity prices as you read all the same press clippings that I do. And we have seen a little bit of an uptick in some commodities in the last 30 days. We've seen others tick down. So we think, largely speaking, that commodity prices for the full year will be very much in line with what our expectations were. We're not getting leverage right now in the business because we're not, for the most part, growing volume.

And so it really does run the gamut. Certainly, if you take a look at vehicle markets, and that's probably the big standout this year. Light vehicle production and sales has been up mid-single digit all year, so we're seeing real strength there. Hydraulics markets in Europe, while still negative, less negative than we anticipated. In fact, that's a market we think down low single-digit this year, which is a better outlook than we anticipated. On the Electrical side of the house, once again, we're seeing growth, for the most part, in many of our end markets in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems & Services. And we think those markets grow slightly this year. We think up, once again, low single digit. So it's really, we'd say, been a broad-based kind of beat versus our internal expectations. Modest, but pretty broad. And at this point, it's too early to say, and then your follow-up question may be in terms of what happens with Brexit and the Turkey matter, at this point, it's too early to say. On the positive side, we are, today, a net exporter out of the U.K. So we don't think that is going to have a big issue. And the same thing would be true of Turkey.

And a lot of that driven by some of the duties that were -- that have been put on imports coming out of China. And that's had a knock-on effect of steel prices around the world. In the near term, we think we're fine. In terms of the net impact to the company, we do have -- we did some pre-buying. We do have some hedges in place. And so we think in the near term, we have the ability to mitigate the impact of steel price increases. We'll have to wait and see how long these increases stay in effect, whether this is a short-term blip or it's a long-term blip. And in the event that's a longer-term impact, we'd have to actually revisit our pricing assumption and we'd find a way to pass it on into the marketplace.

To your point around auto weakness, we certainly have seen a lot of the reports, reading the same ones that you have. We continue to take a very cautious view on the outlook for automotive markets. We think North America will be largely flat this year, and Europe and Asia will be up slightly. But like you, we're taking a very cautious turn -- view of it. And we're being -- getting prepared, that any event that we do have a downturn, we're going to be well prepared to deal with it. I will add that there's a number of economic forecasters who do have a view that's already out for 2017. And we're not sure if they're right or wrong, but whether it's IHS or some of the other economic forecasters, they think that the market essentially continues at these high levels on into 2017 that are essentially with flat or maybe up 1% or so, 1% or 2%. But we're watching it, just like you, and we'll be prepared in the event that it takes a turn for the worst."

The second priority we said is, in fact, to ensure that we continue to maintain a very strong dividend. The third priority we said was to buy back shares, especially in this environment. We think that our stock price is on sale, and we think we can create a lot of value by buying back our shares. And then the fourth priority would be to do M&A.

Hey, I'm sure you've all had an opportunity to work through the material, and so I'll hit a few of the highlights and add a bit of color to the results. Operating earnings per share, we're really pleased with the results in the quarter at $1.07, $0.02 up, ahead of our guidance. And as we anticipated, sales in the quarter came in at $5.1 billion, down 5% organically -- down 5%, organic revenue down some 4%. And this is really consistent with the normal patterns that we see, Q2 sales at 5% above Q1, and quite frankly, FX was a little better, 1% better than it was in Q1 as well. 
Segment operating profits came in at 15.4% versus our guidance of between 15% and 16% and I'd say, with particularly strong margins in Electrical Products as well as in Aerospace, both of which came in at 18.6% when you exclude some of the restructuring charges, and offsetting a bit of weakness in Electrical Systems & Services. 
Restructuring costs in the quarter came in right as expected at $35 million and reducing our margin by some 60 basis points. Adjusting for restructuring costs and FX, really strong decremental performance by the company overall in each of our businesses. And we're really pleased with the fact that we had record cash flow in Q2, with cash conversion of 124% of net income, so really strong cash performance in the quarter. We also repurchased some $225 million of our stock back, some 3.7 million shares in the quarter. 
Turning to the financial summary. We continue to see weakness in a number of our end markets versus 2015. But sequentially, revenues were up some, as I mentioned, 6% from Q1. Organic revenue declined and FX headwinds are decelerating. Organic revenue is down some 6% from Q1. But -- in Q1, but only 4% in Q2. And as I mentioned, FX also mitigating a little bit, down 1% in Q2 versus 2% in Q1. 
Margins, excluding restructuring costs, were some 16%. That's up 90 basis points from Q1 and an improvement over Q2 of '15 by some 10 basis points. And this is despite some 4% weaker organic revenue. So a real indication that we're getting and we're holding on to the restructuring benefits that we're engaging in across the company.
Turning our attention to Electrical Products segment, a really strong quarter of execution in this business. We're pleased with the Q2 results and we think strong overall performance that we continue to see in this business. Modest year-on-year organic growth, up some 1%, offset by FX, but an acceleration sequentially with revenues up some 10% from Q1. We continue to see strong execution in the business as evidenced by the significant margin improvement. Excluding restructuring, our operating margins were up some 270 basis points and 150 basis points better than Q1. 
Bookings were down 2% in the quarter on weakness in the Americas' industrial markets and really broad-based weakness in the Asia Pacific region. We did continue to see strength in U.S. residential housing, in the lighting markets, and in Europe, generally. 
Looking at Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were up some 6% from Q1, but 5% worse than Q2 2015. Margins were weaker in Q2 2015 on less favorable mix of projects and also on the impact of a litigation charge that we actually took in this particular business that reduced margins by some 70 basis points. So note, margins, excluding restructuring costs, were, in fact, flat with Q1. 
While somewhat offset by lower commodity prices, the pricing environment in this business does continue to be somewhat difficult. And as we've characterized kind of the net between the 2, we'd say slightly negative on a net commodity cost basis, but certainly, manageable and well within our guidance. 
Bookings are down some 2%, and we're seeing continued weakness here in large industrial projects, weakness in Canada, in oil and gas markets, partially offset by strength in three-phase UPS, principally in data centers. Light commercial orders continue to be strong as well as the service business. 
In looking at Hydraulics. Hydraulics markets, I'd say, they appear to be stabilizing and -- but more importantly, I think our team is executing well here. Organic revenues are up some 7% from Q1, but down 7% from last year. 10% margins in the quarter, but I think importantly, 13% when you exclude restructuring costs. And we think real proof point that the restructuring work that's being undertaken in the business delivering the margin improvement is really coming through. So ex-restructuring costs, profits were essentially flat on 7% lower organic revenue growth, and so we think a really strong performance. 
Bookings declined some 2% in the quarter, and this is really the best quarter that we've seen in bookings in the last 2 years, on particular strength in EMEA and positive bookings in Asia, with some modest weakness continuing in the Americas. 
In the quarter, OEM orders were down 4%. Distribution orders were down 1%. And really, the area of greatest weakness in the business continues to be on the stationary side of the business, where we had orders were down, in some cases, up to 33%. We did see strength in the quarter in ag, up 23%. Not sure how much of a read-through that is on the total year as we continue to see some concerns there. And construction orders in the quarter were up some 8%. 
In Aerospace, we think a strong operating result in the quarter. Organic revenues were flat with Q2 '15, principally on lower military OEM sales, offset by strength in both large commercial transport and in aftermarket. Margins were once again very strong at 18.6%, up some 160 basis points over Q2 '15. Bookings were down 1% in the quarter. And this is on particular weakness in the bizjet segment, which is a little bit of some surprise weakness for us. But when you adjust for a weakness in bizjet, bookings were up mid-single digits, and aftermarket orders continued to be strong, up some 7%. We also continued to see strength in commercial transport segment, where we saw orders up some 10% in the quarter. 
And looking at Vehicle. Organic revenues were down 14% versus Q2 '15, driven primarily by the 29% decline in Class 8 market and continued double-digit market declines that we're seeing in the Brazilian market. Outside of Brazil, passenger car markets continue to hold up at very high levels, and we expect markets in North America to be flat, with modest growth in EMEA and in Asia. 
Margins, when you exclude restructuring costs, were down some 230 basis points versus 2015, but up 70 basis points versus Q1. So we think with or without restructuring costs, we think strong operating performance in this business and where you're really dealing with some pretty significant headwinds in terms of the Class 8 market and in what's happening in Brazil in general.
If we turn to the organic growth outlook for the year, maybe I'll spend a few extra minutes on this slide, just to give you some color on the way we see the year unfolding. In general, we think markets on balance are performing as we expected. But we do expect the market to remain sluggish throughout the balance of the year. 
And looking at Electrical Products. We'd say here a really mixed story in terms of what's going on in our end markets. We see growth in residential and Lighting in the U.S. Growth in Europe. But we continue to see declines in industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and in Asia. More specifically, we're seeing growth in U.S. residential markets, we think growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're seeing growth in the U.S. lighting market, which we'd say is mid-single digit. And we see growth in Europe, and we think Europe, EMEA grow some 2% to 3%. And this is offset by weakness in U.S. industrial markets, which we think will be down mid-single digit; weakness in Canada, which we think is down low single digit; and continued weakness in the Asia Pacific region, which we think is also down low single-digit range. 
In Electrical Systems & Services. We continue to see declines in large industrial projects, in oil and gas, but some growth in three phase and power quality in the U.S. market and in Europe, with modest growth in power systems. More specifically, we see the U.S.' and the EMEA's three phase power quality up low single digit. We see some real weakness in harsh and hazardous, we think down some 15% for the year. We think industrial projects continue to be down. And light commercial continues to be a source of strength in the business. And once again, Asia Pac, we think will be down low to mid-single digits for the year. 
Turning our attention to Hydraulics, and certainly, we had a relatively speaking stronger quarter in Hydraulics. And we think, in many ways, this is really a function of easier comps as we move forward during the course of 2016. We continue to see weakness in mobile, particularly in ag equipment. We see certainly continued weakness in oil and gas equipment market, double-digit declines in China construction. And so our call on the hydraulics markets really has not changed materially from the way we originally saw the year. 
In Aerospace. We're seeing low single-digit growth in commercial OE and in commercial aftermarket, offset by, as I'd mentioned earlier, some pretty significant declines in the bizjet segment, which really took orders down in Q2. Some small declines in U.S. defense OEM and some modest growth in defense aftermarket. 
In Vehicle. As we noted, NAFTA Class 8, we think 230,000 units this year, down some 29%. And we continue to see weakness in the Brazilian truck and bus market, we think down 20% for the year, offset by low single-digit growth in NAFTA Class 6 production and some modest growth, as I mentioned, in the light vehicle markets around the world.
If we turn our attention to restructuring, really good news here. Restructuring programs remain on track. Q2 spending came in right at plan at $35 million. And our projects are clearly on track, and we have great line of sight to delivering the benefits that we laid out. 
We did increase our second half spending by $5 million, primarily in Electrical Systems & Services to deal with some of the continued weakness that we're seeing in some of our markets, principally oil and gas and industrial markets. We expect to spend $27 million in Q3 and another $20 million in Q4, increasing our total spending for the year to $145 million. But we've also increased our annual benefits by $5 million, and so really no net change in benefits for the year. So in total, we now expect the program to cost $404 million in total, with benefits of $223 million, both up $5 million from prior forecasts.
Turning our attention to the segment margin expectations, not much in the way of change here. Overall, on a consolidated basis, unchanged from prior guidance. However, we did make a minor adjustment in guidance for both Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. ES&S down some 30 basis points on continued weakness, principally in the higher-margin oil and gas and industrial projects, and Aerospace up some 30 basis points on the basis of ongoing strength in aftermarket and really tight control and development costs inside of the business. Each of the other businesses are expected to be within the ranges noted. And you'll recall that these guidance numbers do, in fact, include restructuring expenses. 
Turning our attention to EPS guidance. Guidance for Q3 reflects continuation of the current overall softness in a number of our end markets. We think organic revenues in Q3 and Q4 are essentially flat with Q2. Flat revenue, but the variances to last year will improve as a result of, as I mentioned earlier, easier comps. Margin expectations will be between 15.5% to 16.5%, reflecting lower restructuring expenses and increased benefits from Q2 and Q3. We think the tax rate will be 8% to 10% in Q3 versus 11% in Q2. And the midpoint of our guidance remains unchanged at $4.30, so we did, in fact, narrow the range by $0.05 on both the high side and the low side.
Turning our attention to the outlook for 2016, the summary table that we normally provide in these calls. I'd say, here, the key changes are once again we updated Q3 guidance, $1.10 to $1.20; a slight increase in foreign exchange, negative benefit by $25 million; and as I mentioned before, simply narrowing the range, but holding the guidance at $4.30. 
So in summary, we think really a strong quarter in Q2. The teams are executing extraordinarily well. Revenues came in more or less as expected, with strong performance in Electrical Products and Aerospace, offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in Electrical Systems & Services. And Hydraulics really showing strong margin improvement, excluding restructuring charges in the quarter. And once again, really importantly, record cash flow as the businesses are really doing a nice job of converting net income to cash. 
We remain committed to our $700 million of share repurchase. We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter, $225 million. The markets are unfolding as we expected, and the full year outlook is unchanged, at down 2% to 4%. And the restructuring programs are basically delivering, $174 million of incremental profit in 2016 over '15, and it's setting up well for us to deliver another $120 million of incremental profits in 2017 over 2016. 
So I'll stop here and turn it back to Don, and we'll go to question and answer."

We had this legal settlement related to a 3-year-old or so commercial negotiation that ended up impacting the Electrical Systems & Services segment. And so that did take our margins down by 70 basis points in the quarter, and just a commercial settlement from a prior matter. And in terms of the company's exposure to oil and gas, most of our exposure that's inside of the Electrical business is in the Electrical Systems & Services business. You'll recall that when we acquired Cooper, we also acquired a very large business called Crouse-Hinds that has a very big exposure to what we call harsh and hazardous markets, including oil and gas. And so we're certainly seeing an impact in that business as well as in all of our businesses that are exposed to oil and gas. I'd say, in terms of the overall oil and gas market, I think, at this juncture, we'd say we've certainly have not seen any improvement in oil and gas. And maybe we've seen a little bit of deceleration in oil and gas, not material changes from our original assumptions for the year, but clearly, we've not seen any indications that, that market has turned. And to your point around the second derivative and the other kind of markets that are tied to oil and gas, I think we really have been experiencing all year that second derivative impact. And so yes, it's oil and gas, but it's -- in many cases, oil and gas companies, whether it's upstream or downstream, they all live under one roof. And so we've seen kind of the other knock-on effects from oil and gas-related industries and -- already impact our business and is already reflected in our guidance."

But if we think about the entire year, we think we're largely on plan and on expectations. There's a little bit of uncertainty around what the future looks like around commodity prices as you read all the same press clippings that I do. And we have seen a little bit of an uptick in some commodities in the last 30 days. We've seen others tick down. So we think, largely speaking, that commodity prices for the full year will be very much in line with what our expectations were. We're not getting leverage right now in the business because we're not, for the most part, growing volume. And so it really is a function of our businesses doing a good job of flexing our cost in anticipation of this weak market environment that we're living in."

Light vehicle production and sales has been up mid-single digit all year, so we're seeing real strength there. Hydraulics markets in Europe, while still negative, less negative than we anticipated. In fact, that's markets we think down low single-digit this year, which is a better outlook than we anticipated. On the Electrical side of the house, once again, we're seeing growth, for the most part, in many of our end markets in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems & Services.

We had a strong quarter of order input in ag and construction. We don't think that's in any way indicative of the underlying market performance. And so it's probably a function of a bit weaker comps than we had last year and to your point, perhaps, some pre-buying that's taking place in anticipation of summer shutdowns. And so that's why our call in the year for Hydraulics hasn't changed. And we still think that the guidance that we provided on the full year is very much consistent with what we're feeling and experiencing in the business. The pricing environment in Hydraulics is just fine. We're not seeing any particular or unusual pressures there with respect to -- that, once again, we always talk about it in terms of the net of commodity input costs and price. And so we think it will be net about neutral, if price is not going to be a tailwind or -- for us this year or a headwind."

And a lot of that driven by some of the duties that were -- that have been put on imports coming out of China. And that's had a knock-on effect of steel prices around the world. In the near term, we think we're fine. In terms of the net impact to the company, we do have -- we did some pre-buying. We do have some hedges in place. And so we think in the near term, we have the ability to mitigate the impact of steel price increases. We'll have to wait and see how long these increases stay in effect, whether this is a short-term blip or it's a long-term blip. And in the event that's a longer-term impact, we'd have to actually revisit our pricing assumption and we'd find a way to pass it on into the marketplace. And so we think, once again, on balance, we'll do what we've always done in inflationary environments. We'll find a way to pass it on to the customer base. And I think it's been well publicized, it's well understood, and so we don't think that poses a risk to our margins. To your point around auto weakness, we certainly have seen a lot of the reports, reading the same ones that you have. We continue to take a very cautious view on the outlook for automotive markets. We think North America will be largely flat this year, and Europe and Asia will be up slightly. But like you, we're taking a very cautious turn -- view of it. And we're being -- getting prepared, that in the event that we do have a downturn, we're going to be well prepared to deal with it. I will add that there's a number of economic forecasters who do have a view that's already out for 2017. And we're not sure if they're right or wrong, but whether it's IHS or some of the other economic forecasters, they think that the market essentially continues at these high levels on into 2017 that are essentially with flat or maybe up 1% or so, 1% or 2%.

Hey, I'm sure you've all had an opportunity to work through the material, and so I'll hit a few of the highlights and add a bit of color to the results. Operating earnings per share, we're really pleased with the results in the quarter at $1.07, $0.02 up, ahead of our guidance. And as we anticipated, sales in the quarter came in at $5.1 billion, down 5% organically -- down 5%, organic revenue down some 4%. And this is really consistent with the normal patterns that we see, Q2 sales at 5% above Q1, and quite frankly, FX was a little better, 1% better than it was in Q1 as well. 
Segment operating profits came in at 15.4% versus our guidance of between 15% and 16% and I'd say, with particularly strong margins in Electrical Products as well as in Aerospace, both of which came in at 18.6% when you exclude some of the restructuring charges, and offsetting a bit of weakness in Electrical Systems & Services. 
Restructuring costs in the quarter came in right as expected at $35 million and reducing our margin by some 60 basis points. Adjusting for restructuring costs and FX, really strong decremental performance by the company overall in each of our businesses. And we're really pleased with the fact that we had record cash flow in Q2, with cash conversion of 124% of net income, so really strong cash performance in the quarter. We also repurchased some $225 million of our stock back, some 3.7 million shares in the quarter. 
Turning to the financial summary. We continue to see weakness in a number of our end markets versus 2015. But sequentially, revenues were up some, as I mentioned, 6% from Q1. Organic revenue declined and FX headwinds are decelerating. Organic revenue is down some 6% from Q1. But -- in Q1, but only 4% in Q2. And as I mentioned, FX also mitigating a little bit, down 1% in Q2 versus 2% in Q1. 
Margins, excluding restructuring costs, were some 16%. That's up 90 basis points from Q1 and an improvement over Q2 of '15 by some 10 basis points. And this is despite some 4% weaker organic revenue. So a real indication that we're getting and we're holding on to the restructuring benefits that we're engaging in across the company.
Turning our attention to Electrical Products segment, a really strong quarter of execution in this business. We're pleased with the Q2 results and we think strong overall performance that we continue to see in this business. Modest year-on-year organic growth, up some 1%, offset by FX, but an acceleration sequentially with revenues up some 10% from Q1. We continue to see strong execution in the business as evidenced by the significant margin improvement. Excluding restructuring, our operating margins were up some 270 basis points and 150 basis points better than Q1. 
Bookings were down 2% in the quarter on weakness in the Americas' industrial markets and really broad-based weakness in the Asia Pacific region. We did continue to see strength in U.S. residential housing, in the lighting markets, and in Europe, generally. 
Looking at Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were up some 6% from Q1, but 5% worse than Q2 2015. Margins were weaker in Q2 2015 on less favorable mix of projects and also on the impact of a litigation charge that we actually took in this particular business that reduced margins by some 70 basis points. So note, margins, excluding restructuring costs, were, in fact, flat with Q1. 
While somewhat offset by lower commodity prices, the pricing environment in this business does continue to be somewhat difficult. And as we've characterized kind of the net between the 2, we'd say slightly negative on a net commodity cost basis, but certainly, manageable and well within our guidance. 
Bookings are down some 2%, and we're seeing continued weakness here in large industrial projects, weakness in Canada, in oil and gas markets, partially offset by strength in three-phase UPS, principally in data centers. Light commercial orders continue to be strong as well as the service business. 
In looking at Hydraulics. Hydraulics markets, I'd say, they appear to be stabilizing and -- but more importantly, I think our team is executing well here. Organic revenues are up some 7% from Q1, but down 7% from last year. 10% margins in the quarter, but I think importantly, 13% when you exclude restructuring costs. And we think real proof point that the restructuring work that's being undertaken in the business delivering the margin improvement is really coming through. So ex-restructuring costs, profits were essentially flat on 7% lower organic revenue growth, and so we think a really strong performance. 
Bookings declined some 2% in the quarter, and this is really the best quarter that we've seen in bookings in the last 2 years, on particular strength in EMEA and positive bookings in Asia, with some modest weakness continuing in the Americas. 
In the quarter, OEM orders were down 4%. Distribution orders were down 1%. And really, the area of greatest weakness in the business continues to be on the stationary side of the business, where we had orders were down, in some cases, up to 33%. We did see strength in the quarter in ag, up 23%. Not sure how much of a read-through that is on the total year as we continue to see some concerns there. And construction orders in the quarter were up some 8%. 
In Aerospace, we think a strong operating result in the quarter. Organic revenues were flat with Q2 '15, principally on lower military OEM sales, offset by strength in both large commercial transport and in aftermarket. Margins were once again very strong at 18.6%, up some 160 basis points over Q2 '15. Bookings were down 1% in the quarter. And this is on particular weakness in the bizjet segment, which is a little bit of some surprise weakness for us. But when you adjust for a weakness in bizjet, bookings were up mid-single digits, and aftermarket orders continued to be strong, up some 7%. We also continued to see strength in commercial transport segment, where we saw orders up some 10% in the quarter. 
And looking at Vehicle. Organic revenues were down 14% versus Q2 '15, driven primarily by the 29% decline in Class 8 market and continued double-digit market declines that we're seeing in the Brazilian market. Outside of Brazil, passenger car markets continue to hold up at very high levels, and we expect markets in North America to be flat, with modest growth in EMEA and in Asia. 
Margins, when you exclude restructuring costs, were down some 230 basis points versus 2015, but up 70 basis points versus Q1. So we think with or without restructuring costs, we think strong operating performance in this business and where you're really dealing with some pretty significant headwinds in terms of the Class 8 market and in what's happening in Brazil in general.
If we turn to the organic growth outlook for the year, maybe I'll spend a few extra minutes on this slide, just to give you some color on the way we see the year unfolding. In general, we think markets on balance are performing as we expected. But we do expect the market to remain sluggish throughout the balance of the year. 
And looking at Electrical Products. We'd say here a really mixed story in terms of what's going on in our end markets. We see growth in residential and Lighting in the U.S. Growth in Europe. But we continue to see declines in industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and in Asia. More specifically, we're seeing growth in U.S. residential markets, we think growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're seeing growth in the U.S. lighting market, which we'd say is mid-single digit. And we see growth in Europe, and we think Europe, EMEA grow some 2% to 3%. And this is offset by weakness in U.S. industrial markets, which we think will be down mid-single digit; weakness in Canada, which we think is down low single digit; and continued weakness in the Asia Pacific region, which we think is also down low single-digit range. 
In Electrical Systems & Services. We continue to see declines in large industrial projects, in oil and gas, but some growth in three phase and power quality in the U.S. market and in Europe, with modest growth in power systems. More specifically, we see the U.S.' and the EMEA's three phase power quality up low single digit. We see some real weakness in harsh and hazardous, we think down some 15% for the year. We think industrial projects continue to be down. And light commercial continues to be a source of strength in the business. And once again, Asia Pac, we think will be down low to mid-single digits for the year. 
Turning our attention to Hydraulics, and certainly, we had a relatively speaking stronger quarter in Hydraulics. And we think, in many ways, this is really a function of easier comps as we move forward during the course of 2016. We continue to see weakness in mobile, particularly in ag equipment. We see certainly continued weakness in oil and gas equipment market, double-digit declines in China construction. And so our call on the hydraulics markets really has not changed materially from the way we originally saw the year. 
In Aerospace. We're seeing low single-digit growth in commercial OE and in commercial aftermarket, offset by, as I'd mentioned earlier, some pretty significant declines in the bizjet segment, which really took orders down in Q2. Some small declines in U.S. defense OEM and some modest growth in defense aftermarket. 
In Vehicle. As we noted, NAFTA Class 8, we think 230,000 units this year, down some 29%. And we continue to see weakness in the Brazilian truck and bus market, we think down 20% for the year, offset by low single-digit growth in NAFTA Class 6 production and some modest growth, as I mentioned, in the light vehicle markets around the world.
If we turn our attention to restructuring, really good news here. Restructuring programs remain on track. Q2 spending came in right at plan at $35 million. And our projects are clearly on track, and we have great line of sight to delivering the benefits that we laid out. 
We did increase our second half spending by $5 million, primarily in Electrical Systems & Services to deal with some of the continued weakness that we're seeing in some of our markets, principally oil and gas and industrial markets. We expect to spend $27 million in Q3 and another $20 million in Q4, increasing our total spending for the year to $145 million. But we've also increased our annual benefits by $5 million, and so really no net change in benefits for the year. So in total, we now expect the program to cost $404 million in total, with benefits of $223 million, both up $5 million from prior forecasts.
Turning our attention to the segment margin expectations, not much in the way of change here. Overall, on a consolidated basis, unchanged from prior guidance. However, we did make a minor adjustment in guidance for both Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. ES&S down some 30 basis points on continued weakness, principally in the higher-margin oil and gas and industrial projects, and Aerospace up some 30 basis points on the basis of ongoing strength in aftermarket and really tight control and development costs inside of the business. Each of the other businesses are expected to be within the ranges noted. And you'll recall that these guidance numbers do, in fact, include restructuring expenses. 
Turning our attention to EPS guidance. Guidance for Q3 reflects continuation of the current overall softness in a number of our end markets. We think organic revenues in Q3 and Q4 are essentially flat with Q2. Flat revenue, but the variances to last year will improve as a result of, as I mentioned earlier, easier comps. Margin expectations will be between 15.5% to 16.5%, reflecting lower restructuring expenses and increased benefits from Q2 and Q3. We think the tax rate will be 8% to 10% in Q3 versus 11% in Q2. And the midpoint of our guidance remains unchanged at $4.30, so we did, in fact, narrow the range by $0.05 on both the high side and the low side.
Turning our attention to the outlook for 2016, the summary table that we normally provide in these calls. I'd say, here, the key changes are once again we updated Q3 guidance, $1.10 to $1.20; a slight increase in foreign exchange, negative benefit by $25 million; and as I mentioned before, simply narrowing the range, but holding the guidance at $4.30. 
So in summary, we think really a strong quarter in Q2. The teams are executing extraordinarily well. Revenues came in more or less as expected, with strong performance in Electrical Products and Aerospace, offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in Electrical Systems & Services. And Hydraulics really showing strong margin improvement, excluding restructuring charges in the quarter. And once again, really importantly, record cash flow as the businesses are really doing a nice job of converting net income to cash. 
We remain committed to our $700 million of share repurchase. We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter, $225 million. The markets are unfolding as we expected, and the full year outlook is unchanged, at down 2% to 4%. And the restructuring programs are basically delivering, $174 million of incremental profit in 2016 over '15, and it's setting up well for us to deliver another $120 million of incremental profits in 2017 over 2016. 
So I'll stop here and turn it back to Don, and we'll go to question and answer."

We had this legal settlement related to a 3-year-old or so commercial negotiation that ended up impacting the Electrical Systems & Services segment. And so that did take our margins down by 70 basis points in the quarter, and just a commercial settlement from a prior matter. And in terms of the company's exposure to oil and gas, most of our exposure that's inside of the Electrical business is in the Electrical Systems & Services business. You'll recall that when we acquired Cooper, we also acquired a very large business called Crouse-Hinds that has a very big exposure to what we call harsh and hazardous markets, including oil and gas. And so we're certainly seeing an impact in that business as well as in all of our businesses that are exposed to oil and gas. I'd say, in terms of the overall oil and gas market, I think, at this juncture, we'd say we've certainly have not seen any improvement in oil and gas. And maybe we've seen a little bit of deceleration in oil and gas, not material changes from our original assumptions for the year, but clearly, we've not seen any indications that, that market has turned. And to your point around the second derivative and the other kind of markets that are tied to oil and gas, I think we really have been experiencing all year that second derivative impact. And so yes, it's oil and gas, but it's -- in many cases, oil and gas companies, whether it's upstream or downstream, they all live under one roof. And so we've seen kind of the other knock-on effects from oil and gas-related industries and -- already impact our business and is already reflected in our guidance."

But if we think about the entire year, we think we're largely on plan and on expectations. There's a little bit of uncertainty around what the future looks like around commodity prices as you read all the same press clippings that I do. And we have seen a little bit of an uptick in some commodities in the last 30 days. We've seen others tick down. So we think, largely speaking, that commodity prices for the full year will be very much in line with what our expectations were. We're not getting leverage right now in the business because we're not, for the most part, growing volume.

In fact, that's markets we think down low single-digit this year, which is a better outlook than we anticipated. On the Electrical side of the house, once again, we're seeing growth, for the most part, in many of our end markets in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems & Services. And we think those markets grow slightly this year. We think up, once again, low single digit. So it's really, we'd say, been a broad-based kind of beat versus our internal expectations. Modest, but pretty broad. And at this point, it's too early to say, and then your follow-up question may be in terms of what happens with Brexit and the Turkey matter, at this point, it's too early to say. On the positive side, we are, today, a net exporter out of the U.K. So we don't think that is going to have a big issue. And the same thing would be true of Turkey. So really, it's been a broad-based kind of, we'd say, beat where Europe, in general, has performed slightly better than what we anticipated."

And so it's probably a function of a bit weaker comps than we had last year and to your point, perhaps, some pre-buying that's taking place in anticipation of summer shutdowns. And so that's why our call in the year for Hydraulics hasn't changed. And we still think that the guidance that we provided on the full year is very much consistent with what we're feeling and experiencing in the business. The pricing environment in Hydraulics is just fine. We're not seeing any particular or unusual pressures there with respect to -- that, once again, we always talk about it in terms of the net of commodity input costs and price.

And a lot of that driven by some of the duties that were -- that have been put on imports coming out of China. And that's had a knock-on effect of steel prices around the world. In the near term, we think we're fine. In terms of the net impact to the company, we do have -- we did some pre-buying. We do have some hedges in place. And so we think in the near term, we have the ability to mitigate the impact of steel price increases. We'll have to wait and see how long these increases stay in effect, whether this is a short-term blip or it's a long-term blip. And in the event that's a longer-term impact, we'd have to actually revisit our pricing assumption and we'd find a way to pass it on into the marketplace. And so we think, once again, on balance, we'll do what we've always done in inflationary environments. We'll find a way to pass it on to the customer base. And I think it's been well publicized, it's well understood, and so we don't think that poses a risk to our margins. To your point around auto weakness, we certainly have seen a lot of the reports, reading the same ones that you have. We continue to take a very cautious view on the outlook for automotive markets. We think North America will be largely flat this year, and Europe and Asia will be up slightly. But like you, we're taking a very cautious turn -- view of it. And we're being -- getting prepared, that in the event that we do have a downturn, we're going to be well prepared to deal with it. I will add that there's a number of economic forecasters who do have a view that's already out for 2017. And we're not sure if they're right or wrong, but whether it's IHS or some of the other economic forecasters, they think that the market essentially continues at these high levels on into 2017 that are essentially with flat or maybe up 1% or so, 1% or 2%.

But all of that thinking and the current commodity prices are factored into our guidance for the year, so it's all fully baked into 2016 at the current activity levels, at the current inflated levels of steel prices. And so I don't really have the number in terms of specifically the steel commodity itself and how much in terms of bifurcating that from the rest of what we buy."

I know that most of you have worked through the earnings release and the details of our earnings already as I've seen a number of your reports already. So what I'll try to do this morning is hit the highlights and then maybe add some color commentary in and around the results. 
First of all, you noted that EPS did come in at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15 and we're actually pleased with these results despite revenue coming in weaker than what we expected. We actually delivered strong operating margins at 16% -- 16.5%, excluding restructuring, in largely as a result of better restructuring benefits and good cost control across the company. 
We had another strong cash quarter. Our [ph] cash flows were $798 million in the quarter. Our cash conversion ratios within the quarter were 130%, driven by strong margins and the benefits of amortization. Year-to-date, our cash conversion ratio is 110%. We took advantage of our strong cash position and we've repurchased 3.7 million shares, $243 million in the quarter. And this brings our full year repurchases to 9.2 million shares or $560 million versus our target of $700 million for the year. 
Turning to Page 4, financial summary. As we said, total revenues in the quarter came in weaker than we expected. If you recall from our earlier guidance, we expected Q3 revenues would be flat with Q2, and organic revenues actually came in down 1% with less seasonal growth in both of our electrical segments as well as weaker sales in Aerospace and Vehicle. Revenue is 4% lower than prior year with 3% of that coming from lower organic revenues. 
We did have strong operating performance, as I mentioned in the quarter. A couple points of reference for you. In comparison with Q2, we delivered $20 million more of additional segment operating profits or $93 million of lower revenue. And excluding restructuring costs, the improvement in profit was $7 million on, once again, $93 million of lower revenue. And one more comparison point for you when you compare with Q3 of '15, excluding restructuring costs, we delivered strong decremental performance. Profits were actually down some $27 million on $216 million of lower revenue, a 12% decremental rate. So we continue to think that the businesses are executing extraordinary well in a tough revenue environment.  And as a result, we were able to deliver a small improvement in segment margins, despite the decline in revenue. 
And turning our attention to the segments, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Here our revenues were flat year-on-year, but down 1% versus Q2, largely on currency and continued weakness in our industrial markets. Areas of strength included LED lighting, up mid-double-digits with LEDs sales now accounting for 68% of our total lighting revenue. Residential construction was up mid-single digits year-on-year as well. And the key area of weakness here really is -- continues to be industrial controls and the components that we make in our Electrical Products business that are actually sold through the assembly side of our house. So really, a continuation of the trend that we've seen all year. 
Margins continue to be strong at 18.8%. And if you take a look at bookings, bookings were down 1% in the quarter, a little better than last quarter where we're down 2%, but certainly not up to the expectation that we had with strength in lighting, in residential markets, strength in the Middle East, Western Europe and continued weakness, as I noted, in industrial controls. In Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, 2% organically versus Q3 of '15. And essentially, flat sequentially from Q2. You will recall that in Q2, our bookings were down 2%. So we've clearly seen a bit of deterioration in this segment as bookings were down 5% in Q3 driven by, once again, a continuation of a [ph] that we've seen all year. Continued weakness in industrial projects in oil and gas offset by some strength in U.S. light commercial markets, Asia Pacific, Northern Europe. But clearly, these areas of strength were not large enough to offset the declines in the other markets. 
Margins were 14.2%, excluding restructuring costs and up from both prior year in Q2, really reflecting the benefits of the restructuring work that's going on across the company and in the segment. In the Hydraulics segment, revenues were down 6% from prior year and down 5% from Q2. This Q2 to Q3 change is seasonality and is really consistent with prior year, so not at all unexpected. Q3 revenue shows about equal weakness in both OEM and distribution. And within the OEM channel, stationary was down more than the mobile side of the business, largely as a result of the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. Bookings declined 3% in the quarter, very similar to the levels that we've seen in Q2 which were down 2%. But here, we do see some differences between OEM and distribution, with OEM orders up 2% and distribution orders down 8%. We're once again very pleased with our margins, which came in at 10.9% and 12.6%, excluding restructuring. 
In Aerospace, revenues were flat organically and down 3% excluding FX, and the FX impact was entirely the result of the lower British pound. Revenues were down 2% from Q2 and down 1% organically from Q2. Encouragingly, we once again, saw very strong margins which were 20% in our Aerospace segment and also strong quarterly bookings. Bookings were up some 15% in the quarter with continued strength in both commercial and military OEM, partially offset by continued weakness in business and regional jet activity. Aftermarket bookings were also up 5% in the quarter with particular strength on the commercial side. 
And in the Vehicle segment. Revenues were down 12% year-on-year driven principally by the large decline that we're seeing in the NAFTA heavy-duty truck market. Production was down some 35% in Q3. Revenues were also down 5% versus Q2. And so we now expect the NAFTA heavy-duty truck production to be approximately 225,000 units this year versus our prior thinking of 230,000 units. Passenger Vehicle sales in the quarter remained strong with particular strength in China and modest strength in Europe. And in margins, well, certainly below prior year, [ph] remain at attractive levels at 15.5% and 15.2%, excluding restructuring. And if we take a look at the balance of the year, what we're really seeing here is industrial weakness, and an industrial weakness that is continuing. And so we now have updated our overall revenue forecast to be down 4% for the year. And so we're really thinking that the year now comes in at the lower end of our guidance. 
And as you'll note from the chart on Page 10, we did, in fact, make a number of meaningful adjustments to our full year outlook, and I'll walk you through some of the detail here and some of the drivers. First in Electrical Products. We took our mid- to midpoint of our guidance down 1.5 points, and this is principally due to industrial weakness in industrial components and industrial products such as fuses [ph] and structural support products, and as well as some softness in some particular geographies, notably, in the Middle East and Canada. In Electrical Systems & Services, some tuning here. We took our guidance down 0.5 basis points. And this is principally a result of continued weakness in the oil and gas projects, including the Middle East. And then large industrial project activity slowed even more than what we anticipated in the quarter. 
In Hydraulics, the one segment where we're actually taking our revenue guidance up for the year, up 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of what we're seeing a stabilization in China and what we think is a bit of an inventory correction that's taking place in some of our customers and some of our markets. In Aerospace, we took the guidance down 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of ongoing weakness in business and regional jet and lower military spending. And then lastly, in Vehicles. A couple of point reduction in our guidance for the year. And this is 100% a result of the ongoing weakness that we're seeing in the heavy-duty truck market and the reduction in the market from 230,000 to 225,000 units. And that all cascades through the company's revenue being down some 1% from prior guidance. 
If we turn our attention to Page 11, restructuring. We're pleased to report that restructuring plan is going well. Costs are essentially coming in at plan levels at $145 million. We spent some $23 million in Q3 versus our original expectation of spending $27 million, and this is largely due to some timing. And we think, at this point, Q4 will be $24 million versus our previous guidance of $20 million, so a little bit of a flip between the quarters. We are, in fact, seeing benefits coming in slightly better than what we anticipated at $200 million for the year versus our previous guide of $190 million, and we saw these benefits largely come through in Q3. And a result of that is, clearly, we're updating our segment margin expectations for the year as well. 
And as a result of lower revenue and the decremental on that [ph] a slightly different mix of restructuring in some of the businesses, we're also updating our full year forecast for segment margins. For Eaton, overall, as you can see on this chart, it results in a 40 basis point reduction in operating margin versus our prior guidance. And then if you just look at the different businesses, quickly I'll walk through them, Electrical Products up slightly, basically, on expectation. In Electrical Systems & Services, a 30 basis point reduction, and that's essentially decremental on the change in revenue. In Hydraulics, 2 things going on here actually. One is higher restructuring cost in our Hydraulics business than we originally planned. And then secondly, a little bit of a mix issue in terms of the mix between the OEM channel and the distribution channel that's playing through. And as I think, most of you are aware, margins tend to be higher in the distribution channel than on the OEM channel. 
And in Aerospace, we're taking our margins up for the year, a 90 basis point increase. And 2 things really driving this change: One is timing and programs spending. Program costs as you know, tend to be lumpy over time. And then a little bit lower restructuring costs in Aerospace. And then lastly, in Vehicle. It's principally a function of lower volume and mix as most of the volume reduction is coming in the North America heavy-duty Class 8 market, which tends to be a little bit more profitable than the rest of the business overall. And so once again, that will cascade through to a 40 basis point reduction. 
If we take a look at our guidance and the outlook for Q4. And as you -- as we reported, we now expect revenues to be down 1.5 points from Q3. We expect margins will be between 15.4% and 15.8%, driven largely by, once again, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, growth in lighting and some weakness in industrial controls and large industrial projects and continued weakness in oil and gas. And we're reducing our Q4 guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint with a range of $1.05 to $1.15. We expect our tax rates will be between 9% and 10% in Q4. And as we said earlier, for the full year, the updated revenue forecast is that organic growth will now be down 4%. And this $0.10 reduction in Q4 EPS amounts to about a 2% reduction in our EPS for the year and drive the change in the midpoint of our guidance as reported. 
So in summary, the chart that we always provide is a summary of kind of the key assumptions for the year laid out on the chart on Page 14. You can see the assumption on the revenue change. Corporate costs are now forecasted to come in at $90 million below 2015 levels versus the previous guidance of $80 million, so a little bit better cost control and a little bit better benefits and restructuring. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 9% and 10% versus the previous guidance of between 9% and 11%. And you can see the EPS forecast we talked about and cash flow guidance, unchanged. So while we're seeing a little bit lower profit, this is offset by better working capital management. 
So just stepping back from the year and a summary of Q3. We see this period of general weakness in industrial markets continuing. Despite this weakness, we think that our team delivered solid results in Q3. This order weakness, however, that we saw in Q3 is reflected in our Q4 forecast, where we see EPS will be $0.05 below Q3 and $0.10 below our full year guidance. These changes are obviously cascading through, but we do expect to maintain our guidance on cash flow and share repurchase for the year. So if you kind of -- our initial thoughts and a look at 2017, I'd say, while it's difficult to make a call on 2017, we do think this period of market uncertainty and caution on capital spending will extend into 2017. We're clearly dealing with a bit of a 2-speed economy where the consumer side of the markets continue to do well, but industrial markets continue to be weaken and certain at best. 
So in response, as you noted in our earnings release, we're expanding our restructuring program by $50 million in 2017 to $180 million in total. Other areas where we're likely to face a bit of a headwind for 2017, our pension plan discount rate will likely be lower by 25 to 40 basis points. The 2016 discount rate was 4.25%. And the way to think about this is for every 25 basis point decline in the discount rate, it results in a $20 million increase in annual pension expense. We're likely to see slightly higher interest expense in 2017. LIBOR has risen. And as a result, of the change in the money market -- as a result, changes in money market regulations, and this increase is the cost of our floating rate debt. We also potentially have some transitional interest expense related to refinancing some debt in 2017. And then we do expect a slightly higher tax rate as well next year. We certainly remain on track to generate very strong cash flow and we expect cash conversion in 2017 to continue to be above 100%. And this will certainly allow us to stay on track with a share repurchase program that we've announced and to deliver the targets that we've laid out. 
So this concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn it back to Don at this point."

I think it really is a question around 2017 with respect to where some of these end markets are headed. And quite frankly, we were surprised and disappointed with our bookings and the way a lot of the end markets kind of played out in Q3. The question, is that a temporary pause?

In terms of this, certainly this is the business that is most closely tied to infrastructure spending, large projects. And so it is very difficult in the near term to fundamentally delink this business or really any of our businesses from the secular trends that are taking place in these large end markets. Having said that, we have lots of growth initiative that we're focused on in every one of our businesses in the Electrical Systems & Services included.

I'd say that one of the principal issues is if you look at the size of the company today versus what we had forecasted, let's say, going back in the last strategic planning period, Eaton is a smaller company. A lot of our end markets over this period in time did not perform anywhere close to what our expectations were. So there's a piece of what we're doing that's essentially rightsizing our company given the current revenue in the certain size of commercial and economic activity across our enterprise. And having said that and as you are well aware as well, yes, we built this company for the most part through a series of acquisitions. And when you acquire companies, you always acquire excess capacity in manufacturing. And if you'd said, do you have the ideal footprint? If you could start from a clean sheet of paper and redraw it, you never end up in that place if you grow a company through acquisition. And so we're really taking some steps back and saying, what can we do? What would we do if we could start with a clean sheet of paper? How would we draw it up? And from that are coming new ideas and opportunities to do it smarter, to do it better, to do it more efficiently. And so we think -- we're encouraged by the fact that our business has had a lot of ideas, a lot of recommendations around things that we can do to continue to improve our margins.

And that's really what's plated to a lot of our thinking around Q4 and perhaps playing into 2017. So we still see, if you think about the walk-throughs to our markets, we think the industrial piece, the manufacturing sector, things that have to do with capital spending continue to be weak. And we see those markets to be down kind of low to mid-single digit this year. Oil and gas continue to be weak. Yes. The rig count has increased. But we've not yet seen any of that play through any strength in oil and gas. In fact, the data was a little bit weaker in Q3 than it had been year-to-date. And so we continue to see weakness on the industrial side of the house. But having said that, we're seeing strength on the consumer side. Residential housing, the lighting market continues to do well. The vehicle markets around the world continue to perform well. The light end of nonresi construction, things that are really -- the small strip and really the I'd say almost attach to household formations. So it really depends upon what part of the economy you're serving. And there's pockets of strength work and then there's pockets of weakness. And unfortunately today, the weakness is slightly outweigh the positives, but it really is 2 different pictures, depending on which part of the economy you're sitting on.

And it's kind of the piece that we're working through right now with respect to what the 2017 outlook is going to look like for the company and for our individual businesses. And I'd say at this juncture, we would prefer to defer that question given a number of mixed signals that we saw coming through the data set in Q3. I will say that the general trends around strength in commercial side of the Aerospace and the backlog that Boeing and Airbus has is nothing that would suggest that, that doesn't continue to be a strength. And consumers continue to get on planes and fly and revenue passenger miles were quite frankly, quite strong throughout Q3 growing at 4% in both the Europe and the U.S. and almost 8% in Asia. So that piece of the business feels like it's holding up pretty well. We continue to see weakness on the military side. And so we really would prefer to defer that in terms of our thinking how all of that piece is going to come together, but it's pretty much playing out as expected other than as we've noted in Aerospace, we saw much greater weakness in bizjet and refill jet than we anticipated. We and the others in the industry, quite frankly. And so that's the piece of the little bit fell out a bit on us this year in the Aerospace market. In Hydraulics. I'd say once again, a lot of mix data. I mean, you follow all the same customers that we follow. And you see some of the big construction equipment guys. And it doesn't look like things are getting better. They too, are serving a lot of the industrial markets that are a function of capital spending. And those markets, throughout Q3, it looks like perhaps we're bouncing along the bottom here. But tough to call a turn in Hydraulics market at this point, as well. And so what we hope to learn more as we come to Q4. But at this point, I think in Hydraulics for certain, it's tough to say that we've seen a turn in the market and that we can begin to count on the markets turning positive."

I know that most of you have worked through the earnings release and the details of our earnings already as I've seen a number of your reports already. So what I'll try to do this morning is hit the highlights and then maybe add some color commentary in and around the results. 
First of all, you noted that EPS did come in at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15 and we're actually pleased with these results despite revenue coming in weaker than what we expected. We actually delivered strong operating margins at 16% -- 16.5%, excluding restructuring, in largely as a result of better restructuring benefits and good cost control across the company. 
We had another strong cash quarter. Cash flows were $798 million in the quarter. Our cash conversion ratios within the quarter were 130%, driven by strong margins and the benefits of amortization. Year-to-date, our cash conversion ratio is 110%. We took advantage of our strong cash position and we've repurchased 3.7 million shares, $243 million in the quarter. And this brings our full year repurchases to 9.2 million shares or $560 million versus our target of $700 million for the year. 
Turning to Page 4, financial summary. As we said, total revenues in the quarter came in weaker than we expected. If you recall from our earlier guidance, we expected Q3 revenues would be flat with Q2, and organic revenues actually came in down 1% with less seasonal growth in both of our electrical segments as well as weaker sales in Aerospace and Vehicle. Revenue is 4% lower than prior year with 3% of that coming from lower organic revenues. 
We did have strong operating performance, as I mentioned in the quarter. A couple points of reference for you. In comparison with Q2, we delivered $20 million more of additional segment operating profits or $93 million of lower revenue. And excluding restructuring costs, the improvement in profit was $7 million on, once again, $93 million of lower revenue. And one more comparison point for you when you compare with Q3 of '15, excluding restructuring costs, we delivered strong decremental performance. Profits were actually down some $27 million on $216 million of lower revenue, a 12% decremental rate. So we continue to think that the businesses are executing extraordinary well in a tough revenue environment.  And as a result, we were able to deliver a small improvement in segment margins, despite the decline in revenue. 
And turning our attention to the segments, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Here our revenues were flat year-on-year, but down 1% versus Q2, largely on currency and continued weakness in our industrial markets. Areas of strength included LED lighting, up mid-double-digits with LEDs sales now accounting for 68% of our total lighting revenue. Residential construction was up mid-single digits year-on-year as well. And the key area of weakness here really is -- continues to be industrial controls and the components that we make in our Electrical Products business that are actually sold through the assembly side of our house. So really, a continuation of the trend that we've seen all year. 
Margins continue to be strong at 18.8%. And if you take a look at bookings, bookings were down 1% in the quarter, a little better than last quarter where we're down 2%, but certainly not up to the expectation that we had with strength in lighting, in residential markets, strength in the Middle East, Western Europe and continued weakness, as I noted, in industrial controls. In Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, 2% organically versus Q3 of '15. And essentially, flat sequentially from Q2. You will recall that in Q2, our bookings were down 2%. So we've clearly seen a bit of deterioration in this segment as bookings were down 5% in Q3 driven by, once again, a continuation of a pattern that we've seen all year. Continued weakness in industrial projects in oil and gas offset by some strength in U.S. light commercial markets, Asia Pacific, Northern Europe. But clearly, these areas of strength were not large enough to offset the declines in the other markets. 
Margins were 14.2%, excluding restructuring costs and up from both prior year in Q2, really reflecting the benefits of the restructuring work that's going on across the company and in the segment. In the Hydraulics segment, revenues were down 6% from prior year and down 5% from Q2. This Q2 to Q3 change is seasonality and is really consistent with prior year, so not at all unexpected. Q3 revenue shows about equal weakness in both OEM and distribution. And within the OEM channel, stationary was down more than the mobile side of the business, largely as a result of the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. Bookings declined 3% in the quarter, very similar to the levels that we've seen in Q2 which were down 2%. But here, we do see some differences between OEM and distribution, with OEM orders up 2% and distribution orders down 8%. We're once again very pleased with our margins, which came in at 10.9% and 12.6%, excluding restructuring. 
In Aerospace, revenues were flat organically and down 3% excluding FX, and the FX impact was entirely the result of the lower British pound. Revenues were down 2% from Q2 and down 1% organically from Q2. Encouragingly, we once again, saw very strong margins which were 20% in our Aerospace segment and also strong quarterly bookings. Bookings were up some 15% in the quarter with continued strength in both commercial and military OEM, partially offset by continued weakness in business and regional jet activity. Aftermarket bookings were also up 5% in the quarter with particular strength on the commercial side. 
And in the Vehicle segment. Revenues were down 12% year-on-year driven principally by the large decline that we're seeing in the NAFTA heavy-duty truck market. Production was down some 35% in Q3. Revenues were also down 5% versus Q2. And so we now expect the NAFTA heavy-duty truck production to be approximately 225,000 units this year versus our prior thinking of 230,000 units. Passenger Vehicle sales in the quarter remained strong with particular strength in China and modest strength in Europe. And in margins, while certainly below prior year, remain at attractive levels at 15.5% and 15.2%, excluding restructuring. And if we take a look at the balance of the year, what we're really seeing here is industrial weakness, and an industrial weakness that is continuing. And so we now have updated our overall revenue forecast to be down 4% for the year. And so we're really thinking that the year now comes in at the lower end of our guidance. 
And as you'll note from the chart on Page 10, we did, in fact, make a number of meaningful adjustments to our full year outlook, and I'll walk you through some of the detail here and some of the drivers. First in Electrical Products. We took our mid- to midpoint of our guidance down 1.5 points, and this is principally due to industrial weakness in industrial components and industrial products such as fuses and structural support products, and as well as some softness in some particular geographies, notably, in the Middle East and Canada. In Electrical Systems & Services, some tuning here. We took our guidance down 0.5 basis points. And this is principally a result of continued weakness in the oil and gas projects, including the Middle East. And then large industrial project activity slowed even more than what we anticipated in the quarter. 
In Hydraulics, the one segment where we're actually taking our revenue guidance up for the year, up 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of what we're seeing a stabilization in China and what we think is a bit of an inventory correction that's taking place in some of our customers and some of our markets. In Aerospace, we took the guidance down 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of ongoing weakness in business and regional jet and lower military spending. And then lastly, in Vehicles. A couple of point reduction in our guidance for the year. And this is 100% a result of the ongoing weakness that we're seeing in the heavy-duty truck market and the reduction in the market from 230,000 to 225,000 units. And that all cascades through the company's revenue being down some 1% from prior guidance. 
If we turn our attention to Page 11, restructuring. We're pleased to report that restructuring plan is going well. Costs are essentially coming in at plan levels at $145 million. We spent some $23 million in Q3 versus our original expectation of spending $27 million, and this is largely due to some timing. And we think, at this point, Q4 will be $24 million versus our previous guidance of $20 million, so a little bit of a flip between the quarters. We are, in fact, seeing benefits coming in slightly better than what we anticipated at $200 million for the year versus our previous guide of $190 million, and we saw these benefits largely come through in Q3. And a result of that is, clearly, we're updating our segment margin expectations for the year as well. 
And as a result of lower revenue and the decremental on that end, and so a slightly different mix of restructuring in some of the businesses. We're also updating our full year forecast for segment margins. For Eaton, overall, as you can see on this chart, it results in a 40 basis point reduction in operating margin versus our prior guidance. And then if you just look at the different businesses, quickly I'll walk through them, Electrical Products up slightly, basically, on expectation. In Electrical Systems & Services, a 30 basis point reduction, and that's essentially decremental on the change in revenue. In Hydraulics, 2 things going on here actually. One is higher restructuring cost in our Hydraulics business than we originally planned. And then secondly, a little bit of a mix issue in terms of the mix between the OEM channel and the distribution channel that's playing through. And as I think, most of you are aware, margins tend to be higher in the distribution channel than on the OEM channel. 
And in Aerospace, we're taking our margins up for the year, a 90 basis point increase. And 2 things really driving this change: One is timing and programs spending. Program costs as you know, tend to be lumpy over time. And then a little bit lower restructuring costs in Aerospace. And then lastly, in Vehicle. It's principally a function of lower volume and mix as most of the volume reduction is coming in the North America heavy-duty Class 8 market, which tends to be a little bit more profitable than the rest of the business overall. And so once again, that will cascade through to a 40 basis point reduction. 
If we take a look at our guidance and the outlook for Q4. And as you -- as we reported, we now expect revenues to be down 1.5 points from Q3. We expect margins will be between 15.4% and 15.8%, driven largely by, once again, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, growth in lighting and some weakness in industrial controls and large industrial projects and continued weakness in oil and gas. And we're reducing our Q4 guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint with a range of $1.05 to $1.15. We expect our tax rates will be between 9% and 10% in Q4. And as we said earlier, for the full year, the updated revenue forecast is that organic growth will now be down 4%. And this $0.10 reduction in Q4 EPS amounts to about a 2% reduction in our EPS for the year and drive the change in the midpoint of our guidance as reported. 
So in summary, the chart that we always provide is a summary of kind of the key assumptions for the year laid out on the chart on Page 14. You can see the assumption on the revenue change. Corporate costs are now forecasted to come in at $90 million below 2015 levels versus the previous guidance of $80 million, so a little bit better cost control and a little bit better benefits and restructuring. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 9% and 10% versus the previous guidance of between 9% and 11%. And you can see the EPS forecast we talked about and cash flow guidance, unchanged. So while we're seeing a little bit lower profit, this is offset by better working capital management. 
So just stepping back from the year and a summary of Q3. We see this period of general weakness in industrial markets continuing. Despite this weakness, we think that our team delivered solid results in Q3. This order weakness, however, that we saw in Q3 is reflected in our Q4 forecast, where we see EPS will be $0.05 below Q3 and $0.10 below our full year guidance. These changes are obviously cascading through, but we do expect to maintain our guidance on cash flow and share repurchase for the year. So if you kind of -- our initial thoughts and a look at 2017, I'd say, while it's difficult to make a call on 2017, we do think this period of market uncertainty and caution on capital spending will extend into 2017. We're clearly dealing with a bit of a 2-speed economy where the consumer side of the markets continue to do well, but industrial markets continue to be weaken and certain at best. 
So in response, as you noted in our earnings release, we're expanding our restructuring program by $50 million in 2017 to $180 million in total. Other areas where we're likely to face a bit of a headwind for 2017, our pension plan discount rate will likely be lower by 25 to 40 basis points. The 2016 discount rate was 4.25%. And the way to think about this is for every 25 basis point decline in the discount rate, it results in a $20 million increase in annual pension expense. We're likely to see slightly higher interest expense in 2017. LIBOR has risen. And as a result, of the change in the money market -- as a result, changes in money market regulations, and this increase is the cost of our floating rate debt. We also potentially have some transitional interest expense related to refinancing some debt in 2017. And then we do expect a slightly higher tax rate as well next year. We certainly remain on track to generate very strong cash flow and we expect cash conversion in 2017 to continue to be above 100%. And this will certainly allow us to stay on track with a share repurchase program that we've announced and to deliver the targets that we've laid out. 
So this concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn it back to Don at this point."

And so we saw, clearly, a weakness there. We saw additional weakness in the North America Class 8 truck market and that's what resulted in us reducing our forecast for that market to 225,000 units, but those are the places where we principally saw the reduction.

And we talked about looking at structural costs inside of our businesses, looking at management layers, span of control, taking out fixed cost, looking at the manufacturing footprint that we have around the world.

A lot of our end markets over this period of time did not perform anywhere close to what our expectations were. So there's a piece of what we're doing that's essentially rightsizing our company given the current revenue in the certain size of commercial and economic activity across our enterprise. And having said that, as you're well aware as well, yes, we built this company, for the most part, through a series of acquisitions. And when you acquire companies, you always acquire excess capacity in manufacturing. And if you'd said, do you have the ideal footprint? If you could start from a clean sheet of paper and redraw it, you never end up in that place if you grow a company through acquisition. And so we're really taking some steps back and saying, what can we do, what would we do if we could start with a clean sheet of paper? How would we draw it up? And from that, are coming new ideas and opportunities to do it smarter, to do it better, to do it more efficiently. And so we think we're encouraged by the fact that our businesses have a lot of ideas and a lot of recommendations around things that we can do to continue to improve our margins, despite the fact that we're working in really tough operating conditions."

We saw a weakening in many of the non-resi markets in Q3. And that's really what's played into a lot of our thinking around Q4 and perhaps playing into 2017. So we still see, if you think about kind of a walk-through our markets, we think the industrial piece, the manufacturing sector, things that have to do with capital spending continue to be weak. And we see those markets to be down kind of low to mid-single digit this year. Oil and gas continue to be weak, yes. The rig count has increased, but we've not yet seen any of that play through any strength in oil and gas. In fact, the data was a little bit weaker in Q3 than it had been year-to-date. And so we continue to see weakness on the industrial side of the house and -- no, but having said that, we're seeing strength on the consumer side. Residential housing, the lighting market continues to do well. The vehicle markets around the world continued to perform well. The light end of non-resi construction, things that are really -- the small strip malls and really that are, I'd say, almost attach to household formations. So it really depends upon what part of the economy you're serving. And there's pockets of strength and there's pockets of weakness. And unfortunately, today, the weakness is slightly outweighing the positives. But it really is 2 different pictures, depending upon which part of the economy you're sitting on.

Whether or not these structural kind of improvements will continue into the future I think it's, once again, another one of these points of uncertainty. They put the stimulus programs in effect for a reason, so they had some underlying concerns. But at this point, we think China had certainly stabilized.

And Eli, I appreciate the question and it's kind of the piece that we're working through right now with respect to what the 2017 outlook is going to look like for the company and for our individual businesses. And I'd say at this juncture, we would prefer to defer that question given a number of mixed signals that we saw coming through the data set in Q3. I will say that the general trends around strength in commercial side of the Aerospace and the backlog that Boeing and Airbus has is nothing that would suggest that, that doesn't continue to be a strength. And consumers continue to get on planes and fly and revenue passenger miles were, quite frankly, quite strong throughout Q3 growing at 4% in both the Europe and the U.S. and almost 8% in Asia. So that piece of the business feels like it's holding up pretty well. We continue to see weakness on the military side and so we really would prefer to defer that in terms of our thinking on how all those pieces are going to come together, but it's pretty much playing out as expected. Other than, as we've noted in Aerospace, we saw much greater weakness in bizjet and regional jet than we anticipated. We and the others in the industry, quite frankly. And so that's the piece that a little bit fell out of bed on us this year in the Aerospace market. In Hydraulics I'd say, once again, a lot of mix data. I mean, you follow all the same customers that we follow. And you see some of the big construction equipment guys and it doesn't look like things are getting better. They, too, are serving a lot of the industrial markets that are a function of capital spending. And those markets, throughout Q3, it looks like perhaps maybe we're bouncing along a bottom here, but tough to call a turn in Hydraulics market at this point as well. And so what we hope to learn more as we come through Q4. But at this point, I think in Hydraulics, for certain, it's tough to say that we've seen the turn in the market and that we can begin to count on the markets turning positive."

What we do here pretty consistently is it's a pretty uncertain period of time that we're dealing in.

I know that most of you have worked through the earnings release and the details of our earnings already as I've seen a number of your reports already. So what I'll try to do this morning is hit the highlights and then maybe add some color commentary in and around the results. 
First of all, you noted that EPS did come in at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15 and we're actually pleased with these results despite revenue coming in weaker than what we expected. We actually delivered strong operating margins at 16% -- 16.5%, excluding restructuring, in largely as a result of better restructuring benefits and good cost control across the company. 
We had another strong cash quarter. Cash flows were $798 million in the quarter. Our cash conversion ratios in the quarter were 130%, driven by strong margins and the benefits of amortization. Year-to-date, our cash conversion ratio is 110%. We took advantage of our strong cash position, and we've repurchased 3.7 million shares, $243 million in the quarter. And this brings our full year repurchases to 9.2 million shares or $560 million versus our target of $700 million for the year. 
Turning to Page 4, financial summary. As we said, total revenues in the quarter came in weaker than we expected. If you recall from our earlier guidance, we expected Q3 revenues would be flat with Q2, and organic revenues actually came in down 1% with less seasonal growth in both of our electrical segments as well as weaker sales in Aerospace and Vehicle. Revenue is 4% lower than prior year with 3% of that coming from lower organic revenues. 
We did have strong operating performance, as I mentioned in the quarter. A couple points of reference for you. In comparison with Q2, we delivered $20 million more of additional segment operating profits on $93 million of lower revenue. And excluding restructuring costs, the improvement in profit was $7 million on, once again, $93 million of lower revenue. And one more comparison point for you when you compare with Q3 of '15, excluding restructuring costs, we delivered strong decremental performance. Profits were actually down some $27 million on $216 million of lower revenue, a 12% decremental rate. So we continue to think that the businesses are executing extraordinary well in a tough revenue environment.  And as a result, we were able to deliver a small improvement in segment margins, despite the decline in revenue. 
And turning our attention to the segments, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Here our revenues were flat year-on-year, but down 1% versus Q2, largely on currency and continued weakness in our industrial markets. Areas of strength included LED lighting, up mid-double-digits with LEDs sales now accounting for 68% of our total lighting revenue. Residential construction was up mid-single digits year-on-year as well. And the key area of weakness here really is -- continues to be industrial controls and the components that we make in our Electrical Products business that are actually sold through the assembly side of our house. So really, a continuation of the trend that we've seen all year. 
Margins continue to be strong at 18.8%. And if you take a look at bookings, bookings were down 1% in the quarter, a little better than last quarter where we were down 2%, but certainly not up to the expectation that we had with strength in lighting, in residential markets, strength in the Middle East, Western Europe and continued weakness, as I noted, in industrial controls. In Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, 2% organically versus Q3 of '15. And essentially, flat sequentially from Q2. You will recall that in Q2, our bookings were down 2%. So we've clearly seen a bit of deterioration in this segment as bookings were down 5% in Q3, driven by, once again, a continuation of a pattern that we've seen all year. Continued weakness in industrial projects in oil and gas offset by some strength in U.S. light commercial markets, Asia Pacific, Northern Europe. But clearly, these areas of strength were not large enough to offset the declines in the other markets. 
Margins were 14.2%, excluding restructuring costs and up from both prior year in Q2, really reflecting the benefits of the restructuring work that's going on across the company and in the segment. In the Hydraulics segment, revenues were down 6% from prior year and down 5% from Q2. This Q2 to Q3 change is seasonality and is really consistent with prior year, so not at all unexpected. Q3 revenue shows about equal weakness in both OEM and distribution. And within the OEM channel, stationary was down more than the mobile side of the business, largely as a result of the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. Bookings declined 3% in the quarter, very similar to the levels that we've seen in Q2, which were down 2%. But here, we do see some differences between OEM and distribution, with OEM orders up 2% and distribution orders down 8%. We're once again very pleased with our margins, which came in at 10.9%, and 12.6% excluding restructuring. 
In Aerospace, revenues were flat organically and down 3% excluding FX, and the FX impact was entirely the result of the lower British pound. Revenues were down 2% from Q2 and down 1% organically from Q2. Encouragingly, we once again saw very strong margins which were 20% in our Aerospace segment and also strong quarterly bookings. Bookings were up some 15% in the quarter with continued strength in both commercial and military OEM, partially offset by continued weakness in business and regional jet activity. Aftermarket bookings were also up 5% in the quarter with particular strength on the commercial side. 
And in the Vehicle segment. Revenues were down 12% year-on-year driven principally by the large decline that we're seeing in the NAFTA heavy-duty truck market. Production was down some 35% in Q3. Revenues were also down 5% versus Q2. And so we now expect the NAFTA heavy-duty truck production to be approximately 225,000 units this year versus our prior thinking of 230,000 units. Passenger Vehicle sales in the quarter remained strong with particular strength in China and modest strength in Europe. And in margins, while certainly below prior year, remain at attractive levels at 15.5% and 15.2%, excluding restructuring. And if we take a look at the balance of the year, what we're really seeing here is industrial weakness, and an industrial weakness that is continuing. And so we now have updated our overall revenue forecast to be down 4% for the year. And so we're really thinking that the year now comes in at the lower end of our guidance. 
And as you'll note from the chart on Page 10, we did, in fact, make a number of meaningful adjustments to our full year outlook, and I'll walk you through some of the detail here and some of the drivers. First in Electrical Products. We took our mid -- the midpoint of our guidance down 1.5 points, and this is principally due to industrial weakness in industrial components and industrial products such as fuses and structural support products, and as well as some softness in some particular geographies, notably in the Middle East and Canada. In Electrical Systems & Services, some tuning here. We took our guidance down 0.5 basis points. And this is principally a result of continued weakness in the oil and gas projects, including the Middle East. And then large industrial project activity slowed even more than what we anticipated in the quarter. 
In Hydraulics, the one segment where we're actually taking our revenue guidance up for the year, up 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of what we're seeing as stabilization in China and what we think is a bit of an inventory correction that's taking place in some of our customers and some of our markets. In Aerospace, we took the guidance down 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of ongoing weakness in business and regional jet and lower military spending. And then lastly, in Vehicles. A couple of point reduction in our guidance for the year. And this is 100% a result of the ongoing weakness that we're seeing in the heavy-duty truck market and the reduction in the market from 230,000 to 225,000 units. And that all cascades through to the company's revenue being down some 1% from prior guidance. 
If we turn our attention to Page 11, restructuring. We're pleased to report that restructuring plan is going well. Costs are essentially coming in at planned levels at $145 million. We spent some $23 million in Q3 versus our original expectation of spending $27 million, and this is largely due to some timing. And we think, at this point, Q4 will be $24 million versus our previous guidance of $20 million, so a little bit of a flip between the quarters. We are, in fact, seeing benefits coming in slightly better than what we anticipated at $200 million for the year versus our previous guide of $190 million, and we saw these benefits largely come through in Q3. And a result of that is, clearly, we're updating our segment margin expectations for the year as well, and as a result of lower revenue and the decremental on that end, and so a slightly different mix of restructuring in some of the businesses. We're also updating our full year forecast for segment margins. For Eaton, overall, as you can see on this chart, it results in a 40 basis point reduction in operating margin versus our prior guidance. And then if you just look at the different businesses, quickly I'll walk through them, Electrical Products up slightly, basically, on expectation. In Electrical Systems & Services, a 30 basis point reduction, and that's essentially decremental on the change in revenue. In Hydraulics, 2 things going on here actually. One is higher restructuring cost in our Hydraulics business than we originally planned. And then secondly, a little bit of a mix issue in terms of the mix between the OEM channel and the distribution channel that's playing through. And as I think most of you are aware, margins tend to be higher in the distribution channel than on the OEM channel. 
And in Aerospace, we're taking our margins up for the year, a 90 basis point increase. And 2 things really driving this change. One is timing on program spending. Program costs as you know, tend to be lumpy over time. And then a little bit lower restructuring costs in Aerospace. And then lastly, in Vehicle, it's principally a function of lower volume and mix as most of the volume reduction is coming in the North America heavy-duty Class 8 market, which tends to be a little bit more profitable than the rest of the business overall. And so once again, that will cascade through to a 40 basis point reduction. 
If we take a look at our guidance and the outlook for Q4. And as you -- as we reported, we now expect revenues to be down 1.5 points from Q3. We expect margins will be between 15.4% and 15.8%, driven largely by, once again, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, growth in lighting and some weakness in industrial controls and large industrial projects and continued weakness in oil and gas. And we're reducing our Q4 guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint with a range of $1.05 to $1.15. We expect our tax rates will be between 9% and 10% in Q4. And as we said earlier, for the full year, the updated revenue forecast is that organic growth will now be down 4%. And this $0.10 reduction in Q4 EPS amounts to about a 2% reduction in our EPS for the year and drive the change in the midpoint of our guidance as reported. 
So in summary, the chart that we always provide is a summary of kind of the key assumptions for the year laid out on the chart on Page 14. You can see the assumption on the revenue change. Corporate costs are now forecasted to come in at $90 million below 2015 levels versus the previous guidance of $80 million, so a little bit better cost control and a little bit better benefits and restructuring. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 9% and 10% versus the previous guidance of between 9% and 11%. And you can see the EPS forecast we talked about and cash flow guidance, unchanged. So while we're seeing a little bit lower profits, this is offset by better working capital management. 
So just stepping back from the year and a summary of Q3. We see this period of general weakness in industrial markets continuing. Despite this weakness, we think that our team delivered solid results in Q3. This order weakness, however, that we saw in Q3 is reflected in our Q4 forecast, where we see EPS will be $0.05 below Q3 and $0.10 below our full year guidance. These changes are obviously cascading through, but we do expect to maintain our guidance on cash flow and share repurchase for the year. So if you kind of -- our initial thoughts and a look at 2017, I'd say, while it's difficult to make a call on 2017, we do think this period of market uncertainty and caution on capital spending will extend into 2017. We're clearly dealing with a bit of a 2-speed economy where the consumer side of the markets continue to do well, but industrial markets continue to be weak and uncertain at best. 
So in response, as you noted in our earnings release, we're expanding our restructuring program by $50 million in 2017 to $180 million total. Other areas where we're likely to face a bit of a headwind for 2017, our pension plan discount rate will likely be lower by 25 to 40 basis points. The 2016 discount rate was 4.25%. And the way to think about this is for every 25 basis point decline in the discount rate, it results in a $20 million increase in annual pension expense. We're likely to see slightly higher interest expense in 2017. LIBOR has risen. And as a result, of the change in the money market -- as a result, changes in money market regulations, and this increases the cost of our floating rate debt. We also potentially have some transitional interest expense related to refinancing some debt in 2017. And then we do expect a slightly higher tax rate as well next year. We certainly remain on track to generate very strong cash flow, and we expect cash conversion in 2017 to continue to be above 100%. And this will certainly allow us to stay on track with a share repurchase program that we've announced and to deliver the targets that we've laid out. 
So this concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn it back to Don at this point."

We saw additional weakness in the North America Class 8 truck market and that's what resulted in us reducing our forecast for that market to 225,000 units, but those are the places where we principally saw the reduction.

A lot of our end markets over this period of time did not perform anywhere close to what our expectations were. So there's a piece of what we're doing that's essentially rightsizing our company given the current revenue and the certain size of commercial and economic activity across our enterprise. And having said that, as you're well aware as well, yes, we built this company, for the most part, through a series of acquisitions. And when you acquire companies, you always acquire excess capacity in manufacturing. And if you'd said, do you have the ideal footprint? If you could start from a clean sheet of paper and redraw it, you never end up in that place if you grow a company through acquisition. And so we're really taking some steps back and saying, what can we do, what would we do if we could start with a clean sheet of paper? How would we draw it up? And from that are coming new ideas and opportunities to do it smarter, to do it better, to do it more efficiently. And so we think we're encouraged by the fact that our businesses have a lot of ideas and a lot of recommendations around things that we can do to continue to improve our margins despite the fact that we're working in really tough operating conditions."

We saw a weakening in many of the non-resi markets in Q3. And that's really what's played into a lot of our thinking around Q4 and perhaps playing into 2017. So we still see, if you think about kind of a walk through our markets, we think the industrial piece, the manufacturing sector, things that have to do with capital spending continue to be weak. And we see those markets to be down kind of low to mid-single digit this year. Oil and gas continue to be weak, yes. The rig count has increased, but we've not yet seen any of that play through to any strength in oil and gas. In fact, the data was a little bit weaker in Q3 than it had been year-to-date. And so we continue to see weakness on the industrial side of the house and -- no, but having said that, we're seeing strength on the consumer side. Residential housing, the lighting market continues to do well. The vehicle markets around the world continue to perform well. The light end of non-resi construction, things that are really -- the small strip malls and really that are, I'd say, almost attach to household formations. So it really depends upon what part of the economy you're serving. And there's pockets of strength and there's pockets of weakness. And unfortunately, today, the weakness is slightly outweighing the positives. But it really is 2 different pictures, depending upon which part of the economy you're sitting on.

They put the stimulus programs in effect for a reason, so they had some underlying concerns. But at this point, we think China has certainly stabilized.

And Eli, I appreciate the question and it's kind of the piece that we're working through right now with respect to what the 2017 outlook is going to look like for the company and for our individual businesses. And I'd say at this juncture, we would prefer to defer that question given a number of mixed signals that we saw coming through the data set in Q3. I will say that the general trends around strength in commercial side of the Aerospace and the backlog that Boeing and Airbus has is nothing that would suggest that, that doesn't continue to be a strength. And consumers continue to get on planes and fly and revenue passenger miles were, quite frankly, quite strong throughout Q3 growing at 4% in both the Europe and the U.S. and almost 8% in Asia. So that piece of the business feels like it's holding up pretty well. We continue to see weakness on the military side and so we really would prefer to defer that in terms of our thinking on how all those pieces are going to come together, but it's pretty much playing out as expected. Other than, as we've noted in Aerospace, we saw much greater weakness in bizjet and regional jet than we anticipated. We and the others in the industry, quite frankly. And so that's the piece that a little bit fell out of bed on us this year in the Aerospace market. In Hydraulics I'd say, once again, a lot of mix data. I mean, you follow all the same customers that we follow. And you see some of the big construction equipment guys and it doesn't look like things are getting better. They, too, are serving a lot of the industrial markets that are a function of capital spending. And those markets, throughout Q3, it looks like perhaps maybe we're bouncing along a bottom here, but tough to call a turn in Hydraulics market at this point as well. And so what we hope to learn more as we come through Q4. But at this point, I think in Hydraulics, for certain, it's tough to say that we've seen the turn in the market and that we can begin to count on the markets turning positive."

I know that most of you have worked through the earnings release and the details of our earnings already as I've seen a number of your reports already. So what I'll try to do this morning is hit the highlights and then maybe add some color commentary in and around the results. 
First of all, you noted that EPS did come in at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15 and we're actually pleased with these results despite revenue coming in weaker than what we expected. We actually delivered strong operating margins at 16% -- 16.5%, excluding restructuring, in largely as a result of better restructuring benefits and good cost control across the company. 
We had another strong cash quarter. Cash flows were $798 million in the quarter. Our cash conversion ratios in the quarter were 130%, driven by strong margins and the benefits of amortization. Year-to-date, our cash conversion ratio is 110%. We took advantage of our strong cash position, and we've repurchased 3.7 million shares, $243 million in the quarter. And this brings our full year repurchases to 9.2 million shares or $560 million versus our target of $700 million for the year. 
Turning to Page 4, financial summary. As we said, total revenues in the quarter came in weaker than we expected. If you recall from our earlier guidance, we expected Q3 revenues would be flat with Q2, and organic revenues actually came in down 1% with less seasonal growth in both of our electrical segments as well as weaker sales in Aerospace and Vehicle. Revenue is 4% lower than prior year with 3% of that coming from lower organic revenues. 
We did have strong operating performance, as I mentioned in the quarter. A couple points of reference for you. In comparison with Q2, we delivered $20 million more of additional segment operating profits on $93 million of lower revenue. And excluding restructuring costs, the improvement in profit was $7 million on, once again, $93 million of lower revenue. And one more comparison point for you when you compare with Q3 of '15, excluding restructuring costs, we delivered strong decremental performance. Profits were actually down some $27 million on $216 million of lower revenue, a 12% decremental rate. So we continue to think that the businesses are executing extraordinary well in a tough revenue environment.  And as a result, we were able to deliver a small improvement in segment margins, despite the decline in revenue. 
And turning our attention to the segments, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Here our revenues were flat year-on-year, but down 1% versus Q2, largely on currency and continued weakness in our industrial markets. Areas of strength included LED lighting, up mid-double-digits with LEDs sales now accounting for 68% of our total lighting revenue. Residential construction was up mid-single digits year-on-year as well. And the key area of weakness here really is -- continues to be industrial controls and the components that we make in our Electrical Products business that are actually sold through the assembly side of our house. So really, a continuation of the trend that we've seen all year. 
Margins continue to be strong at 18.8%. And if you take a look at bookings, bookings were down 1% in the quarter, a little better than last quarter where we were down 2%, but certainly not up to the expectation that we had with strength in lighting, in residential markets, strength in the Middle East, Western Europe and continued weakness, as I noted, in industrial controls. In Electrical Systems & Services. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, 2% organically versus Q3 of '15. And essentially, flat sequentially from Q2. You will recall that in Q2, our bookings were down 2%. So we've clearly seen a bit of deterioration in this segment as bookings were down 5% in Q3, driven by, once again, a continuation of a pattern that we've seen all year. Continued weakness in industrial projects in oil and gas offset by some strength in U.S. light commercial markets, Asia Pacific, Northern Europe. But clearly, these areas of strength were not large enough to offset the declines in the other markets. 
Margins were 14.2%, excluding restructuring costs and up from both prior year in Q2, really reflecting the benefits of the restructuring work that's going on across the company and in the segment. In the Hydraulics segment, revenues were down 6% from prior year and down 5% from Q2. This Q2 to Q3 change is seasonality and is really consistent with prior year, so not at all unexpected. Q3 revenue shows about equal weakness in both OEM and distribution. And within the OEM channel, stationary was down more than the mobile side of the business, largely as a result of the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. Bookings declined 3% in the quarter, very similar to the levels that we've seen in Q2, which were down 2%. But here, we do see some differences between OEM and distribution, with OEM orders up 2% and distribution orders down 8%. We're once again very pleased with our margins, which came in at 10.9%, and 12.6% excluding restructuring. 
In Aerospace, revenues were flat organically and down 3% excluding FX, and the FX impact was entirely the result of the lower British pound. Revenues were down 2% from Q2 and down 1% organically from Q2. Encouragingly, we once again saw very strong margins which were 20% in our Aerospace segment and also strong quarterly bookings. Bookings were up some 15% in the quarter with continued strength in both commercial and military OEM, partially offset by continued weakness in business and regional jet activity. Aftermarket bookings were also up 5% in the quarter with particular strength on the commercial side. 
And in the Vehicle segment. Revenues were down 12% year-on-year driven principally by the large decline that we're seeing in the NAFTA heavy-duty truck market. Production was down some 35% in Q3. Revenues were also down 5% versus Q2. And so we now expect the NAFTA heavy-duty truck production to be approximately 225,000 units this year versus our prior thinking of 230,000 units. Passenger Vehicle sales in the quarter remained strong with particular strength in China and modest strength in Europe. And in margins, while certainly below prior year, remain at attractive levels at 15.5% and 15.2%, excluding restructuring. And if we take a look at the balance of the year, what we're really seeing here is industrial weakness, and an industrial weakness that is continuing. And so we now have updated our overall revenue forecast to be down 4% for the year. And so we're really thinking that the year now comes in at the lower end of our guidance. 
And as you'll note from the chart on Page 10, we did, in fact, make a number of meaningful adjustments to our full year outlook, and I'll walk you through some of the detail here and some of the drivers. First in Electrical Products. We took our mid -- the midpoint of our guidance down 1.5 points, and this is principally due to industrial weakness in industrial components and industrial products such as fuses and structural support products, and as well as some softness in some particular geographies, notably in the Middle East and Canada. In Electrical Systems & Services, some tuning here. We took our guidance down 0.5 basis points. And this is principally a result of continued weakness in the oil and gas projects, including the Middle East. And then large industrial project activity slowed even more than what we anticipated in the quarter. 
In Hydraulics, the one segment where we're actually taking our revenue guidance up for the year, up 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of what we're seeing as stabilization in China and what we think is a bit of an inventory correction that's taking place in some of our customers and some of our markets. In Aerospace, we took the guidance down 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of ongoing weakness in business and regional jet and lower military spending. And then lastly, in Vehicles. A couple of point reduction in our guidance for the year. And this is 100% a result of the ongoing weakness that we're seeing in the heavy-duty truck market and the reduction in the market from 230,000 to 225,000 units. And that all cascades through to the company's revenue being down some 1% from prior guidance. 
If we turn our attention to Page 11, restructuring. We're pleased to report that restructuring plan is going well. Costs are essentially coming in at planned levels at $145 million. We spent some $23 million in Q3 versus our original expectation of spending $27 million, and this is largely due to some timing. And we think, at this point, Q4 will be $24 million versus our previous guidance of $20 million, so a little bit of a flip between the quarters. We are, in fact, seeing benefits coming in slightly better than what we anticipated at $200 million for the year versus our previous guide of $190 million, and we saw these benefits largely come through in Q3. And a result of that is, clearly, we're updating our segment margin expectations for the year as well, and as a result of lower revenue and the decremental on that end, and so a slightly different mix of restructuring in some of the businesses. We're also updating our full year forecast for segment margins. For Eaton, overall, as you can see on this chart, it results in a 40 basis point reduction in operating margin versus our prior guidance. And then if you just look at the different businesses, quickly I'll walk through them, Electrical Products up slightly, basically, on expectation. In Electrical Systems & Services, a 30 basis point reduction, and that's essentially decremental on the change in revenue. In Hydraulics, 2 things going on here actually. One is higher restructuring cost in our Hydraulics business than we originally planned. And then secondly, a little bit of a mix issue in terms of the mix between the OEM channel and the distribution channel that's playing through. And as I think most of you are aware, margins tend to be higher in the distribution channel than on the OEM channel. 
And in Aerospace, we're taking our margins up for the year, a 90 basis point increase. And 2 things really driving this change. One is timing on program spending. Program costs as you know, tend to be lumpy over time. And then a little bit lower restructuring costs in Aerospace. And then lastly, in Vehicle, it's principally a function of lower volume and mix as most of the volume reduction is coming in the North America heavy-duty Class 8 market, which tends to be a little bit more profitable than the rest of the business overall. And so once again, that will cascade through to a 40 basis point reduction. 
If we take a look at our guidance and the outlook for Q4. And as you -- as we reported, we now expect revenues to be down 1.5 points from Q3. We expect margins will be between 15.4% and 15.8%, driven largely by, once again, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, growth in lighting and some weakness in industrial controls and large industrial projects and continued weakness in oil and gas. And we're reducing our Q4 guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint with a range of $1.05 to $1.15. We expect our tax rates will be between 9% and 10% in Q4. And as we said earlier, for the full year, the updated revenue forecast is that organic growth will now be down 4%. And this $0.10 reduction in Q4 EPS amounts to about a 2% reduction in our EPS for the year and drive the change in the midpoint of our guidance as reported. 
So in summary, the chart that we always provide is a summary of kind of the key assumptions for the year laid out on the chart on Page 14. You can see the assumption on the revenue change. Corporate costs are now forecasted to come in at $90 million below 2015 levels versus the previous guidance of $80 million, so a little bit better cost control and a little bit better benefits and restructuring. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 9% and 10% versus the previous guidance of between 9% and 11%. And you can see the EPS forecast we talked about and cash flow guidance, unchanged. So while we're seeing a little bit lower profits, this is offset by better working capital management. 
So just stepping back from the year and a summary of Q3. We see this period of general weakness in industrial markets continuing. Despite this weakness, we think that our team delivered solid results in Q3. This order weakness, however, that we saw in Q3 is reflected in our Q4 forecast, where we see EPS will be $0.05 below Q3 and $0.10 below our full year guidance. These changes are obviously cascading through, but we do expect to maintain our guidance on cash flow and share repurchase for the year. So if you kind of -- our initial thoughts and a look at 2017, I'd say, while it's difficult to make a call on 2017, we do think this period of market uncertainty and caution on capital spending will extend into 2017. We're clearly dealing with a bit of a 2-speed economy where the consumer side of the markets continue to do well, but industrial markets continue to be weak and uncertain at best. 
So in response, as you noted in our earnings release, we're expanding our restructuring program by $50 million in 2017 to $180 million total. Other areas where we're likely to face a bit of a headwind for 2017, our pension plan discount rate will likely be lower by 25 to 40 basis points. The 2016 discount rate was 4.25%. And the way to think about this is for every 25 basis point decline in the discount rate, it results in a $20 million increase in annual pension expense. We're likely to see slightly higher interest expense in 2017. LIBOR has risen. And as a result, of the change in the money market -- as a result, changes in money market regulations, and this increases the cost of our floating rate debt. We also potentially have some transitional interest expense related to refinancing some debt in 2017. And then we do expect a slightly higher tax rate as well next year. We certainly remain on track to generate very strong cash flow, and we expect cash conversion in 2017 to continue to be above 100%. And this will certainly allow us to stay on track with a share repurchase program that we've announced and to deliver the targets that we've laid out. 
So this concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn it back to Don at this point."

And so we saw, clearly, a weakness there. We saw additional weakness in the North America Class 8 truck market and that's what resulted in us reducing our forecast for that market to 225,000 units, but those are the places where we principally saw the reduction. It was really pretty broad across many of the electrical end markets as well as the North America Class 8 truck business."

A lot of our end markets over this period of time did not perform anywhere close to what our expectations were. So there's a piece of what we're doing that's essentially rightsizing our company given the current revenue and the certain size of commercial and economic activity across our enterprise. And having said that, as you're well aware as well, yes, we built this company, for the most part, through a series of acquisitions. And when you acquire companies, you always acquire excess capacity in manufacturing. And if you'd said, do you have the ideal footprint? If you could start from a clean sheet of paper and redraw it, you never end up in that place if you grow a company through acquisition. And so we're really taking some steps back and saying, what can we do, what would we do if we could start with a clean sheet of paper? How would we draw it up? And from that are coming new ideas and opportunities to do it smarter, to do it better, to do it more efficiently. And so we think we're encouraged by the fact that our businesses have a lot of ideas and a lot of recommendations around things that we can do to continue to improve our margins despite the fact that we're working in really tough operating conditions."

We saw a weakening in many of the non-resi markets in Q3. And that's really what's played into a lot of our thinking around Q4 and perhaps playing into 2017. So we still see, if you think about kind of a walk through our markets, we think the industrial piece, the manufacturing sector, things that have to do with capital spending continue to be weak. And we see those markets to be down kind of low to mid-single digit this year. Oil and gas continue to be weak, yes. The rig count has increased, but we've not yet seen any of that play through to any strength in oil and gas. In fact, the data was a little bit weaker in Q3 than it had been year-to-date. And so we continue to see weakness on the industrial side of the house and -- no, but having said that, we're seeing strength on the consumer side. Residential housing, the lighting market continues to do well. The vehicle markets around the world continue to perform well. The light end of non-resi construction, things that are really -- the small strip malls and really that are, I'd say, almost attach to household formations. So it really depends upon what part of the economy you're serving. And there's pockets of strength and there's pockets of weakness. And unfortunately, today, the weakness is slightly outweighing the positives. But it really is 2 different pictures, depending upon which part of the economy you're sitting on.

And Eli, I appreciate the question and it's kind of the piece that we're working through right now with respect to what the 2017 outlook is going to look like for the company and for our individual businesses. And I'd say at this juncture, we would prefer to defer that question given a number of mixed signals that we saw coming through the data set in Q3. I will say that the general trends around strength in commercial side of the Aerospace and the backlog that Boeing and Airbus has is nothing that would suggest that, that doesn't continue to be a strength. And consumers continue to get on planes and fly and revenue passenger miles were, quite frankly, quite strong throughout Q3 growing at 4% in both the Europe and the U.S. and almost 8% in Asia. So that piece of the business feels like it's holding up pretty well. We continue to see weakness on the military side and so we really would prefer to defer that in terms of our thinking on how all those pieces are going to come together, but it's pretty much playing out as expected. Other than, as we've noted in Aerospace, we saw much greater weakness in bizjet and regional jet than we anticipated. We and the others in the industry, quite frankly. And so that's the piece that a little bit fell out of bed on us this year in the Aerospace market. In Hydraulics I'd say, once again, a lot of mix data. I mean, you follow all the same customers that we follow. And you see some of the big construction equipment guys and it doesn't look like things are getting better. They, too, are serving a lot of the industrial markets that are a function of capital spending. And those markets, throughout Q3, it looks like perhaps maybe we're bouncing along a bottom here, but tough to call a turn in Hydraulics market at this point as well. And so what we hope to learn more as we come through Q4. But at this point, I think in Hydraulics, for certain, it's tough to say that we've seen the turn in the market and that we can begin to count on the markets turning positive."

And so that, too, will be a little bit of a headwind as we look at 2017. But at this point, we've not made the final call on the incentive comp plan for 2016."

Craig, can you give me more color on what fresh observations your customers are making to want to defer. I mean, we've been in a very slow CapEx environment for, call it, 2-plus years now. Oil and gas, I think, has shouldered a good amount of the blame for the past year at least. And I get that that's a longer cycle business and some cases of maybe there’s still backlog projects that are bleeding off. But it does seem like the tone from yourselves and a lot of your peers out there is that 3Q took another step down that the driver seem to be unchanged versus what we've seen from past quarters. So just maybe some calibration on what's really new here and is this an election hiccup or anything else that they would point to that would be fresh?"

But we do think this -- the thematic message that cuts through all of these conversations is uncertainty. And if you think about any person running a business today and making a long-term capital commitment in the face of an economic environment and a presidential election that's been as noisy as this one with as much uncertainty around the environment that we're going to be dealing it, it's -- while disappointing, a little bit understandable that companies are basically pausing and waiting to see how things play out before they make a decision around major capital multiyear commitments. And so we think that's probably what's going on. It's -- but once again, we're not 100% certain either. What we do here pretty consistently is it's a pretty uncertain period of time that we're dealing in. And most companies and many companies are cutting their capital budgets and are putting decisions on hold with respect to multiyear commitments."

In historical expansion periods, it's been about a 12-month delay, and we're well into that already where the consumer side of the economy has continued to grow, yet we've not seen the investment in manufacturing in the industrial side of the economy. And that would suggest, perhaps, there is some pent-up demand out there. But once again, we have to wait and see whether or not it actually plays through the way it has historically."
