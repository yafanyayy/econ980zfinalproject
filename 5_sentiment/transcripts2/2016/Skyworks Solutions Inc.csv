We had a solid first quarter performance with revenue profitability and earnings ahead of expectations in spite of the challenging macro environment. As specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue of $927 million, that's up 15% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $367 million, that's up 30% year-over-year, translating into a 39.6% operating margin. And we posted $1.60 in earnings per share that's up 27% versus the prior year. We also generated more than $345 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with just over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and with no debt. This was another well-executed quarter for the Skyworks team. Our content gain, our diversification and our disciplined approach -- disciplined operational focus were key factors in achieving this Q1 results. And as we look ahead, we continue to see tangible opportunities to capitalize on a number of high-level growth trends across the technology landscape. These include growing consumption of wireless data within consumer and enterprise applications, advancements and cloud-based services, the proliferation of connectivity within the emerging markets, and increasing adoption of the Internet of Things. These macro themes are irrefutable and they're far-reaching creating expanding uses of our technology and higher addressable content opportunities with each new product generation. 
Leveraging our industry-leading integration capabilities, we positioned Skyworks to capitalize on these profitable market tailwinds. Now despite these positive long-term drivers, this here the March quarter, which is normally a seasonally soft period, has been impacted by above-normal forecast reductions and inventory adjustments of one of our top customers. This dynamic has been well-documented across the supply chain over the last few weeks. After closely analyzing the market environment, we have adopted and appropriately conservative outlook for our Q2 revenue guidance. However, through strong gross margin performance and a disciplined focus on cost, the overall impact to EPS is relatively small and our guidance represents high single-digit earnings growth on the year-over-year basis. Don will provide more specific later in the call. 
It is worth emphasizing that we're well positioned for a strong second half of calendar '16 based on clear visibility into design wins across our flagship smartphone customers. And from this vantage point, we are highly confident in our prospects for gaining dollar content with an upcoming generation, putting us on track to continue delivering above-market revenue growth with expanding profit margins and earnings leverage. Before providing a more detailed view of the market, I'll turn it over now to Don for a more in-depth review of the financial results."

Thanks for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter was $926.8 million, in line with our guidance and up 15% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $476.1 million or 51.4% of revenue, ahead of guidance and up 470 basis poin",671,"Thanks, Dave. Thanks for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter was $926.8 million, in line with our guidance and up 15% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $476.1 million or 51.4% of revenue, ahead of guidance and up 470 basis points from the quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating expenses were $109.5 million consisting of R&D expenses $71.9 million and SG&A expense of $37.6 million. We generated $366.6 million of operating income, up 30% from the year-ago quarter, translating into a 39.6% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 15% resulting in net income of $311.2 million or $1.60 of diluted earnings per share as compared with diluted EPS of $1.26 in the year-ago quarter. That equates to a 27% year-over-year earnings growth. 
Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we invested $79.5 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $51.5 million. We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations, which includes the $88.5 million termination fee from PMCCR and exited the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt. 
Moving to product mix. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 16% of revenue; integrated mobile systems was 64% and broad markets was 20%. We saw a healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems in broad markets. In fact, IMS was up a full 16 points versus a year ago as a percentage of our mix. Power amplifier products continued to decline as a percentage of our revenue as the market shifts toward higher value integrated solutions. 
Now for our second quarter business outlook. We expect second quarter revenue to be approximately $775 million. We suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 50.5% to 51% with operating expenses flat to Q1 at approximately $109.5 million. It's worth noting that the midpoint of our gross margin guidance range implies over a 400-basis-point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook in the phase of current market dynamics highlights the benefits of our higher value integrated systems, along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations. Looking ahead, we see continued optimally for margin improvement as we leverage our recent capital investment and ramp our customer integrated solutions and precision analogue products. For modeling purposes, we recommend using a 60% incremental gross margin off of the second quarter baseline. We are targeting a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress toward achieving this goal. Below the line, we anticipate $500,000 in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 15%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year. We expect share count to be around 194.5 million shares resulting in second quarter EPS of $1.24, and that's up 8% versus last year. 
Finally, we recently entered into an agreement to divest Tech, a small subsidiary of our to Kia Sarah for roughly $42 million. Transtech produce a ceramic substrates and materials for a number of broad market applications and had become a noncritical -- have become noncritical to our corporate strategy. We expect the transaction to close sometime in early April. For modeling purpose, we recommend assuming around $40 million per quarter of revenue impact starting in the June quarter with no impact to EPS. This transaction helps to improve the financial returns of our business while sharpening focus on our core strategy. Our Q2 margin and EPS guidance highlights the robustness of our business model within the context of a challenging market conditions. For the second half of calendar 2016, we see momentum building off of this baseline. Many of the drivers supporting this are already in place, giving us a high level of confidence to extend our track record of best-in-class financial results. And we remain on track toward our midterm goal of $8 in annualized EPS. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Before closing and taking your questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate a few market realities that will continue to fuel our growth for the coming years. First, demand for wireless data continues to skyrocket, with no end in sight driven by the adoption of streaming media and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. Now these services are in their infancy and consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth, drastically increasing demands our network and on devices. Secondly, growing data consumption requires dramatically higher levels of analogue performance at the semiconductor level. To Improve throughput, our customers are facing mounting technical challenges, including navigating spectrum limitations, improving signal reality -- reliability and mitigating interference, all while extending battery life. The end result is greater addressable content per device and TAM growth well in excess of the semiconductor sector. Third, as the technology integration leader, we are consolidating market share and our visibility to new content wins an future architectures is very strong. The solutions we're developing for future generations are tremendously complex, and they require best-in-class core technologies, advance integration capabilities and deep system-level expertise. Skyworks is uniquely positioned in all these regards to address these opportunities. This focuses -- this fosters closer engagement with customers and higher value solutions across the board, with a narrowing field of capable competitors. And fourth, the Internet of Things is real, and it's happening today, facilitating entirely new growth avenues for us and enhancing our diversification. At his year's Consumer Electronics Show, there is a showcase of groundbreaking new devices leveraging the power of wireless connectivity. Much of the excitement made at CES this year was around innovations in the connected car, in the automated home, wearable technologies and entirely new categories like drones, utilizing enabling technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and others. And we participated at Skyworks in all of these markets to our suite of connectivity solutions. And lastly, we've successfully redefined our business model, combining a strategic focus on higher value-added integrated solutions with unrivaled scale with advanced manufacturing capabilities and deep operational know-how. The end result is that you are consistently delivering among the best financial return in the semiconductor sector in a variety of market conditions. As just one measure of this, our return on invested capital for 2015 was 33% and over the last 2 years, we've averaged 30%. In closing, looking past the near-term volatility, wv created a unique and a robust business model fueled by the proliferation of connectivity and combining above market top-line growth, healthy cash flow and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified company.

There've been other RF 360 components of that system, in which we don't compete with and that success. But these decades of and I performance and driving switch technologies and multi-chip margin technology and getting to put our own high-performance filters has really given us a system-level performance that has not been easy for competition to replicate. We know TDK very well. We've used them in the past, they're mostly saw they've got some limited capabilities involved but remember, I think, as your question alluded to, our customers awarding business based purely performance, and on configurability and what it does at the system level.

We've driven filter cost down dramatically so we're executing as we have for a long time pretty well across all fronts and they're all contributing to the margin story. As far as capacity, we're in really good shape. We've got square footage on a new leased facility in Mexicali. So it's short money for equipment.

We had a solid first quarter performance with revenue profitability and earnings ahead of expectations in spite of the challenging macro environment. Specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue of $927 million, that's up 15% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $367 million, that's up 30% year-over-year, translating into a 39.6% operating margin. And we posted $1.60 in earnings per share that's up 27% versus the prior year. We also generated more than $345 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with just over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and with no debt. This was another well-executed quarter from the Skyworks team. Our content gain, our diversification and our disciplined approach -- disciplined operational focus were key factors in achieving this Q1 results. And as we look ahead, we continue to see tangible opportunities to capitalize on a number of high-level growth trends across the technology landscape. These include growing consumption of wireless data within consumer and enterprise applications, advancements and cloud-based services, the proliferation of connectivity within the emerging markets, and increasing adoption of the Internet of Things. These macro themes are irrefutable and they're far-reaching, creating expanding uses of our technology and higher addressable content opportunities with each new product generation.
Leveraging our industry-leading integration capabilities, we positioned Skyworks to capitalize on these profitable market tailwinds. Now despite these positive long-term drivers, this year the March quarter, which is normally a seasonally soft period, has been impacted by above-normal forecast reductions and inventory adjustments at one of our top customers. This dynamic has been well-documented across the supply chain over the last few weeks. After closely analyzing the market environment, we have adopted and appropriately conservative outlook for our Q2 revenue guidance. However, through strong gross margin performance and a disciplined focus on cost, the overall impact to EPS is relatively small and our guidance represent high single digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Don will provide more specific later in the call. 
It is worth emphasizing that we're well positioned for a strong second half of calendar '16, based on clear visibility into design wins across our flagship smartphone customers. And from this vantage point, we are highly confident in our prospects for gaining dollar content with an upcoming generation, putting us on track to continue delivering above-market revenue growth with expanding profit margins and earnings leverage. Before providing a more detailed view of the market, I'll turn it over now to Don for a more in-depth review of the financial results."

We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations, which includes the $88.5 million termination fee from PMCCR, and exited the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt.
Moving to product mix. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 16% of revenue; integrated mobile systems was 64% and broad markets was 20%. We saw a healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems in broad markets. In fact, IMS was up a full 16 points versus a year ago as a percentage of our mix. Power amplifier products continued to decline as a percentage of our revenue as the market shifts toward higher-value integrated solutions.
Now for our second quarter business outlook. We expect second quarter revenue to be approximately $775 million. We suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 50.5% to 51% with operating expenses flat to Q1 at approximately $109.5 million. It's worth noting that the midpoint of our gross margin guidance range implies over a 400-basis-point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook in the phase of current market dynamics highlight the benefits of our higher-value integrated systems, along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations. Looking ahead, we see continued optimally for margin improvement as we leverage our recent capital investments and ramp our custom integrated solutions and precision analogue products. For modeling purposes, we recommend using a 60% incremental gross margin off of the second quarter baseline. We are targeting a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress toward achieving this goal. Below the line, we anticipate $500,000 in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 15%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year. We expect share count to be around 194.5 million shares resulting in second quarter EPS of $1.24, and that's up 8% versus last year.
Finally, we recently entered into an agreement to divest Trans-Tech, a small subsidiary of ours, to Kyocera for roughly $42 million. Trans-Tech produces ceramic substrates and materials for a number of broad market applications and had become a noncritical -- have become noncritical to our corporate strategy. We expect the transaction to close sometime in early April. For modeling purpose, we recommend assuming around $40 million per quarter of revenue impact starting in the June quarter with no impact to EPS. This transaction helps to improve the financial returns of our business while sharpening focus on our core strategy. Our Q2 margin and EPS guidance highlights the robustness of our business model within the context of a challenging market conditions. For the second half of calendar 2016, we see momentum building off of this baseline. Many of the drivers supporting this are already in place, giving us a high level of confidence to extend our track record of best-in-class financial results. And we remain on track toward our midterm goal of $8 in annualized EPS. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Before closing and taking your questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate a few market realities that will continue to fuel our growth in the coming years. First, demand for wireless data continues to skyrocket, with no end in sight",449,"Thank you, Don. Before closing and taking your questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate a few market realities that will continue to fuel our growth in the coming years. First, demand for wireless data continues to skyrocket, with no end in sight, driven by the adoption of streaming media and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. Now these services are in their infancy and consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth, drastically increasing demands on network and on devices. Secondly, growing data consumption requires dramatically higher levels of analogue performance at the semiconductor level. To improve throughput, our customers are facing mounting technical challenges, including navigating spectrum limitations, improving signal reality -- reliability and mitigating interference, all while extending battery life. The end result is greater addressable content per device and TAM growth well in excess of the semiconductor sector. Third, as a technology integration leader, we are consolidating market share and our visibility to new content wins and future architectures is very strong. The solutions we're developing for future generations are tremendously complex, and they require best-in-class core technologies, advanced integration capabilities and deep system-level expertise. Skyworks is uniquely positioned in all these regards to address these opportunities. This focuses -- this fosters closer engagement with customers and higher-value solutions across the board, with a narrowing field of capable competitors. And fourth, the Internet of Things is real, and it's happening today, facilitating entirely new growth avenues for us and enhancing our diversification. At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, there was a showcase of groundbreaking new devices leveraging the power of wireless connectivity. Much of the excitement at CES this year was around innovations in the connected car, in the automated home, wearable technologies and entirely new categories like drones, utilizing enabling technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and others. And we participated at Skyworks in all of these markets to our suite of connectivity solutions. And lastly, we've successfully redefined our business model, combining a strategic focus on higher value-added integrated solutions with unrivaled scale with advanced manufacturing capabilities and deep operational knowhow. The end result is that we are consistently delivering among the best financial returns in the semiconductor sector in a variety of market conditions. As just one measure of this, our return on invested capital for 2015 was 33% and over the last 2 years, we've averaged 30%.
In closing, looking past the near-term volatility, we've created a unique and a robust business model fueled by the proliferation of connectivity and combining above-market top-line growth, healthy cash flow and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analogue company.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, lets open the lines for questions, please."

And that's real advantage in our system solutions that can be replicated by an RF-only company. So we continue to see that as a real differential advantage for Skyworks."

But you know -- I mentioned carrier aggregation, but what we're really seeing is we can get the performance, for example, on the transmit path or any carrier aggregation system. If we can drive the right topology and the right device performance, we find that it's a little bit less dependent than one normally thinks about the actual filter technology and process that it is about the whole linked budget, that is from the transceiver to the antenna and back. And so we're getting, I mean, some of the power-added efficiency numbers and the current consumption reduction we're getting out of these newest generation SkyOne, skylight, PAD architectures, it really frankly unheard of in the space. And it's not all about the filters, it's much more about the device performance and the way we architect it."

There've been other RF360 components of that system in which we don't compete, where they've had success. But these decades of gallium arsenide performance and driving switch technologies and multi-chip module technology and getting to put our own high-performance filters has really given us a system-level performance that has not been easy for competition to replicate. We know TDK very well. We've used them in the past. They mostly saw they've got some limited capability involved, but remember, I think, as your question alluded to, our customers are awarding business based purely on performance and on configurability and what this -- it does at the system level.

So that's -- you could -- that's mix, but it's not mix. It's real -- it's more value-add integrated solutions, and that's really helping. And it's the things we do on CapEx. It's the things we do on driving productivity improvements through the fab, through the assembly and test operation in Mexicali. We've driven filter cost down dramatically. So we're executing as we have for a long time pretty well across all fronts, and they're all contributing to the margin story. As far as capacity, we're in really good shape. We've got square footage on a new leased facility in Mexicali. So it's short money for equipment. We can expand that very, very quickly. That pays back quickly. Dave already talked about quadrupling the filter capacity as far as square footage in Japan, so with equipment, again, we can do that very quickly. And we've got our outsource partners for a wafer.

So I'm not too worried about any new gas entrant, and I'm definitely not worried about CMOS technology being able to accomplish the kind of current consumption, the kind of transmit requirements that we're seeing across our markets today. Every single time there is an advance in a different technology or with a different competitor, what we're finding is that the next-generation system has increased the bar so high that it doesn't matter that improvement isn't anywhere near capable of delivering a system-level performance that our customer's requiring.

I think, that'll be very good for us. We'll be able to have the enviable trade-off between using SAW, temperature-compensated SAW in bulk devices in using the right application for the function because if you look across the world today, most world phones, most smartphones don't use BAW technologies. They have a different configuration or a different band lineup that doesn't require it. But for those customers who are looking for sort of a low, mid, high, very high performance, truly a world phone, what BAW will do will open up high band for us in which we don't participate, market we do not participate in today. So it'll increase our TAM, and we'll get there by '17."

And all that comes together, and it's worked out great. And TC capabilities that we have today are unbelievable. They're world-class world manufacturer. In this last calendar year, we manufactured about 1.5 billion TC SAWs. All of which were consumed by our integrated system. So we're very bullish on that concept, and we'll continue to use the best technologies to win."

We had a solid first quarter performance with revenue, profitability and earnings ahead of expectations in spite of the challenging macro environment. Now specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue of $927 million, that's up 15% year-over-year. 
We produced operating income of $367 million, that's up 30% year-over-year, translating into a 39.6% operating margin. And we posted $1.60 in earnings per share, that's up 27% versus the prior year. We also generated more than $345 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with just over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and with no debt. 
This was another well-executed quarter from the Skyworks team. Our content gained, our diversification and our disciplined approach -- our disciplined operational focus were key factors in achieving these Q1 results. And as we look ahead, we continue to see tangible opportunities to capitalize on a number of high-level growth trends across the technology landscape. These include growing consumption of wireless data within consumer and enterprise applications, advancements in cloud-based services, the proliferation of connectivity within the emerging markets, and increasing adoption of the Internet of Things. These macro themes are irrefutable and they're far-reaching, creating expanding uses for our technology and higher addressable content opportunities with each new product generation.
Leveraging our industry-leading integration capabilities, we positioned Skyworks to capitalize on these powerful market tailwinds. 
Now despite these positive long-term drivers, this year, the March quarter, which is normally a seasonally soft period, has been impacted by above-normal forecast reductions and inventory adjustments at one of our top customers. This dynamic has been well-documented across the supply chain over the last few weeks. 
After closely analyzing the market environment, we have adopted an appropriately conservative outlook for our Q2 revenue guidance. However, through strong gross margin performance and a disciplined focus on cost, the overall impact to EPS is relatively small. And our guidance represents high single digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Don will provide more specifics later in the call. 
It is worth emphasizing that we're well positioned for a strong second half of calendar '16, based on clear visibility into design wins across our flagship smartphone customers. And from this vantage point, we are highly confident in our prospects for gaining dollar content within upcoming generations, putting us on track to continue delivering above-market revenue growth with expanding profit margins and earnings leverage. 
Before providing a more detailed view of the market, I'll turn it over now to Don for a more in-depth review of the financial results."

Thanks for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter was $926.8 million, in line with our guidance and up 15% versus the year-ago quarter.

Revenue for the first quarter was $926.8 million, in line with our guidance and up 15% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $476.1 million or 51.4% of revenue, ahead of guidance and up 470 basis points from the quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating expenses were $109.5 million, consisting of R&D expense of $71.9 million and SG&A expense of $37.6 million. 
We generated $366.6 million of operating income, up 30% from the year-ago quarter, translating into a 39.6% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 15%, resulting in net income of $311.2 million or $1.60 of diluted earnings per share, as compared with diluted EPS of $1.26 in the year-ago quarter. That equates to a 27% year-over-year earnings growth.
Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we invested $79.5 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $51.5 million. We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations, which includes the $88.5 million termination fee from PMC-Sierra, and exited the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt.
Moving to product mix. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 16% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 64% and broad markets was 20%. We saw healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems and broad markets. In fact, IMS was up a full 16 points versus a year ago as a percentage of our mix. Power amplifier products continue to decline as a percentage of our revenue, as the market shifts toward higher-value integrated solutions.
Now for our second quarter business outlook. We expect second quarter revenue to be approximately $775 million. We suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 50.5% to 51% with operating expenses flat to Q1 at approximately $109.5 million. 
It's worth noting that the midpoint of our gross margin guidance range implies over a 400-basis-point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook in the face of current market dynamics highlights the benefits of our higher-value integrated systems, along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations. 
Looking ahead, we see continued opportunity for margin improvement, as we leverage our recent capital investments and ramp our custom integrated solutions and precision analog products. For modeling purposes, we recommend using a 60% incremental gross margin off of the second quarter baseline. We are targeting a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress toward achieving this goal. 
Below the line, we anticipate $500,000 in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 15%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year. We expect share count to be around 194.5 million shares, resulting in second quarter EPS of $1.24, and that's up 8% versus last year.
Finally, we recently entered into an agreement to divest Trans-Tech, a small subsidiary of ours, to Kyocera for roughly $42 million. Trans-Tech produces ceramic substrates and materials for a number of broad market applications and had become a noncritical -- had become noncritical to our corporate strategy. We expect the transaction to close sometime in early April. For modeling purpose, we recommend assuming around $14 million per quarter of revenue impact, starting in the June quarter with no impact to EPS. This transaction helps to improve the financial returns of our business, while sharpening focus on our core strategy. 
Our Q2 margin and EPS guidance highlights the robustness of our business model within the context of challenging market conditions. For the second half of calendar 2016, we see momentum building off of this baseline. Many of the drivers supporting this are already in place, giving us a high level of confidence to extend our track record of best-in-class financial results. And we remain on track toward our midterm goal of $8 in annualized EPS. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

First, demand for wireless data continues to skyrocket, with no end in sig",450,"Thank you, Don. Before closing and taking your questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate a few market realities that will continue to fuel our growth in the coming years. 
First, demand for wireless data continues to skyrocket, with no end in sight, driven by the adoption of streaming media and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. Now these services are in their infancy and consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth, drastically increasing demands on network and on devices. 
Secondly, growing data consumption requires dramatically higher levels of analog performance at the semiconductor level. To improve throughput, our customers are facing mounting technical challenges, including navigating spectrum limitations, improving signal reality -- reliability and mitigating interference, all while extending battery life. The end result is greater addressable content per device, and TAM growth well in excess of the semiconductor sector. 
Third, as a technology integration leader, we are consolidating market share. And our visibility to new content wins and future architectures is very strong. The solutions we're developing for future generations are tremendously complex. And they require best-in-class core technologies, advanced integration capabilities and deep system-level expertise. Skyworks is uniquely positioned in all these regards to address these opportunities. This focuses -- this fosters closer engagement with customers and higher-value solutions across the board with a narrowing field of capable competitors. 
And fourth, the Internet of Things is real, and it's happening today, facilitating entirely new growth avenues for us and enhancing our diversification. At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, there was a showcase of groundbreaking new devices, leveraging the power of wireless connectivity. Much of the excitement at CES this year was around innovations in the connected car, in the automated home, wearable technologies and entirely new categories like drones, utilizing enabling technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and others. And we participate at Skyworks in all of these markets through our suite of connectivity solutions. 
And lastly, we've successfully redefined our business model, combining a strategic focus on higher value-added integrated solutions, with unrivaled scale, with advanced manufacturing capabilities and deep operational knowhow. 
The end result is that we are consistently delivering among the best financial returns in the semiconductor sector in a variety of market conditions. As just one measure of this, our return on invested capital for 2015 was 33%. And over the last 2 years, we've averaged 30%.
So in closing, looking past the near-term volatility, we've created a unique and a robust business model, fueled by the proliferation of connectivity and combining above-market top-line growth, healthy cash flow and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions, please."

But I don't think it has any material impact on supply at all. And in fact, it's been on our roadmap, particularly when you look at DRx technology, which is a lot of filters, a lot of passives. It's always been on our roadmap for margins -- frankly, for margin as well as performance to pull that technology more and more in-house. So we can pull it in if we have to. And it really will be -- will play out over time. But I wouldn't worry about it from a supply constraint."

You're -- just get a glimpse of your capacity in Panasonic. They used to build their own SAW. Then you guys converted them over to TC, but it sounds like you could go back fairly easy if you had the capacity. And then Qualcomm has been making a lot of this JV, but can you just refresh our memory before the JV was announced. Were you seeing Qualcomm in any of the competitions for any of the RF in any of the major players? I know they've been doing RF360 for like 3 years now. And so I just want to get kind of a snapshot before we lose our minds on the JV on what was going on with Qualcomm in RF before then. And then, Don, the 60% incremental gross margins, what's the primary driver that you're going to need to get there? What's driving that? And the 53% target margin, the primary driver there, is it a higher mix of integrated products? Or is it just throughput? And then if you could maybe give us an update on the gas capacity? And most importantly your packaging assembly test capacity in Mexico?"

The TDK and Qualcomm have been working closely together and fielding designs for a long time. We've competed very successfully against those designs, so there hasn't been a lot of traction in the sweet spot of what we do. There've been other RF360 components of that system, in which we don't compete, where they've had success. But these decades of gallium arsenide performance and driving switch technologies and multi-chip module technology and getting to put our own high-performance filters has really given us a system-level performance that has not been easy for competition to replicate. We know TDK very well. We've used them in the past. They're mostly SAW. They've got some limited capability involved. But remember, I think, as your question alluded to, our customers are awarding business based purely on performance and on configurability. And what it does at the system level. And we have a clear advantage at the system level over anybody. And we've not seen the combination of Qualcomm, TDK to be any meaningful threat over the last 3 years."

One of the things is the overall suite of new products we release, because there's more integration, more value for the customer. We're just seeing better margins on that. So that's -- you could -- that's a mix, but it's not mix that's real -- it's more value-added integrated solutions. And that's really helping. And it's the things we do on CapEx. It's the things we do on driving productivity improvements through the fab, through the assembly and test operation in Mexicali. We've driven filter costs down dramatically. So we're executing as we have for a long time pretty well across all fronts. And they're all contributing to the margin story. As far as capacity, we're in really good shape. We've got square footage on a new lease facility in Mexicali. So it's short money for equipment. We can expand that very, very quickly. That pays back quickly. Dave already talked about quadrupling the filter capacity as far as square footage in Japan. So with equipment, again, we can do that very quickly.

So I think that the merchant GaAs market, merchant GaAs capability pales in comparison to the stellar device performance that companies like Skyworks and we specifically are getting. So I'm not too worried about any new GaAs entrant. And I'm definitely not worried about CMOS technology being able to accomplish the kind of current consumption, the kind of transmit requirements that we're seeing across our markets today.

We look at the filter technology you wanted to deploy. And all that comes together. And it's worked out great. And the TC capabilities that we have today are unbelievable. They're world-class. We'll manufacture -- in this last calendar year, we manufactured about 1.5 billion TC SAWs, all of which were consumed by our integrated system. So we're very bullish on that concept. And we'll continue to use the best technologies to win."

We delivered another solid financial performance for the second fiscal quarter of 2016, posting year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and earnings even as we navigated to a combination of inventory adjustments and a forecast reductions at one of our major customers.
During the quarter, we delivered revenue of $775 million, that's in line with our guidance, and posted gross margin of 50.8%, that's up 410 basis points year-over-year. We generated operating income of $285 million, that's up 10% year-over-year. We produced operating margin of 36.8%, and we provided $1.25 in earnings per share, that's up 9% versus the prior year.
For the first half of fiscal 2016, we generated roughly $383 million in free cash flow, redistributing over 60% or $234 million to shareholders through our dividend plan and our share repurchase activity.
Q2 was a solid quarter, highlighting the strong execution of our team and the robustness of our financial model. Our gross margin initiatives and operating expense discipline enabled us to both expand margins and earnings in the seasonally down quarter.
The market environment remains challenging entering the third fiscal quarter. The June quarter is normally a transitional period in our sector, bridging the March quarter's seasonal trough with the stronger second half of the calendar year. This year, inventory drawdowns and slower sell-through trends of our top customer are providing a drag on overall demand levels, impacting our Q3 guidance despite our strong growth in growing markets and with other OEMs.
As we navigate through these customer-specific dynamics, our competitive position and our financial model remained quite strong. We continue to improve our gross margins and our overall financial returns while investing aggressively in innovation and in capacity. It's also worth emphasizing a couple of important points. First, among our top customers, we see complexity and increasing performance requirements driving content expansion across the board. As an example, our overall content on Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 platform is up 20% versus prior year models. We've also secured more than $9 of content within Huawei's new flagship smartphone platforms, helping to drive over 40% year-over-year growth with this customer.
Secondly, we continue to be highly successful in leading the market transition towards integrated solutions and we're consolidating share while expanding our technology leadership.
And third, we continue to see significant traction with the Internet of Things as evidenced by our 18% year-over-year growth in our broad markets product segment. These factors give us a high confidence in our longer-term gross prospects. And before providing more specifics on the market environment, turn the call over to Don for more in-depth review of our financial results."

Revenue for the second quarter was $775.1 million, and that's in line with our guidance and up 1.7% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $393.6 million or 50.8% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 410 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating expenses were $108.6 million, consisting of R&D expense of $73.1 million and SG&A expense of $35.5 million.
We generated $285 million of operating income, up 10% of the year-ago quarter and that translates into a 36.8% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 14.3%, resulting in net income of $242.3 million or $1.25 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.01 ahead of our guidance and represents around a 9% year-over-year earnings growth.
Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We invested $37 million in capital expenditures and with depreciation of $53.6 million, we generated $154.5 million in cash flow from operations and we exited the quarter with roughly $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt. We also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock during the quarter at an average price of just over $67.50 a share. Given our confidence in our long-term business trends, we expect to continue to be very active with our share repurchase activity at current levels.
Moving to product mix. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 17% of revenue; integrated mobile systems was 58%; and broad markets was 25%. We saw healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems and broad markets. We're quite pleased that our broad markets portfolio grew over 18% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to expect IMS to remain our strongest growth segment followed by broad markets, while power amplifier products continue to decline as a percentage of our revenue as the market shifts toward higher value integrated solutions.
Now for our third quarter business outlook. We expect third quarter revenue to be approximately $750 million, with softness at our largest customer being partially offset by strong year-over-year growth at Samsung in China and across the broad markets. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51% with operating expenses flat to Q2 at approximately $108.5 million.
It is worth noting that our Q3 gross margin guidance implies a 200 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook in the face of current market conditions highlight the benefits of our higher value integrated systems, along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations.
Looking ahead, we see opportunity for additional margin improvement as we continue to ramp our custom solutions and leverage our recent capital investments. As a guideline, we recommend modeling a 60% incremental gross margin off of the third quarter baseline. We continue to target a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress towards achieving this goal.
And below the line, we anticipate around $1 billion in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate between 14.5% to 15%. We project our tax rate to remain in this range for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year. And we expect share count to be around 192.5 million shares, which results in a third quarter EPS of $1.21.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

While I'm very pleased by the resilience of our financial model in spite of the well-publicized market challenges to our near-term top line growth.

While I'm very pleased by the resilience of our financial model in spite of the well-publicized market challenges to our near-term top line growth. And even more importantly, I'm highly confident that the underlying technology themes fielding our long-term growth remain quite positive. And we're fortunate to be leveraged to powerful security technology trends and we've spent of the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these. And with that in mind, I want to take just a moment to reiterate a couple of the more significant drivers that we see fueling our growth in the coming years.
First is the Internet of Things. This opportunity is measured in the tens of billions of units and projected to grow at an 83% CAGR through 2020. And our success here has been borne out by a broad and a growing list of wins in new markets like automotive, medical, industrial, wearables and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals to our suite of connectivity solutions, which now includes support for low-power, for wide area networking, for Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and GPS standards. Our design win pipeline provides a number of tangible examples of our success in this market. In fact, in this quarter alone, we landed new opportunities which include vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems with Cadillac's 2017 platform; GPS-based industrial tracking devices for Iotera; a new connected home hub designed -- for a leading online realtor -- retailer; Cat-M solutions for machine-to-machine applications in a variety of end markets; connectivity modules and set-top boxes for Ares; temperature control systems for multiple smart home solutions; analog ICs supporting new Smartwatch platforms; and 16 Skyworks devices in Cisco's latest large enterprise access point systems.
The second major growth theme for us is the skyrocketing demand for data -- wireless data, which is being fueled by a growing number of applications like streaming media, like mobile advertising, virtual reality and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. These services are all in -- and they consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth drastically increasing demands on networks and on devices. As sophisticated as today's devices are, they're simply not good enough to support the immense data requirements of these types of new applications which will be rolling out over the next few years. To address this performance gap, OEMs today are incrementing techniques like carrier aggregation, received diversity, MIMO and ultimately 5G, which require dramatically higher levels of analog performance at the semiconductor level.
As a technology enabler to these system upgrades, our addressable content per device is rising, driving TAM growth well in excess of the broader semiconductor space. Both of these secular growth teams are playing out for us in real time. And we're capitalizing by combining a strategic focus on higher value-added integrated solutions with unrivaled scale, advanced manufacturing capabilities and a deep system-level know-how. This is the key reason that we are consistently delivering among the best financial returns in the semiconductor sector in a variety of market conditions.
In closing, looking past the near-term volatility, we have created a unique and a robust business model, fueled by the proliferation of connectivity and combining above-market topline growth, healthy cash flow and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.

Now it's a little bit challenging this year for a couple of reasons and it's with our largest customer, right? Unlike prior years, units will be down year-over-year really for the first time. And they're also absorbing some excess inventory which adds a headwind. So I think as we absorb that issue, outside of this, we expect all other areas of the business to be very strong. We think our revenue will be up over 10% when we exclude this customer. We're seeing strength at Samsung on G7, growth in China.

It was a lot easier to do that in the short term than to worry about taking labor out and making changes, so that will make sense for us. So as far as going forward -- so our fabs and our Mexicali facility were pretty much a utilization. And we don't expect that to change a lot going forward.

Our IoT business, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, is up both sequentially and year-over-year and these are very positive tailwinds. I think '16 is a little bit of a unique year because you're going to see some high-level smartphone softness given the global macroeconomic choppiness. And, of course, as we discussed with our top customer, there's overall unit sales decline in the second half of the year, which gives unfavorable comps. And of course, there aggressively ramping down the legacy model so it creates an inventory burn.

First, the details are that when we look at the carrier aggregation requirements for the advanced switching, with the tuning, with the module capabilities that you require different band aggregation and combination that are quite challenging to our customers, there's a lot of content expansion. And so what we've been doing is we're leveraging a lot of in-house filter expertise. You ask specific about filters and intellectual property. We've been making investments in foundry partnerships to support bulk acoustic technologies, plus we have our own increasingly high piquancy temperature compensated SAW. So we'll continue -- you'll continue to see wins at the higher frequencies. And the SkyBlue system architecture allows for more content because we are able to control all the system parameters in a way that they get the current consumption and they're able to do with and we're tuning it quite -- in a quite sophisticate of a between the end amplifiers and switches, the filters and obviously the antenna on the transmit side. But if you take a step back, our customers truly don't care what the process technology is in those filters. What they want is current, they need size, they need them to market, obviously they need overall component performance. So I think over time the question of what filter technology is chosen, which band will be less relevant and what will be relevant to will be being able to have a system architecture that provides the kind of current that they need to have the functionality that their customers demand."

The open market of the white box China which not only serves the domestic market but also is a catalyst for serving emerging markets. So China, for example, in Q2 we're up by 14% sequentially. We think year-over-year when we finished FY '16, China will be up about 20% to 25%. So we have great traction with OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi and a number of other white box players. But really today what we're seeing is nice content gains and real material gains from Huawei, we talked about earlier, but that's a customer that's adopted high, mid, low band solutions, with 5 solutions, Wi-Fi, as well as some of our power solutions. So we really pleased with that. That's a customer that's our clear #3 now for Skyworks. We expect solid growth there for next year. And also continuing to do the work with MediaTek and others to make sure we pick up the white box players."

Well, we delivered another solid financial performance for the second fiscal quarter of 2016, posting year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and earnings, even as we navigated through a combination of inventory adjustments and forecast reductions at one of our major customers.
During the quarter, we delivered revenue of $775 million, that's in line with our guidance. And posted gross margin of 50.8%, that's up 410 basis points year-over-year. We generated operating income of $285 million, that's up 10% year-over-year. We produced operating margin of 36.8%. And we provided $1.25 in earnings per share, that's up 9% versus the prior year.
For the first half of fiscal 2016, we generated roughly $383 million in free cash flow, redistributing over 60% or $234 million to shareholders through our dividend plan and our share repurchase activity.
Q2 was a solid quarter, highlighting the strong execution of our team and the robustness of our financial model. Our gross margin initiatives and operating expense discipline enabled us to both expand margins and earnings in the seasonally down quarter.
The market environment remains challenging entering the third fiscal quarter. The June quarter is normally a transitional period in our sector, bridging the March quarter's seasonal trough with the stronger second half of the calendar year. This year, inventory drawdowns and slower sell-through trends at our top customer are providing a drag on overall demand levels, impacting our Q3 guidance despite our strong growth in broad markets and with other OEMs.
As we navigate through this customer's -- through these customer-specific dynamics, our competitive position and our financial model remained quite strong. We continue to improve our gross margins and our overall financial returns while investing aggressively in innovation and in capacity. It's also worth emphasizing a couple of important points. First, among our top customers, we see complexity and increasing performance requirements driving content expansion across the board. As an example, our overall content on Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 platform is up 20% versus prior models. We've also secured more than $9 of content within Huawei's new flagship smartphone platforms, helping to drive over 40% year-over-year growth with this customer.
Secondly, we continue to be highly successful in leading the market transition toward integrated solutions, and we're consolidating share while extending our technology leadership.
And third, we continue to see significant traction with the Internet of Things, as evidenced by our 18% year-over-year growth in our broad markets product segment. These factors give us a high confidence in our longer-term growth prospects. 
And before providing more specifics on the market environment, I'll turn the call over to Don for more in-depth review of our financial results."

Revenue for the second quarter was $775.1 million, and that's in line with our guidance and up 1.7% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $393.6 million or 50.8% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 410 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating expenses were $108.6 million, consisting of R&D expense of $73.1 million and SG&A expense of $35.5 million.
We generated $285 million of operating income, up 10% from the year-ago quarter, and that translates into a 36.8% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 14.3%, resulting in net income of $242.3 million or $1.25 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.01 ahead of our guidance and represents around a 9% year-over-year earnings growth.
Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We invested $37 million in capital expenditures. And with depreciation of $53.6 million, we generated $154.5 million in cash flow from operations. And we exited the quarter with roughly $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt. We also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock during the quarter at an average price of just over $67.50 a share. Given our confidence in our long-term business trends, we expect to continue to be very active with our share repurchase activity at current levels.
Moving to product mix. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 17% of revenue; integrated mobile systems was 58%; and broad markets was 25%. We saw healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems and broad markets. We're quite pleased that our broad markets portfolio grew over 18% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to expect IMS to remain our strongest growth segment, followed by broad markets, while power amplifier products continue to decline as a percentage of our revenue as the market shifts toward higher-value integrated solutions.
Now for our third quarter business outlook. We expect third quarter revenue to be approximately $750 million, with softness at our largest customer being partially offset by strong year-over-year growth at Samsung in China and across the broad markets. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%, with operating expenses flat to Q2 at approximately $108.5 million.
It is worth noting that our Q3 gross margin guidance implies a 200 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook in the face of current market conditions highlight the benefits of our higher-value integrated systems, along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations.
Looking ahead, we see opportunity for additional margin improvement as we continue to ramp our custom solutions and leverage our recent capital investments. As a guideline, we recommend modeling a 60% incremental gross margin off of the third quarter baseline. We continue to target a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress towards achieving this goal.
And below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate between 14.5% to 15%. We project our tax rate to remain in this range for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year. And we expect share count to be around 192.5 million shares, which results in a third quarter EPS of $1.21.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Well, I'm very pleased by the resilience of our financial model in spite of the well-publicized market challenges to our near-term top line growth. And even more importantly, I'm highly confident that the underlying technology themes fueling our long-term growth remain quite positive. And we're fortunate to be levered to powerful secular technology trends, and we've spent of the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these. And with that in mind, I want to take just a moment to reiterate a couple of the more significant drivers that we see fueling our growth in the coming years.
First is the Internet of Things. This opportunity is measured in the tens of billions of units and projected to grow at an 83% CAGR through 2020. And our success here has been borne out by a broad and a growing list of wins in new markets, like automotive, medical, industrial, wearables and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of connectivity solutions, which now includes support for low-power, for wide area networking, for Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and GPS standards. 
Our design win pipeline provides a number of tangible examples of our success in this market. In fact, in this quarter alone, we landed new opportunities, which include: Vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems with Cadillac's 2017 platform; GPS-based industrial tracking devices for Iotera; a new connected home hub designed -- for a leading online realtor -- retailer; Cat-M solutions for machine-to-machine applications in a variety of end markets; connectivity modules and set-top boxes for Arris; temperature control systems for multiple smart home solutions; analog ICs supporting new Smartwatch platforms; and 16 Skyworks devices in Cisco's latest large enterprise access point systems.
The second major growth theme for us is the skyrocketing demand for data -- wireless data, which is being fueled by a growing number of new applications, like streaming media, like mobile advertising, virtual reality and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. These services are all in their infancy, and they consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth, drastically increasing demands on networks and on devices. As sophisticated as today's devices are, they're simply not good enough to support the immense data requirements of these types of new applications which will be rolling out over the next few years. To address this performance gap, OEMs today are implementing techniques like carrier aggregation, receive diversity, MIMO and ultimately 5G, which require dramatically higher levels of analog performance at the semiconductor level. As a technology enabler to these system upgrades, our addressable content per device is rising, driving TAM growth well in excess of the broader semiconductor space. 
Both of these secular growth teams are playing out for us in real time, and we're capitalizing by combining a strategic focus on higher-value-added integrated solutions with unrivaled scale, advanced manufacturing capabilities and a deep system-level know-how. This is the key reason that we are consistently delivering among the best financial returns in the semiconductor sector in a variety of market conditions.
In closing, looking past the near-term volatility, we've created a unique and a robust business model, fueled by the proliferation of connectivity and combining above-market topline growth, healthy cash flow and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line, please."

Now it's a little bit challenging this year for a couple of reasons, and it's with our largest customer, right? Unlike prior years, units will be down year-over-year, really, for the first time. And they're also absorbing some excess inventory, which adds a headwind. So I think as we absorb that issue, outside of this, we expect all other areas of the business to be very strong. We think our revenue will be up over 10% when we exclude this customer. We're seeing strength at Samsung on G7, growth in China. Our broad markets business will be up 15% to 20% on a year-over-year basis. So we're obviously not immune, though, to significant reductions from this customer, but I think we'll fare better than most, and we'll continue to focus on returns to the business."

It was a lot easier to do that in the short term than to worry about taking labor out and making changes, so that all make sense for us. So as far as going forward -- so our fabs in our Mexicali facility were pretty much a utilization. And we don't expect that to change a lot going forward.

We're pulling more functionality into our integrated mobile systems, we're expanding our footprint with more functionality. And in fact, we're continuing to see fewer competitors who are able to consolidate share. Our IoT business, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, is up both sequentially and year-over-year, and these are very positive tailwinds. I think '16 is a little bit of a unique year because I think you're going to see some high-level smartphone softness, given global macroeconomic choppiness. And of course, as we discussed with our top customer, there's overall unit sales decline in the second half of the year, which gives some unfavorable comps. And of course, they're aggressively ramping down the legacy model, so it creates an inventory burn. So I think 2016, we have to look at as a unique phenomenon.

Recognize that we outsourced some wafer supply, we outsource some assembly and test. So we're able to modulate that. But as far as running our internal operations, we're going to keep that utilization pretty relatively high. So that will, in fact, allow us to continue the margin story. And we're not going to be building inventory levels that really are far ahead of demand. We'll flush through what we've seen at the end of this quarter, and we would expect that to get to a more normalized rate as we move forward. As far as the margin expansion in the back half of the year, it's been a consistent story. And you see it in our margin gains quarter-over-quarter that as we release new products, we're seeing better margins on those products, that whether it be in emerging markets like China, whether it be like large OEMs. So there's nothing in that story that's going to continue to slow down.

And we're incorporating things, like temperature compensated SAW, regular SAW, bulk acoustic devices. And it's an architecture that our customers see simply as being elegantly easy for them to use in the sense that it's very highly indicated. It tunes up at the antenna and saves some point of current and size. And we will -- absolutely, we'll see that the customers' architectural approaches that will be customized for different markets, that you'll see continue to contribute to our gross margin.

As far as handicapping when it happens, right now, we're in a little bit of a tough backdrop that we're working through. So as you model growth opportunities off of, let's say, the September quarter or the December, pick a quarter, you apply whatever annual growth rate you want to that, the 60% drop.

Atif, I'm glad you asked that question. Because I'm going to take maybe a 2-prong approach to it. First, the details are that when we look at the carrier aggregation requirements, with the advanced switching, with the tuning, with the module capabilities that you require different band aggregation and combinations of that, that are quite challenging to our customers, there's a lot of content expansion. And so what we've been doing is we're leveraging a lot of in-house filter expertise. You asked specifically about filters and intellectual property. We've been making investments in foundry partnerships to support bulk acoustic technologies. Of course, we have our own increasingly relevant and high -- mid- and high-frequency temperature-compensated SAW. So we'll continue to -- you'll continue to see wins at the higher frequencies. And the SkyBlue system architecture allows for more content because we're able to control all the system parameters in a way that they get the current consumption, and they're able to do it, and we're tuning it quite -- in a quite sophisticate way between the amplifiers, the switches, the filters and obviously the antenna on the transmit side. But if you take a step back, our customers truly don't care what the process technology is in those filters. What they want is current, they need size, they need time to market, obviously, they need overall performance. And so I think over time, the question of what filter technology is chosen for which band will be less relevant. And what will be relevant will be being able to have a system architecture that provides the kind of current that they need to add the functionality that their customers demand."

I know you were very big in Phase 2 of MediaTek, but it sounds like things moved more to the 5 mode. And I know there was -- there's a little bit of a share give-back there. So I'm just interested in how much of an offset China was, specifically in the white box area, where you're dealing with these reference designs. And then Don, you're sitting on a record high inventory, for your largest customer's winding down the flagship model. With the big declines in demand that, that model's going to go through here. What gives you confidence you can work through that inventory? The parts, I would assume, are not interchangeable with the new model coming up in the fall.

Well, we delivered another solid financial performance for the second fiscal quarter of 2016, posting year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and earnings, even as we navigated through a combination of inventory adjustments and forecast reductions at one of our major customers.
During the quarter, we delivered revenue of $775 million, that's in line with our guidance. And posted gross margin of 50.8%, that's up 410 basis points year-over-year. We generated operating income of $285 million, that's up 10% year-over-year. We produced operating margin of 36.8%. And we provided $1.25 in earnings per share, that's up 9% versus the prior year.
For the first half of fiscal 2016, we generated roughly $383 million in free cash flow, redistributing over 60% or $234 million to shareholders through our dividend plan and our share repurchase activity.
Q2 was a solid quarter, highlighting the strong execution of our team and the robustness of our financial model. Our gross margin initiatives and operating expense discipline enabled us to both expand margins and earnings in the seasonally down quarter.
The market environment remains challenging entering the third fiscal quarter. The June quarter is normally a transitional period in our sector, bridging the March quarter's seasonal trough with the stronger second half of the calendar year. This year, inventory drawdowns and slower sell-through trends at our top customer are providing a drag on overall demand levels, impacting our Q3 guidance despite our strong growth in broad markets and with other OEMs.
As we navigate through this customer's -- through these customer-specific dynamics, our competitive position and our financial model remained quite strong. We continue to improve our gross margins and our overall financial returns while investing aggressively in innovation and in capacity. It's also worth emphasizing a couple of important points. First, among our top customers, we see complexity and increasing performance requirements driving content expansion across the board. As an example, our overall content on Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 platform is up 20% versus prior models. We've also secured more than $9 of content within Huawei's new flagship smartphone platforms, helping to drive over 40% year-over-year growth with this customer.
Secondly, we continue to be highly successful in leading the market transition toward integrated solutions, and we're consolidating share while extending our technology leadership.
And third, we continue to see significant traction with the Internet of Things, as evidenced by our 18% year-over-year growth in our broad markets product segment. These factors give us a high confidence in our longer-term growth prospects. 
And before providing more specifics on the market environment, I'll turn the call over to Don for a more in-depth review of our financial results."

Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We invested $37 million in capital expenditures. And with depreciation of $53.6 million, we generated $154.5 million in cash flow from operations. And we exited the quarter with roughly $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt. We also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock during the quarter at an average price of just over $67.50 a share. Given our confidence in our long-term business trends, we expect to continue to be very active with our share repurchase activity at current levels.
Moving to product mix. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 17% of revenue; integrated mobile systems was 58%; and broad markets was 25%. We saw healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems and broad markets. We're quite pleased that our broad markets portfolio grew over 18% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to expect IMS to remain our strongest growth segment, followed by broad markets, while power amplifier products continue to decline as a percentage of our revenue as the market shifts toward higher-value integrated solutions.
Now for our third quarter business outlook. We expect third quarter revenue to be approximately $750 million, with softness at our largest customer being partially offset by strong year-over-year growth at Samsung, in China and across the broad markets. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%, with operating expenses flat to Q2 at approximately $108.5 million.
It is worth noting that our Q3 gross margin guidance implies a 200 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook in the face of current market conditions highlights the benefits of our higher-value integrated systems, along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations.
Looking ahead, we see opportunity for additional margin improvement as we continue to ramp our custom solutions and leverage our recent capital investments. As a guideline, we recommend modeling a 60% incremental gross margin off of the third quarter baseline. We continue to target a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress towards achieving this goal.
And below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate between 14.5% to 15%. We project our tax rate to remain in this range for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year. And we expect share count to be around 192.5 million shares, which results in a third quarter EPS of $1.21.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Well, I'm very pleased by the resilience of our financial model in spite of the well-publicized market challenges to our near-term top line growth. And even more importantly, I'm highly confident that the underlying technology themes fueling our long-term growth remain quite positive. And we're fortunate to be levered to powerful secular technology trends, and we've spent of the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these. And with that in mind, I want to take just a moment to reiterate a couple of the more significant drivers that we see fueling our growth in the coming years.
First is the Internet of Things. This opportunity is measured in the tens of billions of units and projected to grow at an 83% CAGR through 2020. And our success here has been borne out by a broad and a growing list of wins in new markets, like automotive, medical, industrial, wearables and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of connectivity solutions, which now includes support for low-power, for wide area networking, for Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and GPS standards. 
Our design win pipeline provides a number of tangible examples of our success in this market. In fact, in this quarter alone, we landed new opportunities, which include: Vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems with Cadillac's 2017 platform; GPS-based industrial tracking devices for Iotera; a new connected home hub designed -- for a leading online realtor -- retailer; Cat-M solutions for machine-to-machine applications in a variety of end markets; connectivity modules and set-top boxes for Arris; temperature control systems for multiple smart home solutions; analog ICs supporting new Smartwatch platforms; and 16 Skyworks devices in Cisco's latest large enterprise access point systems.
The second major growth theme for us is the skyrocketing demand for data -- wireless data, which is being fueled by a growing number of new applications, like streaming media, like mobile advertising, virtual reality and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. These services are all in their infancy, and they consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth, drastically increasing demands on networks and on devices. As sophisticated as today's devices are, they're simply not good enough to support the immense data requirements of these types of new applications which will be rolling out over the next few years. To address this performance gap, OEMs today are implementing techniques like carrier aggregation, receive diversity, MIMO and ultimately 5G, which require dramatically higher levels of analog performance at the semiconductor level. As a technology enabler to these system upgrades, our addressable content per device is rising, driving TAM growth well in excess of the broader semiconductor space. 
Both of these secular growth themes are playing out for us in real time, and we're capitalizing by combining a strategic focus on higher-value-added integrated solutions with unrivaled scale, advanced manufacturing capabilities and a deep system-level know-how. This is the key reason that we are consistently delivering among the best financial returns in the semiconductor sector in a variety of market conditions.
In closing, looking past the near-term volatility, we've created a unique and a robust business model, fueled by the proliferation of connectivity and combining above-market topline growth, healthy cash flow and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line, please."

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think June is normally a seasonal and a transitional period for us. Now it's a little bit challenging this year for a couple of reasons, and it's with our largest customer, right? Unlike prior years, units will be down year-over-year, really, for the first time. And they're also absorbing some excess inventory, which adds a headwind. So I think as we absorb that issue, outside of this, we expect all other areas of the business to be very strong. We think our revenue will be up over 10% when we exclude this customer. We're seeing strength at Samsung on G7, growth in China. Our broad markets business will be up 15% to 20% on a year-over-year basis. So we're obviously not immune, though, to significant reductions from this customer, but I think we'll fare better than most, and we'll continue to focus on returns to the business."

It was a lot easier to do that in the short term than to worry about taking labor out and making changes, so that all made sense for us. So as far as going forward -- so our fabs in our Mexicali facility were pretty much at utilization. And we don't expect that to change a lot going forward. So the margin improvement you're seeing is just the normal improvement that we would build off of the product mix that we're shipping. So I wouldn't expect a big change because of that."

On the positive side, answering the growth question, we continue to see our content go up with each and every new generation. This year is no different. No different. We're pulling more functionality into our integrated mobile systems, we're expanding our footprint with more functionality. And in fact, we're continuing to see fewer competitors who are able to consolidate share. Our IoT business, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, is up both sequentially and year-over-year, and these are very positive tailwinds. I think '16 is a little bit of a unique year because I think you're going to see some high-level smartphone softness, given global macroeconomic choppiness. And of course, as we discussed with our top customer, there's overall unit sales decline in the second half of the year, which gives some unfavorable comps. And of course, they're aggressively ramping down the legacy model, so it creates an inventory burn. So I think 2016, we have to look at as a unique phenomenon. And I suspect as you go through the second half of 2016, it will be much more positive, we'll start to see some strong sequential growth. In '17, I do absolutely see growth in the overall RF and analog TAM, being double digits year-over-year."

And you see that, for instance, on the margin line, what we just guided at 51%. So we're up sequentially in margin even though we are down some in revenue. So the assumptions underlying the new target model are very, very solid with gross margin, our ability to manage OpEx, we know how to do all those things. As far as handicapping when it happens, right now, we're in a little bit of a tough backdrop that we're working through. So as you model growth opportunities off of, let's say, the September quarter or the December, pick a quarter, you apply whatever annual growth rate you want to that, the 60% drop. So you'll see that the model is still in place and that'll get you there in a reasonable time frame. But you have to model that and make your own assumptions to get to that time frame."

Atif, I'm glad you asked that question. Because I'm going to take maybe a 2-prong approach to it. First, the details are that when we look at the carrier aggregation requirements, with the advanced switching, with the tuning, with the module capabilities that you require different band aggregation and combinations of that, that are quite challenging to our customers, there's a lot of content expansion. And so what we've been doing is we're leveraging a lot of in-house filter expertise. You asked specifically about filters and intellectual property. We've been making investments in foundry partnerships to support bulk acoustic technologies. Of course, we have our own increasingly relevant and high -- mid- and high-frequency temperature-compensated SAW. So we'll continue to -- you'll continue to see wins at the higher frequencies. And the SkyBlue system architecture allows for more content because we're able to control all the system parameters in a way that they get the current consumption, and they're able to do it, and we're tuning it quite -- in this quite sophisticated way between the amplifiers, the switches, the filters and obviously the antenna on the transmit side. But if you take a step back, our customers truly don't care what the process technology is in those filters. What they want is current, they need size, they need time to market, obviously, they need overall performance. And so I think over time, the question of what filter technology is chosen for which band will be less relevant. And what will be relevant will be being able to have a system architecture that provides the kind of current that they need to add the functionality that their customers demand."

I know you were very big in Phase 2 at MediaTek, but it sounds like things moved more to the 5 mode. And I know there was -- there's a little bit of a share give-back there. So I'd be interested in how much of an offset China was, specifically in the white box area, where you're dealing with these reference designs. And then Don, you're sitting on a record high inventory, while your largest customer's winding down the flagship model. With the big declines in demand that, that model's going to go through here, what gives you confidence you can work through that inventory? The parts, I would assume, are not interchangeable with the new model coming up in the fall. So I'm a little confused here because you talked about running the fabs near -- and your fab facility relatively high utilization rates, but then also burning off inventory.

So we have great traction with OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi and a number of other white box players. But really today, what we were seeing is nice, nice content gains and real material revenue gains from Huawei.

Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution on the part of the Skyworks team. We exceeded our guidance, returned over $240 million in cash to our shareholders and importantly, continued to broaden our design win pipeline, setting the stage for sustained market outperformance. 
Looking at the results in more detail, we delivered revenue of $752 million ahead of our guidance; expanded gross margins to 50.9%, up 190 basis points year-over-year; produced operating income of $275 million, with operating margins over 36%. Finally, we generated $1.24 in earnings per share, $0.03 above consensus.  Execution on revenue and margins, along with operating cost discipline, were all key elements of this performance. 
In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to gain broad market traction. Specifically during the quarter, we powered Huawei's P9 phone, incorporating 10 unique devices including our SkyOne systems across low, mid-and high bands; launched advanced carrier aggregation capabilities across a suite of premium and value tier accounts including Samsung, Motorola as well as Oppo, Vivo and ZTE. We secured design wins for Continental's 4G LTE automotive systems, captured a digital attenuator and multimode repeater designs at Audi, and enabled enterprise radio for Google's 3.5 gigahertz band ecosystem. 
We also achieved several other milestones, including surpassing production of 2 billion filters cumulatively from our joint venture with Panasonic; ramping SkyBlue innovative technology for enhanced power management in LED flash drivers; commencing volume production of proprietary diversity received solutions; and supporting the world's first headcam with LTE connectivity in 4k video streaming.
These major wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the Internet of Things.

Revenue for the third quarter was $751.7 million, and that's ahead of our guidance. Gross profit was $382.3 million or 50.9% of revenue, and that's in line with our guidance and up 190 basis points from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.6 million. That consists of R&D expense of $70.2 million and SG&A expense of $37.4 million. We generated $274.7 million of operating income, translating into a 36.5% operating margin. 
Our cash tax rate was 12.7%, resulting in net income of $238.1 million or $1.24 diluted earnings per share, $0.03 ahead of our guidance. Our cash tax rate is now projected lower for fiscal 2016 at 14%. The Q3 rate was favorably impacted by a year-to-date adjustment from the prior 14% -- 14.7% annual rate. 
Turning to a summary of our third fiscal quarter cash flow metrics, we invested $57 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $54.6 million, generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. We returned over $240 million to shareholders via dividends and the repurchase of 3 million shares during the quarter. 
Looking at product mix for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, integrated mobile systems was 55% of revenue, broad markets was 29% and power amplifiers was 16%. 
Now moving on to our fourth fiscal quarter business outlook.  Based on the broad market traction, our new program ramps as well as the content gains Liam has outlined, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10% to 11% sequentially to $831 million at the midpoint. The  double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4 followed by continued growth into our first fiscal quarter will reduce inventory. We have level loaded our factories and positioned ourselves well to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps with leading customers.
For fiscal Q4, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%. it's worth noting that our Q4 gross margin guidance implies 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter even with a lower revenue base. 
Looking at OpEx, we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat with Q3, reflecting continued cost structure discipline. 
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, a cash tax rate of 14%. 
We expect share count to be roughly 190 million shares, driving fourth fiscal quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.43. 
Lastly, we also announced today that our board has authorized an 8% dividend increase and a new 400 million stock repurchase program, underscoring the confidence as we have in our business model and ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Our third quarter execution highlights our differentiated competitive positioning and the strength of our business model. We are levered to [ph] powerful secular technology forces and have spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these strategic macro trends, propelling our mobile IoT and broad market opportunity.
First is the explosive growth of mobile data across the vast set of applications and usage cases, driving performance from device to cloud and beyond. Next, we are seeing an ever-increasing expansion of connectivity, with tens of billions of connected devices brought to market over the next 5 years. And finally, we address a tremendous ecosystem and new economy that thrives on the ability to leverage high-speed and secure connectivity at the heart of their business. 
Enabling these connections is the sweet spot of our franchise. In mobile, we have growing content positions across all of the world's premier OEMs, leveraging our unique capabilities to meet our customers' increasing need for higher-performance solutions. We are also building momentum in broad markets, particularly in IoT, with engagements at leading players including Amazon, Arris, Cisco, Fitbit, GE, Google Nest, Honeywell, Itron, LG and others.
Our success here has been brought about by a broad and growing list of wins in adjacent markets like industrial, energy management, security, health and fitness and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of diverse technologies, including support for WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, GPS, small cell and LTE standards. At the same time, we are building presence in key verticals like automotive with leaders such as Continental, Audi, Ford, Kia, GM and Volkswagen.
Underpinning all of our solutions is the skyrocketing demand for wireless data. Whether it's Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google or Tesla, there is a powerful and expanding ecosystem, monetizing and relying upon efficient, high speed, low latency, seamless and secure connections.  This ecosystem spans across enterprise to e-commerce to social media and a burgeoning set of entirely new applications, fueled by connectivity. In an effort to facilitate this massive and growing wave of data delivery, creation and movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, received diversity, and ultimately 5G capabilities. This dynamic requires a continuous increase in the levels of analog and mixed signal performance, enhanced power efficiency, high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks' suite of products and systems in solution are squarely aimed at resolving the intense performance demands facing our customers.
So to summarize, we delivered above-guidance results in the quarter, driven by increasing global demand for high-speed connectivity coupled with strong operational execution. And as our guidance reflects, we are planning for sustained market outperformance with operating leverage and strong cash flow generation. Clearly, we remain well positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.

And then also if you could take it more broadly to the trends you're seeing at your Korean and Chinese customers. I think basically, I think investors want to understand, are we past some of the issues we saw on the first half and it's a more normalized growth environment going forward?

So the dynamic around performance and our ability to resolve performance with system-level solution is coming together quite well. And you can see in the Sky, 10% to 11%, pretty solid guide up into Q4. We feel that that's sustainable. We expect -- So early for Q1, but we expect to be cup up again in Q1. so that's a broad statement. If you look at China and Samsung, both of those opportunities, China being more of broad opportunity with some of the flagship names like Huawei doing very, very well. And China will be one of our faster growing areas. Samsung, we've got content gains on the GS7. That's looking good this year. Samsung will be probably a 15%-plus account for us year-over-year. We're lining out for the GS8. So what you can look at here at a high level is this continuous need for performance and Skyworks' ability to address not only our core positions in SkyOne and some of the transmit chain, but also an increasing position in analog and increasing position in the receive side, WiFi and other technologies will allow us to grow our share."

Our TC socket ability is has moved in frequency where it was largely just low band play, maybe 600, 900 meg. We now have technology well over 1 gig, getting close to 2 and 2.5 gig. again back to what I was mentioning before, we don't have an appetite for selling discrete filters. when we sell a filter, it is wrapped within a complete system. So the filter contributes some level of performance. But you also have your HBT, switch, MCM and your ability to minimize losses within your layout. So a lot -- and that -- with Skyworks, all of that I mentioned is controlled in-house. so think about us a system solutions player. Filters play a role in the system, but the entirety of the architecture is what matters. So we've won programs with Huawei. We're close with other customers. There may be a few opportunities where optimal filter performance is the #1 requirement. That may be the case for some of the discrete applications or maybe some super high-performance, high band sockets. Today, perhaps we can't address that.

Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution on the part of the Skyworks team. We exceeded our guidance, returned over $240 million in cash to our shareholders and importantly, continued to broaden our design win pipeline, setting the stage for sustained market outperformance. 
Looking at the results in more detail, we delivered revenue of $752 million ahead of our guidance; expanded gross margins to 50.9%, up 190 basis points year-over-year; produced operating income of $275 million, with operating margins over 36%. Finally, we generated $1.24 in earnings per share, $0.03 above consensus.  Execution on revenue and margins, along with operating cost discipline, were all key elements of this performance. 
In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to gain broad market traction. Specifically during the quarter, we powered Huawei's P9 phone, incorporating 10 unique devices including our SkyOne systems across low, mid-and high bands; launched advanced carrier aggregation capabilities across a suite of premium and value tier accounts including Samsung, Motorola as well as Oppo, Vivo and ZTE. We secured design wins for Continental's 4G LTE automotive systems, captured a digital attenuator and multimode repeater designs at Audi, and enabled enterprise radio for Google's 3.5 gigahertz band ecosystem. 
We also achieved several other milestones, including surpassing production of 2 billion filters cumulatively from our joint venture with Panasonic; ramping SkyBlue innovative technology for enhanced power management in LED flash drivers; commencing volume production of proprietary diversity received solutions; and supporting the world's first headcam with LTE connectivity in 4k video streaming.
These major wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the Internet of Things. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Don for a more in-depth review of our financial results."

Revenue for the third quarter was $751.7 million, and that's ahead of our guidance. Gross profit was $382.3 million or 50.9% of revenue, and that's in line with our guidance and up 190 basis points from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.6 million. That consists of R&D expense of $70.2 million and SG&A expense of $37.4 million. We generated $274.7 million of operating income, translating into a 36.5% operating margin. 
Our cash tax rate was 12.7%, resulting in net income of $238.1 million or $1.24 diluted earnings per share, $0.03 ahead of our guidance. Our cash tax rate is now projected lower for fiscal 2016 at 14%. The Q3 rate was favorably impacted by a year-to-date adjustment from the prior 14% -- 14.7% annual rate. 
Turning to a summary of our third fiscal quarter cash flow metrics, we invested $57 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $54.6 million, generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. We returned over $240 million to shareholders via dividends and the repurchase of 3 million shares during the quarter. 
Looking at product mix for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, integrated mobile systems was 55% of revenue, broad markets was 29% and power amplifiers was 16%. 
Now moving on to our fourth fiscal quarter business outlook.  Based on the broad market traction, our new program ramps as well as the content gains Liam has outlined, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10% to 11% sequentially to $831 million at the midpoint. The  double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4 followed by continued growth into our first fiscal quarter will reduce inventory. We have level loaded our factories and positioned ourselves well to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps with leading customers.
For fiscal Q4, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%. it's worth noting that our Q4 gross margin guidance implies 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter even with a lower revenue base. 
Looking at OpEx, we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat with Q3, reflecting continued cost structure discipline. 
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, a cash tax rate of 14%. 
We expect share count to be roughly 190 million shares, driving fourth fiscal quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.43. 
Lastly, we also announced today that our board has authorized an 8% dividend increase and a new 400 million stock repurchase program, underscoring the confidence as we have in our business model and ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Our third quarter execution highlights our differentiated competitive positioning and the strength of our business model. We are levered to [ph] powerful secular technology forces and have spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these strategic macro trends, propelling our mobile IoT and broad market opportunity.
First is the explosive growth of mobile data across the vast set of applications and usage cases, driving performance from device to cloud and beyond. Next, we are seeing an ever-increasing expansion of connectivity, with tens of billions of connected devices brought to market over the next 5 years. And finally, we address a tremendous ecosystem and new economy that thrives on the ability to leverage high-speed and secure connectivity at the heart of their business. 
Enabling these connections is the sweet spot of our franchise. In mobile, we have growing content positions across all of the world's premier OEMs, leveraging our unique capabilities to meet our customers' increasing need for higher-performance solutions. We are also building momentum in broad markets, particularly in IoT, with engagements at leading players including Amazon, Arris, Cisco, Fitbit, GE, Google Nest, Honeywell, Itron, LG and others.
Our success here has been brought about by a broad and growing list of wins in adjacent markets like industrial, energy management, security, health and fitness and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of diverse technologies, including support for WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, GPS, small cell and LTE standards. At the same time, we are building presence in key verticals like automotive with leaders such as Continental, Audi, Ford, Kia, GM and Volkswagen.
Underpinning all of our solutions is the skyrocketing demand for wireless data. Whether it's Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google or Tesla, there is a powerful and expanding ecosystem, monetizing and relying upon efficient, high speed, low latency, seamless and secure connections.  This ecosystem spans across enterprise to e-commerce to social media and a burgeoning set of entirely new applications, fueled by connectivity. In an effort to facilitate this massive and growing wave of data delivery, creation and movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, received diversity, and ultimately 5G capabilities. This dynamic requires a continuous increase in the levels of analog and mixed signal performance, enhanced power efficiency, high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks' suite of products and systems in solution are squarely aimed at resolving the intense performance demands facing our customers.
So to summarize, we delivered above-guidance results in the quarter, driven by increasing global demand for high-speed connectivity coupled with strong operational execution. And as our guidance reflects, we are planning for sustained market outperformance with operating leverage and strong cash flow generation. Clearly, we remain well positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.

We also had a new hub arrangement for large customer in Asia.

We expect -- So early for Q1, but we expect to be cup up again in Q1. so that's a broad statement. If you look at China and Samsung, both of those opportunities, China being more of broad opportunity with some of the flagship names like Huawei doing very, very well. And China will be one of our faster growing areas. Samsung, we've got content gains on the GS7. That's looking good this year. Samsung will be probably a 15%-plus account for us year-over-year. We're lining out for the GS8.

But yes, competitively, the companies that can hit the performance and the companies that can do that elegantly and unburden our customers with these daunting challenges that they're facing, those are the ones that are going to win and will be at the top of that list. I mean, that's the whole essence of Skyworks, to try to drive a strategy around performance, integrate as much as we can, work with our customers, listen to what they need. It may be different. Every account wants something different, but be flexible enough, leveraging our internal capabilities, leveraging Mexicali [ph] for highly configurable devices, picking the right flavor of filter, but really looking at systems performance from input to output. If we do that well, our business will follow."

Our TC socket ability is has moved in frequency where it was largely just low band play, maybe 600, 900 meg. We now have technology well over 1 gig, getting close to 2 and 2.5 gig. again back to what I was mentioning before, we don't have an appetite for selling discrete filters. when we sell a filter, it is wrapped within a complete system. So the filter contributes some level of performance. But you also have your HBT, switch, MCM and your ability to minimize losses within your layout. So a lot -- and that -- with Skyworks, all of that I mentioned is controlled in-house. so think about us a system solutions player. Filters play a role in the system, but the entirety of the architecture is what matters. So we've won programs with Huawei. We're close with other customers. There may be a few opportunities where optimal filter performance is the #1 requirement. That may be the case for some of the discrete applications or maybe some super high-performance, high band sockets. Today, perhaps we can't address that.

Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution on the part of the Skyworks team. We exceeded our guidance, returned over $240 million in cash to our shareholders and, importantly, continued to broaden our design win pipeline, setting the stage for a sustained market outperformance. 
Looking at the results in more detail, we delivered revenue of $752 million ahead of our guidance; expanded gross margins to 50.9%, up 190 basis points year-over-year; produced operating income of $275 million, with operating margins over 36%. Finally, we generated $1.24 in earnings per share, $0.03 above consensus.  Execution on revenue and margins, along with operating cost discipline, were all key elements of this performance. 
In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to gain broad market traction. Specifically during the quarter, we powered Huawei's P9 phone, incorporating 10 unique devices, including our SkyOne systems, across low, mid- and high bands; launched advanced carrier aggregation capabilities across a suite of premium and value tier accounts, including Samsung, Motorola as well as OPPO, Vivo and ZTE. We secured design wins for Continental's 4G LTE automotive systems, captured digital attenuator and multimode repeater designs at Audi and enabled enterprise radio for Google's 3.5 gigahertz band ecosystem. 
We also achieved several other milestones, including surpassing production of 2 billion filters cumulatively from our joint venture with Panasonic; ramping SkyBlue innovative technology for enhanced power management in LED flash drivers; commencing volume production of proprietary diversity receive solutions; and supporting the world's first head cam with LTE connectivity and 4K video streaming.
These major wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the Internet of Things. 
At this point, I will turn the call over to Don for a more in-depth review of our financial results."

Revenue for the third quarter was $751.7 million, and that's ahead of our guidance. Gross profit was $382.3 million or 50.9% of revenue, and that's in line with our guidance and up 190 basis points from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.6 million. That consists of R&D expense of $70.2 million and SG&A expense of $37.4 million. We generated $274.7 million of operating income, translating into a 36.5% operating margin. 
Our cash tax rate was 12.7%, resulting in net income of $238.1 million or $1.24 diluted earnings per share, $0.03 ahead of our guidance. Our cash tax rate is now projected lower for fiscal 2016 at 14%. The Q3 rate was favorably impacted by a year-to-date adjustment from the prior 14% -- 14.7% annual rate. 
Turning to a summary of our third fiscal quarter cash flow metrics. We invested $57 million in capital expenditures, with depreciation of $54.6 million, generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. We returned over $240 million to shareholders via dividends and the repurchase of 3 million shares during the quarter. 
Looking at product mix for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, integrated mobile systems was 55% of revenue, broad markets was 29% and power amplifiers was 16%. 
Now moving on to our fourth fiscal quarter business outlook.  Based on the broad market traction, our new program ramps as well as the content gains Liam has outlined, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10% to 11% sequentially to $831 million at the midpoint. The double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4, followed by continued growth into our first fiscal quarter, will reduce inventory. We have level-loaded our factories and positioned ourselves well to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps with leading customers.
For fiscal Q4, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%. It's worth noting that our Q4 gross margin guidance implies 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter, even with a lower revenue base. 
Looking at OpEx, we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat with Q3, reflecting continued cost structure discipline. 
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, a cash tax rate of 14%. 
We expect share count to be roughly 190 million shares, driving fourth fiscal quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.43. 
Lastly, we also announced today that our board has authorized an 8% dividend increase and a new 400 million stock repurchase program, underscoring the confidence we have in our business model and our ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Our third quarter execution highlights our differentiated competitive positioning and the strength of our business model. We are levered to powerful secular technology forces, and we have spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these strategic macro trends, propelling our mobile IoT and broad market opportunity.
First is the explosive growth of mobile data across a vast set of applications and usage cases, driving performance from device to cloud and beyond. Next, we are seeing an ever-increasing expansion of connected things, with tens of billions of newly connected devices brought to market over the next 5 years. And finally, we address a tremendous ecosystem and new economy that thrives on the ability to leverage high speed and secure connectivity at the heart of their business. 
Enabling these connections is the sweet spot of our franchise. In mobile, we have growing content positions across all of the world's premier OEMs, leveraging our unique capabilities to meet our customers' increasing need for a higher-performance solution. We are also building momentum in broad markets, particularly in IoT, with engagements at leading players, including Amazon, Arris, Cisco, Fitbit, GE, Google Nest, Honeywell, Itron, LG and others.
Our success here has been borne about by a broad and growing list of wins in adjacent markets, like industrial, energy management, security, health and fitness and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of diverse technologies, including support for WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, GPS, small cell and LTE standards. At the same time, we are building presence in key verticals like automotive with leaders such as Continental, Audi, Ford, Kia, GM and Volkswagen.
Underpinning all of our solutions is the skyrocketing demand for wireless data. Whether it's Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google or Tesla, there is a powerful and expanding ecosystem, monetizing and relying upon efficient, high speed, low latency, seamless and secure connections. This ecosystem spans across enterprise to e-commerce to social media and a burgeoning set of entirely new applications fueled by connectivity. In an effort to facilitate this massive and growing wave of data delivery, creation and movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity, MIMO and, ultimately, 5G capabilities. This dynamic requires a continuous increase in the levels of analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency, high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks' suite of products and system solutions are squarely aimed at resolving the intense performance demands facing our customers.
So to summarize, we delivered above-guidance results in the quarter, driven by increasing global demand for high-speed connectivity, coupled with strong operational execution. And as our guidance reflects, we are planning for sustained market outperformance with operating leverage and strong cash flow generation. Clearly, we remain well-positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.

So the dynamic around performance and our ability to resolve performance with systems-level solutions is coming together quite well. And you can see in the Sky, 10% to 11%, pretty solid guide up into Q4. We feel that, that's sustainable. We expect -- it's a little early for Q1, but we do expect to be up again into Q1. So that's kind of a broad statement. And if you look at China and Samsung, both of those opportunities, China being more of a broad opportunity with some of the flagship names like Huawei doing very, very well for us, and China will be one of our faster-growing areas, Samsung, we've got content gains on the GS7. That's looking good this year. Samsung will be probably a 15%-plus account for us year-over-year. We're lining out for the GS8. So what you can look at here at a high level is this continuous need for performance and Skyworks' ability to address not only our core positions in SkyOne and some of the transmit chain, but also an increasing position in analog and increasing position in the receive side, WiFi and other technologies that will allow us to grow our share."

And those solutions from Skyworks are really system-level. They include our own gallium arsenide HBT process that we have in-house, our SOI process, our deep IP and switching, our ability to craft MCMs for very, very low loss and high efficiency, delivering a complete module. So our modules can often include our own TC SAW. We've been able to move the TC frequency up to mid-band. And in some cases, if the frequencies are not applicable for TC SAW, we can address via foundry partners for bulk acoustic wave. So that's what you're seeing now in the Huawei phone.

Of the Japanese firm which are disappearing, I mean, you guys got Panasonic, [indiscernible], are they going to disappear faster than, say, if Qorvo shows up with some of these sockets? And is all this going to be kind of a footnote to overall TAM growth in the RF section in '17? I'm just trying to get your view of the bigger picture."

Our ability to hit the more challenging architectures and do it with profitable solutions and integrated solutions has served us very, very well. We're confident that you'll be able to see content gains with all of the leading accounts, regardless of baseband partitioning. We are agnostic to baseband. We work with Qualcomm. We work with Intel. We work with MediaTek, HiSilicon, all of those players. And so we don't expect any issue with that. But, yes, competitively, the companies that can hit the performance and the companies that can do it elegantly and unburden our customers with these daunting challenges that they're facing, those are the ones that are going to win, and we'll be at the top of that list. I mean, that's the whole essence of Skyworks, to try to drive a strategy around performance, integrate as much as we can, work with our customers, listen to what they need. It may be different. Every account wants something different. But be flexible enough, leveraging our internal capabilities, leveraging Mexicali for highly configurable devices, picking the right flavor of filter, but really looking at systems performance from input to output. And if we do that well, our business will follow."

So we're very confident with our ability to address. And as you know, from history with Skyworks, we're very disciplined on our CapEx, and we're careful with where we invest.

There's also another opportunity in China I think most of you know. But China is a tremendous export player to the rest of the world, and there is still 2 billion to 3 billion people out there that have no connectivity. And so we are able to feed that through our partnerships with MediaTek and Spreadtrum and even HiSilicon that often make models that will go to India, the Middle East, Africa and some of the other emerging markets. So we look good there. The recent numbers in China have been strong. We're also seeing -- I think some of these came through, some of our peer group's calls as well.

Our TC SAW capability has moved up in frequency where it was largely just a low band play, maybe 600 to 900 meg. We now have that technology well over 1 gig, getting close to 2 and 2.5 gig. And again, back to what I was mentioning before, we don't have an appetite for selling discrete filters. So when we sell a filter, it is wrapped within a complete system. So the filter contributes some level of performance. But you also have your HBT, your switch, your MCM and your ability to minimize losses within your layout. So a lot -- and that -- with Skyworks, virtually, all of that I mentioned is controlled in-house. So think about us as a system solutions player. Filters play a role in that system, but the entirety of the architecture is what matters. So we've won programs with Huawei. We're close with some other customers. There may be a few opportunities where optimal filter performance is the #1 requirement. That may be the case for some of the discrete applications or maybe some super-high performance, high band sockets. Today, perhaps, we can't address that.

Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution on the part of the Skyworks team. We exceeded our guidance, returned over $240 million in cash to our shareholders and, importantly, continued to broaden our design win pipeline, setting the stage for sustained market outperformance. 
Looking at the results in more detail, we delivered revenue of $752 million ahead of our guidance; expanded gross margins to 50.9%, up 190 basis points year-over-year; produced operating income of $275 million, with operating margins over 36%. Finally, we generated $1.24 in earnings per share, $0.03 above consensus.  Execution on revenue and margins, along with operating cost discipline, were all key elements of this performance. 
In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to gain broad market traction. Specifically during the quarter, we powered Huawei's P9 phone, incorporating 10 unique devices, including our SkyOne systems, across low, mid- and high bands; launched advanced carrier aggregation capabilities across a suite of premium and value tier accounts, including Samsung, Motorola as well as OPPO, Vivo and ZTE. We secured design wins for Continental's 4G LTE automotive systems, captured digital attenuator and multimode repeater designs at Audi and enabled enterprise radio for Google's 3.5 gigahertz band ecosystem. 
We also achieved several other milestones, including surpassing production of 2 billion filters cumulatively from our joint venture with Panasonic; ramping SkyBlue innovative technology for enhanced power management in LED flash drivers; commencing volume production of proprietary diversity receive solutions; and supporting the world's first head cam with LTE connectivity and 4K video streaming.
These major wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the Internet of Things.

Revenue for the third quarter was $751.7 million, and that's ahead of our guidance. Gross profit was $382.3 million or 50.9% of revenue, and that's in line with our guidance and up 190 basis points from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.6 million. That consists of R&D expense of $70.2 million and SG&A expense of $37.4 million. We generated $274.7 million of operating income, translating into a 36.5% operating margin. 
Our cash tax rate was 12.7%, resulting in net income of $238.1 million or $1.24 of diluted earnings per share, $0.03 ahead of our guidance. Our cash tax rate is now projected lower for fiscal 2016 at 14%. The Q3 rate was favorably impacted by a year-to-date adjustment from the prior 14% -- 14.7% annual rate. 
Turning to a summary of our third fiscal quarter cash flow metrics. We invested $57 million in capital expenditures, with depreciation of $54.6 million, generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. We returned over $240 million to shareholders via dividends and the repurchase of 3 million shares during the quarter. 
Looking at product mix for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, integrated mobile systems was 55% of revenue, broad markets was 29% and power amplifiers was 16%. 
Now moving on to our fourth fiscal quarter business outlook.  Based on the broad market traction, our new program ramps as well as the content gains Liam has outlined, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10% to 11% sequentially to $831 million at the midpoint. The double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4, followed by continued growth into our first fiscal quarter, will reduce inventory. We have level-loaded our factories and positioned ourselves well to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps with leading customers.
For fiscal Q4, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%. It's worth noting that our Q4 gross margin guidance implies a 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter, even with a lower revenue base. 
Looking at OpEx, we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat with Q3, reflecting continued cost structure discipline. 
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate of 14%. 
We expect share count to be roughly 190 million shares, driving fourth fiscal quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.43. 
Lastly, we also announced today that our board has authorized an 8% dividend increase and a new $400 million stock repurchase program, underscoring the confidence we have in our business model and our ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Our third quarter execution highlights our differentiated competitive positioning and the strength of our business model. We are levered to powerful secular technology forces, and we have spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these strategic macro trends, propelling our mobile IoT and broad market opportunity.
First is the explosive growth of mobile data across a vast set of applications and usage cases, driving performance from device to cloud and beyond. Next, we are seeing an ever-increasing expansion of connected things, with tens of billions of newly connected devices brought to market over the next 5 years. And finally, we address a tremendous ecosystem and new economy that thrives on the ability to leverage high speed and secure connectivity at the heart of their business. 
Enabling these connections is the sweet spot of our franchise. In mobile, we have growing content positions across all of the world's premier OEMs, leveraging our unique capabilities to meet our customers' increasing need for a higher-performance solution. We are also building momentum in broad markets, particularly in IoT, with engagements at leading players, including Amazon, Arris, Cisco, Fitbit, GE, Google Nest, Honeywell, Itron, LG and others.
Our success here has been borne about by a broad and growing list of wins in adjacent markets, like industrial, energy management, security, health and fitness and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of diverse technologies, including support for WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, GPS, small cell and LTE standards. At the same time, we are building presence in key verticals like automotive with leaders such as Continental, Audi, Ford, Kia, GM and Volkswagen.
Underpinning all of our solutions is the skyrocketing demand for wireless data. Whether it's Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google or Tesla, there is a powerful and expanding ecosystem, monetizing and relying upon efficient, high speed, low latency, seamless and secure connections. This ecosystem spans across enterprise to e-commerce to social media and a burgeoning set of entirely new applications fueled by connectivity. In an effort to facilitate this massive and growing wave of data delivery, creation and movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity, MIMO and, ultimately, 5G capabilities. This dynamic requires a continuous increase in the levels of analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency, high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks' suite of products and system solutions are squarely aimed at resolving the intense performance demands facing our customers.
So to summarize, we delivered above-guidance results in the quarter, driven by increasing global demand for high-speed connectivity, coupled with strong operational execution. And as our guidance reflects, we are planning for sustained market outperformance with operating leverage and strong cash flow generation. Clearly, we remain well-positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions."

I'm just going to give you a summary of why the level's where it's at. The level, we were level-loading factories to meet that second half demand. The share gains in filters and especially silicon is driven by new programs. There's specific growth assigned to some ramps, and there's essentially no risk with any of -- risk with this inventory. We also had a new hub arrangement for a large customer in Asia. That's a onetime stocking bump in inventory. And some of the projected product mix into Q4 just has longer lead times for some of the outsourced materials, and it's primarily silicon wafer. So the bottom line, we're very confident in the decline going forward and getting the turns back towards historical levels. So this is a short-term issue that we're working through based on those dynamics."

So the dynamic around performance and our ability to resolve performance with systems-level solutions is coming together quite well. And you can see in this guide, 10% to 11%, pretty solid guide up into Q4. We feel that that's sustainable. We expect -- it's a little early for Q1, but we do expect to be up again into Q1. So that's kind of a broad statement. And if you look at China and Samsung, both of those opportunities, China being more of a broad opportunity with some of the flagship names like Huawei doing very, very well for us, and China will be one of our faster-growing areas. Samsung, we've got content gains on the GS7. That's looking good this year. Samsung will be probably a 15%-plus account for us year-over-year. We're lining out for the GS8. So what you can look at here at a high level is this continuous need for performance and Skyworks' ability to address not only our core positions in SkyOne and some of the transmit chain, but also an increasing position in analog, an increasing position in receive side, WiFi and other technologies that will allow us to grow our share."

So if you think about what customers want from us, is they want solutions that resolve this tremendous complexity. And those solutions from Skyworks are really system-level. They include our own gallium arsenide HBT process that we have in-house, our SOI process, our deep IP in switching, our ability to craft MCMs for very, very low loss and high efficiency, delivering a complete module. So our modules can often include our own TC SAW. We've been able to move the TC frequency up to mid-band. And in some cases, if the frequencies are not applicable for TC SAW, we can address via foundry partners for bulk acoustic wave. So that's what you're seeing now in the Huawei phone.

Our TC SAW capability has moved up in frequency where it was largely just a low band play, maybe 600 to 900 meg. We now have that technology well over 1 gig, getting close to 2 and 2.5 gig. And again, back to what I was mentioning before, we don't have an appetite for selling discrete filters. So when we sell a filter, it is wrapped within a complete system. So the filter contributes some level of performance. But you also have your HBT, your switch, your MCM and your ability to minimize losses within your layout. So a lot -- and that -- with Skyworks, virtually all of that I mentioned is controlled in-house. So think about us as a system solutions player. Filters play a role in that system, but the entirety of the architecture is what matters. So we've won programs with Huawei. We're close with some other customers. There may be a few opportunities where optimal filter performance is the #1 requirement. That may be the case for some of the discrete applications or maybe some super-high performance, high band sockets. Today, perhaps, we can't address that.

That's still right in front -- that's still in front of us, for sure."

Liam, Skyworks, I think, has been well-known for being an above-industry average grower. It doesn't look like it's playing out that way this year, but we understand the challenges that exist with the large customer. The question is, how patient will you be with the business in getting back to above-industry average growth organically? And at what point will you feel like you have to press for M&A to diversify the business and get back to some of the growth rates and relative growth rates that we're used to seeing from the company?"

Well, first of all, I am committed and have great confidence that the organic business, the organic franchise will be an outperformer in terms of growth. Now we're a bigger company than we were a couple of years ago. There's some level of maturity in unit growth, in mobile, which has been the biggest market for us. But we're able to augment that with the share moves that we've talked about and think again about the usage case, the entities that use mobile technology and what they want. And it's daunting. So I think we'll be solid in core mobile. And I'm very comfortable with the opportunity with TAM, given some of the new architectures and road maps that we have visibility into. Broad market needs to become much more of an IoT play for us. I think that's really what broad markets means now, and we have great solutions for it. I think we need to put more people behind it, more engineering and out-bound [ph] folks behind that. That should work. Now in parallel, M&A is absolutely an opportunity for Skyworks. We have a tremendous balance sheet. We generate a ton of cash. And I think we'll be able to do the right deal when it comes about. So -- but having said all that, day to day, we're running the franchise, optimizing the franchise, doing everything we can to continue to put the growth up, the margins up, and satisfy our customers. M&A is another area that we will continue to pursue."

Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution on the part of the Skyworks team. We exceeded our guidance, returned over $240 million in cash to our shareholders and, importantly, continued to broaden our design win pipeline, setting the stage for sustained market outperformance. 
Looking at the results in more detail, we delivered revenue of $752 million ahead of our guidance; expanded gross margins to 50.9%, up 190 basis points year-over-year; produced operating income of $275 million, with operating margins over 36%. Finally, we generated $1.24 in earnings per share, $0.03 above consensus.  Execution on revenue and margins, along with operating cost discipline, were all key elements of this performance. 
In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to gain broad market traction. Specifically during the quarter, we powered Huawei's P9 phone, incorporating 10 unique devices, including our SkyOne systems, across low, mid- and high bands; launched advanced carrier aggregation capabilities across a suite of premium and value tier accounts, including Samsung, Motorola as well as OPPO, Vivo and ZTE. We secured design wins for Continental's 4G LTE automotive systems, captured digital attenuator and multimode repeater designs at Audi and enabled enterprise radio for Google's 3.5 gigahertz band ecosystem. 
We also achieved several other milestones, including surpassing production of 2 billion filters cumulatively from our joint venture with Panasonic; ramping SkyBlue innovative technology for enhanced power management in LED flash drivers; commencing volume production of proprietary diversity receive solutions; and supporting the world's first head cam with LTE connectivity and 4K video streaming.
These major wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the Internet of Things.

Revenue for the third quarter was $751.7 million, and that's ahead of our guidance. Gross profit was $382.3 million or 50.9% of revenue, and that's in line with our guidance and up 190 basis points from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.6 million. That consists of R&D expense of $70.2 million and SG&A expense of $37.4 million. We generated $274.7 million of operating income, translating into a 36.5% operating margin. 
Our cash tax rate was 12.7%, resulting in net income of $238.1 million or $1.24 of diluted earnings per share, $0.03 ahead of our guidance. Our cash tax rate is now projected lower for fiscal 2016 at 14%. The Q3 rate was favorably impacted by a year-to-date adjustment from the prior 14% -- 14.7% annual rate. 
Turning to a summary of our third fiscal quarter cash flow metrics. We invested $57 million in capital expenditures, with depreciation of $54.6 million, generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. We returned over $240 million to shareholders via dividends and the repurchase of 3 million shares during the quarter. 
Looking at product mix for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, integrated mobile systems was 55% of revenue, broad markets was 29% and power amplifiers was 16%. 
Now moving on to our fourth fiscal quarter business outlook.  Based on the broad market traction, our new program ramps as well as the content gains Liam has outlined, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10% to 11% sequentially to $831 million at the midpoint. The double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4, followed by continued growth into our first fiscal quarter, will reduce inventory. We have level-loaded our factories and positioned ourselves well to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps with leading customers.
For fiscal Q4, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%. It's worth noting that our Q4 gross margin guidance implies a 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter, even with a lower revenue base. 
Looking at OpEx, we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat with Q3, reflecting continued cost structure discipline. 
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate of 14%. 
We expect share count to be roughly 190 million shares, driving fourth fiscal quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.43. 
Lastly, we also announced today that our board has authorized an 8% dividend increase and a new $400 million stock repurchase program, underscoring the confidence we have in our business model and our ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Our third quarter execution highlights our differentiated competitive positioning and the strength of our business model. We are levered to powerful secular technology forces, and we have spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these strategic macro trends, propelling our mobile IoT and broad market opportunity.
First is the explosive growth of mobile data across a vast set of applications and usage cases, driving performance from device to cloud and beyond. Next, we are seeing an ever-increasing expansion of connected things, with tens of billions of newly connected devices brought to market over the next 5 years. And finally, we address a tremendous ecosystem and new economy that thrives on the ability to leverage high speed and secure connectivity at the heart of their business. 
Enabling these connections is the sweet spot of our franchise. In mobile, we have growing content positions across all of the world's premier OEMs, leveraging our unique capabilities to meet our customers' increasing need for a higher-performance solution. We are also building momentum in broad markets, particularly in IoT, with engagements at leading players, including Amazon, Arris, Cisco, Fitbit, GE, Google Nest, Honeywell, Itron, LG and others.
Our success here has been borne about by a broad and growing list of wins in adjacent markets, like industrial, energy management, security, health and fitness and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of diverse technologies, including support for WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, GPS, small cell and LTE standards. At the same time, we are building presence in key verticals like automotive with leaders such as Continental, Audi, Ford, Kia, GM and Volkswagen.
Underpinning all of our solutions is the skyrocketing demand for wireless data. Whether it's Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google or Tesla, there is a powerful and expanding ecosystem, monetizing and relying upon efficient, high speed, low latency, seamless and secure connections. This ecosystem spans across enterprise to e-commerce to social media and a burgeoning set of entirely new applications fueled by connectivity. In an effort to facilitate this massive and growing wave of data delivery, creation and movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity, MIMO and, ultimately, 5G capabilities. This dynamic requires a continuous increase in the levels of analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency, high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks' suite of products and system solutions are squarely aimed at resolving the intense performance demands facing our customers.
So to summarize, we delivered above-guidance results in the quarter, driven by increasing global demand for high-speed connectivity, coupled with strong operational execution. And as our guidance reflects, we are planning for sustained market outperformance with operating leverage and strong cash flow generation. Clearly, we remain well-positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions."

I'm just going to give you a summary of why the level's where it's at. The level, we were level-loading factories to meet that second half demand. The share gains in filters and especially silicon is driven by new programs. There's specific growth assigned to some ramps, and there's essentially no risk with any of -- risk with this inventory. We also had a new hub arrangement for a large customer in Asia. That's a onetime stocking bump in inventory. And some of the projected product mix into Q4 just has longer lead times for some of the outsourced materials, and it's primarily silicon wafer. So the bottom line, we're very confident in the decline going forward and getting the turns back towards historical levels. So this is a short-term issue that we're working through based on those dynamics."

We are seeing improving conditions right now. We're seeing all of our Tier 1s grow. And more importantly, we're seeing our content position expand, and their need for the content expand. So the dynamic around performance and our ability to resolve performance with systems-level solutions is coming together quite well. And you can see in this guide, 10% to 11%, pretty solid guide up into Q4. We feel that that's sustainable. We expect -- it's a little early for Q1, but we do expect to be up again into Q1. So that's kind of a broad statement. And if you look at China and Samsung, both of those opportunities, China being more of a broad opportunity with some of the flagship names like Huawei doing very, very well for us, and China will be one of our faster-growing areas. Samsung, we've got content gains on the GS7. That's looking good this year. Samsung will be probably a 15%-plus account for us year-over-year. We're lining out for the GS8. So what you can look at here at a high level is this continuous need for performance and Skyworks' ability to address not only our core positions in SkyOne and some of the transmit chain, but also an increasing position in analog, an increasing position in receive side, WiFi and other technologies that will allow us to grow our share."

And when you're in down revenue, you want the number to be below what you're normally posting. So that's good. When you do look at the guidance, we're at about 52.5% on an incremental basis, and that's simply reflective of the backdrop, the unique elements that we highlighted in the Q4 inventory. Going forward, when you're looking at our earnings model opportunity, the 53% is absolutely still our target. And we expect these incremental margins very, very quickly to get back to the 58% kind of level, which is what we have communicated consistently externally. So there's no issues there.

Having said that, our performance level's not only with the filter but the entirety of the system. So if you think about what customers want from us, is they want solutions that resolve this tremendous complexity. And those solutions from Skyworks are really system-level. They include our own gallium arsenide HBT process that we have in-house, our SOI process, our deep IP in switching, our ability to craft MCMs for very, very low loss and high efficiency, delivering a complete module. So our modules can often include our own TC SAW. We've been able to move the TC frequency up to mid-band. And in some cases, if the frequencies are not applicable for TC SAW, we can address via foundry partners for bulk acoustic wave. So that's what you're seeing now in the Huawei phone. I think you'll continue to see us extend our reach in frequencies and continue to do what customers want, really, simplify their solutions, give them the best end-to-end efficiency and the best systems-level performance."

Our TC SAW capability has moved up in frequency where it was largely just a low band play, maybe 600 to 900 meg. We now have that technology well over 1 gig, getting close to 2 and 2.5 gig. And again, back to what I was mentioning before, we don't have an appetite for selling discrete filters. So when we sell a filter, it is wrapped within a complete system. So the filter contributes some level of performance. But you also have your HBT, your switch, your MCM and your ability to minimize losses within your layout. So a lot -- and that -- with Skyworks, virtually all of that I mentioned is controlled in-house. So think about us as a system solutions player. Filters play a role in that system, but the entirety of the architecture is what matters. So we've won programs with Huawei. We're close with some other customers. There may be a few opportunities where optimal filter performance is the #1 requirement. That may be the case for some of the discrete applications or maybe some super-high performance, high band sockets. Today, perhaps, we can't address that.

Don, if I approach the gross margin issue in a different way. As you look at getting from where you are back to those 58% incremental gross margins and prioritizing the improvement drivers that can close that gap, what's on the list? It sounds like getting inventory down is one item. I think I heard you mention that filter insourcing is another, but what else is on the list? And how quickly did those different factors come into play and really provide tailwinds for the margin structure of the business?"

I mean, even though the hybrid model serves us really well, where we're able to pull -- in a down quarter, we're able to pull production capacity and externally. You're still not -- during this period, we weren't running completely full. So that's going to be something that's very quickly going to get us back up into the incremental margin track, and that's a big driver of this. And then the other thing is the new product launches as we move forward. We've said we're very focused on every new generation of product's going to provide incremental margins. So that will all be in the mix as we move forward. We're excited about some of the IoT opportunity, as Liam talked about. So those are the things, Craig, that -- and we have a lot of confidence in the visibility to get down the road to the 53% target. That's still right in front -- that's still in front of us, for sure."

The question is, how patient will you be with the business in getting back to above-industry average growth organically?

Well, first of all, I am committed and have great confidence that the organic business, the organic franchise will be an outperformer in terms of growth. Now we're a bigger company than we were a couple of years ago. There's some level of maturity in unit growth, in mobile, which has been the biggest market for us. But we're able to augment that with the share moves that we've talked about and think again about the usage case, the entities that use mobile technology and what they want. And it's daunting. So I think we'll be solid in core mobile. And I'm very comfortable with the opportunity with TAM, given some of the new architectures and road maps that we have visibility into. Broad market needs to become much more of an IoT play for us. I think that's really what broad markets means now, and we have great solutions for it. I think we need to put more people behind it, more engineering and out-bound [ph] folks behind that. That should work. Now in parallel, M&A is absolutely an opportunity for Skyworks. We have a tremendous balance sheet. We generate a ton of cash. And I think we'll be able to do the right deal when it comes about. So -- but having said all that, day to day, we're running the franchise, optimizing the franchise, doing everything we can to continue to put the growth up, the margins up, and satisfy our customers. M&A is another area that we will continue to pursue."

The Skyworks team delivered solid Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, demonstrating the resiliency and power of our business model. To put a few metrics in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $3.3 billion; expanded gross margin of 280 basis points; delivered 37.8% operating margin; generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, allowing us to return $727 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, more than double the amount from last year. And despite headwinds with one of our leading customers, we are pleased with our ability to deliver record results in fiscal year 2016.
Now on a high-level, we see strengthening dynamics in the core markets we serve. Specifically, we are in the midst of a massive sea change in the mobile usage case, given the utility and value that connected devices are beings of the world. We are supporting, and in many ways enabling, a mobile ecosystem that is cannibalizing traditional brick-and-mortar industries transforming the way we live, work and play. Wireless platforms have become virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise to cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment portals. Ultimately, these devices are a conduit for a new multi-trillion dollar connected economy across a wealth of innovative technology players.
Consider that the top 5 S&P 500 companies: namely Apple, GOOGL Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon are all monetizing these themes with mobile-centric business models. At the same time, smartphone architectures are evolving to accommodate this rapid increase in mobile data across a densely crowded spectrum. The usage case is a catalyst for higher speed, lower latency, secure and always on connectivity, which is challenging the capabilities of existing hardware and the supporting cellular infrastructure.
Our mission at Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized -- custom-level solutions, unburdening our customers while improving the user experience, with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. All of this translates into an expanding opportunity for Skyworks.
Recall that our focus is on the wireless connection, the most critical function linking the user to this incredible ecosystem. And in addition to the rise of mobile data, we are actively addressing 2 parallel growth drivers. First, connecting the unconnected. There remain 2 billion people that have yet to benefit from this dynamic ecosystem, and Skyworks will play a leading role in bringing this population online. In addition, we are committed to connecting everything as we address an estimated 20 billion new devices brought to market over the next 5 years. 
Skyworks is seamlessly enabling these massive opportunities with highly customized system solutions, supporting a broad set of protocols, including cellular LTE to WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and emerging 5G standards.
In an effort to facilitate the explosive growth of data delivery, creation, movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity and my mobile functionality. This dynamic involves a step function increase in levels of requisite analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency and high-precision filtering, as well as configurable systems integration capabilities.
Skyworks' broad portfolio and systems-level expertise are well aligned to resolve the intense performance demands facing our customers. And further, 5G will be yet another industry catalyst and significant content driver for Skyworks. This technology will drive band proliferation in higher frequencies and play squarely into our ability to address complexity with fully integrated systems. The breadth of our portfolio and our unique market reach continues to fuel a robust and diverse design win pipeline.
To illustrate, during the most recent quarter, we leveraged our leadership SkyOne architecture across scores of 4G LTE platforms, with customers like Huawei across their Honor 8 premium lineup. We are also powering the first Google-branded LTE Pixel smartphone. And we are capturing design wins across broader markets in the Internet of Things. In particular, we continue gaining traction with customers like Amazon, supporting their Echo and Tap digital assistants. We are also enabling NETGEAR's Orbi Home Router system and providing an integrated solution to Trilliant for use in their smart grid platforms.
In addition, we are deploying small cell solutions for several leading infrastructure providers in China. And in automotive, we are delivering 4G LTE solutions for use in both Land Rover and Jaguar modules -- models. These wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the IoT.
At this point, I will turn the call over to Kris for his financial review."

Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth qua",406,"Thanks, Liam.
Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus. Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.5 million, consistent with our guidance for flat sequential spending. We generated $318.4 million of operating income, translating into 38.1% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 12.6%, driving net income of $277.6 million or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.04.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a record $455 million, driven by higher profitability and significant improvements in working capital on a sequential basis. In particular, DSOs declined from 69 to 45 days. And days of inventory declined from 108 to 94 days, and we expect further reduction of inventory dollars and inventory days in Q1.
Capital expenditures were $16 million versus $57 million in Q3, reflecting the lower investment level now required for our TC SAW builder production. Further, in Q4, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of roughly $66 a share. And for fiscal '16, we have repurchased 8 million shares at an average price of just under $66 per share, helping us to reduce our share count from 195 million shares entering the fiscal year to 189 million shares exiting Q4. We also distributed over $200 million in dividends over the course of fiscal 2016, up 63% year-over-year. In summary, Skyworks returned 81% of our free cash flow or $727 million to our shareholders over the fiscal year, up from the 64% distributed in fiscal 2015.
Now moving on to our outlook. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially. At the midpoint of $902 million, we expect gross margin in the low 51% range. We expect operating expenses to be $112 million, further reducing our overall OpEx ratio to 12.4% of revenue.
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, and a cash tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 187 million shares. With our revenue growth and continued operating leverage, we plan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the first fiscal quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Players like Oppo and Vivo in China, and certainly the larger Tier 1s have been with us for a while. So on the transmit chain, we continue to move up in frequency. So we've got done a great job in low band. We're starting to win mid-band. We can address high-bandwidth foundry partners for --. So that part of the food chain looks really good. When you look at the receive side, we have a very unique strategy -- a leadership strategy. We've been able to implement high-content, high-performance solutions with the leading players in the market. That again now is starting to round out into China and to some other spaces where that value is quite unique and the performance requirements on a down link side are met so we could handle that. As you move further along though, you start to look at 5G, et cetera. We think that the way that transition will occur at with TDD as well as FDD, we have time division duplexing. Our ability to leverage TC SAW looks very good there, so we can encroach frequencies that have been the domain of bulk acoustic wave with our TC SAW with a performance advantage and also taking advantage of the unique protocols that we see in 5G."

And then if we think about China, we have -- yes, fortunately, China has changed a bit in the last couple of years. It's moved away from this 10 to 12 white box players, where it's a great deal of distribution and just kind of hoping for the best in terms of upgrade cycles and ensuring that you pick the right horses. What's happening now is it starting to coalesce around 3 or 4, or maybe 5 players with names like Huawei leading, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and then you get into a long tail of others. So we play that directly with the top 4 or 5 direct engineer-to-engineer engagements. We also play the entire China theater with our baseband partners. So close collaboration with MediaTek, Spreadtrum, HiSilicon, even Qualcomm provides a buffer of diversification. So right now, China has been a solid market. We handicap it quite well. We analyze the data from a distributors. We look at the poll rates and the upgrade data that we get from China mobile and others and we feel we have a very balanced outlook.

The Skyworks team delivered solid Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, demonstrating the resiliency and power of our business model. To put a few metrics in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $3.3 billion; expanded gross margin by 280 basis points; delivered 37.8% operating margin; generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, allowing us to return $727 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, more than double the amount from last year. And despite headwinds with one of our leading customers, we are pleased with our ability to deliver record results in fiscal year 2016.
Now at a high level, we see strengthening dynamics in the core markets we serve. Specifically, we are in the midst of a massive sea change in the mobile usage case, given the utility and value that connected devices are bringing to the world. We are supporting and in many ways, enabling a mobile ecosystem that is cannibalizing traditional brick-and-mortar industries, transforming the way we live, work and play. Wireless platforms have become virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment portals. Ultimately, these devices are a conduit for a new multi-trillion dollar connected economy across a wealth of innovative technology players.
Consider that the top 5 S&P 500 companies: namely Apple, Google Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon are all monetizing these themes with mobile-centric business models. At the same time, smartphone architectures are evolving to accommodate this rapid increase in mobile data across a densely crowded spectrum. The usage case is a catalyst for higher speed, lower latency, secure and always-on connectivity, which is challenging the capabilities of existing hardware and the supporting cellular infrastructure.
Our mission at Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized -- custom-level solutions, unburdening our customers while improving the user experience, with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. All of this translates into an expanding opportunity for Skyworks. Recall that our focus is on the wireless connection, the most critical function linking the user to this incredible ecosystem. 
And in addition to the rise of mobile data, we are actively addressing 2 parallel growth drivers. First, connecting the unconnected. There remain 2 billion people that have yet to benefit from this dynamic ecosystem, and Skyworks will play a leading role in bringing this population online. In addition, we are committed to connecting everything as we address an estimated 20 billion new devices brought to market over the next 5 years. Skyworks is seamlessly enabling these massive opportunities with highly customized system solutions, supporting a broad set of protocols, including cellular LTE to WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and emerging 5G standards.
In an effort to facilitate the explosive growth of data delivery, creation, movement and storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity and MIMO functionality. This dynamic involves a step function increase in levels of requisite analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency and high-precision filtering, as well as configurable systems integration capabilities.
Skyworks' broad portfolio and systems-level expertise are well aligned to resolve the intense performance demands facing our customers. And further, 5G will be yet another industry catalyst and significant content driver for Skyworks. This technology will drive band proliferation in higher frequencies and play squarely into our ability to address complexity with fully integrated systems. 
The breadth of our portfolio and our unique market reach continues to fuel a robust and diverse design win pipeline. To illustrate, during the most recent quarter, we leveraged our leadership SkyOne architecture across scores of 4G LTE platforms, with customers like Huawei across their Honor 8 premium lineup. We are also powering the first Google-branded LTE Pixel smartphone. And we are capturing design wins across broader markets in the Internet of Things. In particular, we continue gaining traction with customers like Amazon, supporting their Echo and Tap digital assistance. We are also enabling NETGEAR's Orbi home router system and providing an integrated solution to Trilliant for use in their smart grid platforms.
In addition, we are deploying small-cell solutions for several leading infrastructure providers in China. And in automotive, we are delivering 4G LTE solutions for use in both Land Rover and Jaguar modules -- models. These wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the IoT.
At this point, I will turn the call over to Kris for his financial review."

Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus.

Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus. Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.5 million, consistent with our guidance for flat sequential spending. We generated $318.4 million of operating income, translating into 38.1% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 12.6%, driving net income of $277.6 million or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.04.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a record $455 million, driven by higher profitability and significant improvements in working capital on a sequential basis. In particular, DSOs declined from 69 to 45 days. And days of inventory declined from 108 to 94 days, and we expect further reduction of inventory dollars and inventory days in Q1. Capital expenditures were $16 million versus $57 million in Q3, reflecting the lower investment level now required for our TC SAW filter production. 
Further, in Q4, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of roughly $66 a share. And for fiscal '16, we have repurchased 8 million shares at an average price of just under $66 per share, helping us to reduce our share count from 195 million shares entering the fiscal year to 189 million shares exiting Q4. We also distributed over $200 million in dividends over the course of fiscal 2016, up 63% year-over-year. 
In summary, Skyworks returned 81% of our free cash flow or $727 million to our shareholders over the fiscal year, up from the 64% distributed in fiscal 2015.
Now moving on to our outlook. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially. At the midpoint of $902 million, we expect gross margin in the low 51% range. We expect operating expenses to be $112 million, further reducing our overall OpEx ratio to 12.4% of revenue.
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, and a cash tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 187 million shares. With our revenue growth and continued operating leverage, we plan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the first fiscal quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

We have been known for leadership in the transmit chain, with power amplifier and power amplifier plus duplexers, SkyOne-like systems. That continues to be beneficial for us. We're probably 30% to 40% of the way of penetrating the market now. New names like Huawei are adopting the technology. Players like OPPO and Vivo in China, and certainly the larger Tier 1s have been with us for a while. So on the transmit chain, we continue to move up in frequency. So we've done a great job in low band. We're starting to win mid-band. We can address high band with foundry partners for BAWs. So that part of the food chain looks really good. When you look at the receive side, we have a very unique strategy, a leadership strategy. We've been able to implement high-content, high-performance solutions with the leading players in the market. That again now is starting to round out into China and some other spaces where that value is quite unique, and the performance requirements on the downlink side are met so we can handle that. As you move further along though, you start to look at 5G, et cetera, we think that the way that transmission will occur with TDD as well as FDD, we have time division duplexing, our ability to leverage TC SAW looks very good there. So we can encroach frequencies that had been a domain of bulk acoustic wave with our TC SAW, with performance advantage and also taking advantage of the unique protocols that we see in 5G."

For the full fiscal year, we're up about 12%. So we continue to see opportunities there. And then if we think about China, we have -- yes, fortunately, China has changed a bit in the last couple of years. It's moved away from this 10 to 12 white box players, where there's a great deal of distribution and just kind of hoping for the best in terms of upgrade cycles and ensuring that you pick the right horses. What's happening now is it's starting to coalesce around 3 or 4, or maybe 5 players with names like Huawei, leading Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then you get into a long tail of others. So we play that directly with the top 4 or 5 with direct engineer-to-engineer engagements. We also play the entire China theater with our baseband partners. So close collaboration with MediaTek, Spreadtrum, HiSilicon, even Qualcomm provides a buffer of diversification. So right now, China has been a solid market. We handicap it quite well. We analyze the data from the distributors. We look at the poll rates and the upgrade data that we get from China mobile and others. And we feel we have a very balanced outlook.

And then on MediaTek Phase 2, Phase 3, China has been very strong for you and for your competitors. And I know that Phase 2, Phase 3 only use modules with switches and amplifiers. But it sounds like MediaTek may be moving to pads earlier than expected. You currently do not sell discrete filters into that market. But if they go to pads and you're 1 of the 2 big suppliers of those parts already, why should we expect that your filter demand should step up significantly, because MediaTek would obviously be buying those filters from whoever's supplying the modules and that's going to be you and maybe Qorvo?"

So we lay out all the required amplification, transmit receipts, switching. And we do everything but the filters, and we allow the MediaTek ecosystem, the customers that use the MediaTek chipset, to pick and choose filters. That's been the way of the land here for a while.

The Skyworks team delivered solid Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, demonstrating the resiliency and power of our business model. To put a few metrics in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $3.3 billion; expanded gross margin by 280 basis points; delivered 37.8% operating margin; generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, allowing us to return $727 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, more than double the amount from last year. And despite headwinds with one of our leading customers, we are pleased with our ability to deliver record results in fiscal year 2016.
Now at a high level, we see strengthening dynamics in the core markets we serve. Specifically, we are in the midst of a massive sea change in the mobile usage case, given the utility and value that connected devices are bringing to the world. We are supporting and in many ways, enabling a mobile ecosystem that is cannibalizing traditional brick-and-mortar industries, transforming the way we live, work and play. Wireless platforms have become virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise to cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment portals. Ultimately, these devices are a conduit for a new multi-trillion dollar connected economy across a wealth of innovative technology players.
Consider that the top 5 S&P 500 companies: namely Apple, Google Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon are all monetizing these themes with mobile-centric business models. At the same time, smartphone architectures are evolving to accommodate this rapid increase in mobile data across a densely crowded spectrum. The usage case is a catalyst for higher speed, lower latency, secure and always-on connectivity, which is challenging the capabilities of existing hardware in the supporting cellular infrastructure.
Our mission at Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized custom-level solutions, unburdening our customers while improving the user experience, with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. All of this translates into an expanding opportunity for Skyworks. Recall that our focus is on the wireless connection, the most critical function linking the user to this incredible ecosystem. 
And in addition to the rise of mobile data, we are actively addressing 2 parallel growth drivers. First, connecting the unconnected. There remain 2 billion people that have yet to benefit from this dynamic ecosystem, and Skyworks will play a leading role in bringing this population online. In addition, we are committed to connecting everything as we address an estimated 20 billion new devices brought to market over the next 5 years. Skyworks is seamlessly enabling these massive opportunities with highly customized system solutions, supporting a broad set of protocols, including cellular LTE to WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and emerging 5G standards.
In an effort to facilitate the explosive growth of data delivery, creation, movement and storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity and MIMO functionality. This dynamic involves a step function increase in levels of requisite analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency and high-precision filtering, as well as configurable systems integration capabilities.
Skyworks' broad portfolio and systems-level expertise are well aligned to resolve the intense performance demands facing our customers. And further, 5G will be yet another industry catalyst and significant content driver for Skyworks. This technology will drive band proliferation in higher frequencies and play squarely into our ability to address complexity with fully integrated systems. 
The breadth of our portfolio and our unique market reach continues to fuel a robust and diverse design win pipeline. To illustrate, during the most recent quarter, we leveraged our leadership SkyOne architecture across scores of 4G LTE platforms, with customers like Huawei across their Honor 8 premium lineup. We are also powering the first Google-branded LTE Pixel smartphone. And we are capturing design wins across broader markets in the Internet of Things. In particular, we continue gaining traction with customers like Amazon, supporting their Echo and Tap digital assistance. We are also enabling NETGEAR's Orbi home router system and providing an integrated solution to Trilliant for use in their smart grid platforms.
In addition, we are deploying small-cell solutions for several leading infrastructure providers in China. And in automotive, we are delivering 4G LTE solutions for use in both Land Rover and Jaguar modules -- models. These wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the IoT.
At this point, I will turn the call over to Kris for his financial review."

Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus. Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.5 million, consistent with our guidance for flat sequential spending. We generated $318.4 million of operating income, translating into 38.1% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 12.6%, driving net income of $277.6 million or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.04.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a record $455 million, driven by higher profitability and significant improvements in working capital on a sequential basis. In particular, DSOs declined from 69 to 45 days. And days of inventory declined from 108 to 94 days, and we expect further reduction of inventory dollars and inventory days in Q1. Capital expenditures were $16 million versus $57 million in Q3, reflecting the lower investment level now required for our TC SAW filter production. 
Further, in Q4, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of roughly $66 a share. And for fiscal '16, we have repurchased 8 million shares at an average price of just under $66 per share, helping us to reduce our share count from 195 million shares entering the fiscal year to 189 million shares exiting Q4. We also distributed over $200 million in dividends over the course of fiscal 2016, up 63% year-over-year. 
In summary, Skyworks returned 81% of our free cash flow or $727 million to our shareholders over the fiscal year, up from the 64% distributed in fiscal 2015.
Now moving on to our outlook. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially. At the midpoint of $902 million, we expect gross margin in the low 51% range. We expect operating expenses to be $112 million, further reducing our overall OpEx ratio to 12.4% of revenue.
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, and a cash tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 187 million shares. With our revenue growth and continued operating leverage, we plan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the first fiscal quarter.

We have been known for leadership in the transmit chain, with power amplifier and power amplifier plus duplexers, SkyOne-like systems. That continues to be beneficial for us. We're probably 30% to 40% of the way of penetrating the market now. New names like Huawei are adopting the technology. Players like OPPO and Vivo in China, and certainly the larger Tier 1s have been with us for a while. So on the transmit chain, we continue to move up in frequency. So we've done a great job in low band. We're starting to win mid-band. We can address high band with foundry partners for BAWs. So that part of the food chain looks really good. When you look at the receive side, we have a very unique strategy, a leadership strategy. We've been able to implement high-content, high-performance solutions with the leading players in the market. That again now is starting to round out into China and some other spaces where that value is quite unique, and the performance requirements on the downlink side are immense so we can handle that. As you move further along though, you start to look at 5G, et cetera, we think that the way that transmission will occur with TDD as well as FDD, where you have time division duplexing, our ability to leverage TC SAW looks very good there. So we can encroach frequencies that had been the domain of bulk acoustic wave with our TC SAW, with performance advantage and also taking advantage of the unique protocols that we see in 5G."

So we are seeing Q1 seasonally being strong in mobile across all of our major accounts in mobile looking good, and with a great enrichment in content really steering the ship there. So we see that the IoT in broad markets business continues to look good. We're up substantially on a year-over-year basis. IoT was up into the high teens on overall broad markets. For the full fiscal year, we're up about 12%. So we continue to see opportunities there. And then if we think about China, we have -- yes, fortunately, China has changed a bit in the last couple of years. It's moved away from this 10 to 12 white box players, where there's a great deal of distribution and just kind of hoping for the best in terms of upgrade cycles and ensuring that you pick the right horses. What's happening now is it's starting to coalesce around 3 or 4, or maybe 5 players with names like Huawei leading, OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then you get into a long tail of others. So we play that directly with the top 4 or 5 with direct engineer-to-engineer engagements. We also play the entire China theater with our baseband partners. So close collaboration with MediaTek, Spreadtrum, HiSilicon, even Qualcomm provides a buffer of diversification. So right now, China has been a solid market. We handicap it quite well. We analyze the data from our distributors. We look at the poll rates and the upgrade data that we get from China mobile and others. And we feel we have a very balanced outlook. I don't expect any volatility through any double ordering or anything like that. I don't see that, but we'll maintain a cautious view as we look out."

But having said that, we continue to look at opportunities if they come about. Our track record, as you know, reflects that we are highly disciplined when it comes to M&A. A deal needs to meet all of our stringent criteria. You can see that we've done a few deals in the last few years. The Panasonic JV has closed, bringing great TC technology -- TC SAW technology in-house. We did a 5G deal a few years ago for WiFi technology. That's played out beautifully. And even a power management deal with Advance Analogic. And all of those elements play very well into our long-term strategy. So we will keep our lens open for opportunities as they come about, but again, very stringent financial criteria here."

They're driving change with our customers, and our customers are driving that change to us. And often, it's a give-and-take. And in many cases, we're at the drawing board in crafting these incredible systems that move data. So we see content being really the key focus. So we see unit growth could be 3% to 5%, maybe as high as 7% in top line units. But it's the content lever that is unique. And I think that is where -- I know that is where Skyworks outperforms.

We continue to push the frequency range in TC SAW quite nicely. We're winning a lot of products there, not only on transmit but also on diversity receive. So BAW technology is not critical. It's not mission-critical. We understand where it is in road maps and where it isn't in road maps. We are making great progress again in raising the market opportunity for our TC solutions. And also when you look at things like 5G, what we're seeing is that there's more and more TDD capability in 5G than FDD. So when you go to TDD, time division duplexing, you don't require a BAW filter or a BAW duplexer. You can do it with TC and may use frequencies. So that's another expanding opportunity for us. Now having said all that, we have access to BAW. We're using it today with some of our flagship products with foundry partners. We always take a look at make versus buy. Is it an opportunity for us to invest in-house? We'll continue to weigh that balance, but be sure that we're going to be able to address the market as we need to. We'll be able to address the filter opportunities and the systems engines that we've been delivering for years. So there's no stop on that."

But if they go to pads and you're 1 of the 2 big suppliers of those parts already, why shouldn't we expect that your filter demand should step up significantly, because MediaTek would obviously be buying those filters from whoever's supplying the modules and that's going to be you and maybe Qorvo?"

The Skyworks team delivered solid Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, demonstrating the resiliency and power of our business model. To put a few metrics in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $3.3 billion; expanded gross margin by 280 basis points; delivered 37.8% operating margin; generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, allowing us to return $727 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, more than double the amount from last year. And despite headwinds with one of our leading customers, we are pleased with our ability to deliver record results in fiscal year 2016.
Now at a high level, we see strengthening dynamics in the core markets we serve. Specifically, we are in the midst of a massive sea change in the mobile usage case, given the utility and value that connected devices are bringing to the world. We are supporting and in many ways, enabling a mobile ecosystem that is cannibalizing traditional brick-and-mortar industries, transforming the way we live, work and play. Wireless platforms have become virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise to cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment portals. Ultimately, these devices are a conduit for a new multi-trillion dollar connected economy across a wealth of innovative technology players.
Consider that the top 5 S&P 500 companies: namely Apple, Google Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon are all monetizing these themes with mobile-centric business models. At the same time, smartphone architectures are evolving to accommodate this rapid increase in mobile data across a densely crowded spectrum. The usage case is a catalyst for higher speed, lower latency, secure and always-on connectivity, which is challenging the capabilities of existing hardware in the supporting cellular infrastructure.
Our mission at Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized custom-level solutions, unburdening our customers while improving the user experience, with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. All of this translates into an expanding opportunity for Skyworks. Recall that our focus is on the wireless connection, the most critical function linking the user to this incredible ecosystem. 
And in addition to the rise of mobile data, we are actively addressing 2 parallel growth drivers. First, connecting the unconnected. There remain 2 billion people that have yet to benefit from this dynamic ecosystem, and Skyworks will play a leading role in bringing this population online. In addition, we are committed to connecting everything as we address an estimated 20 billion new devices brought to market over the next 5 years. Skyworks is seamlessly enabling these massive opportunities with highly customized system solutions, supporting a broad set of protocols, including cellular LTE to WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and emerging 5G standards.
In an effort to facilitate the explosive growth of data delivery, creation, movement and storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity and MIMO functionality. This dynamic involves a step function increase in levels of requisite analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency and high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities.
Skyworks' broad portfolio and systems-level expertise are well aligned to resolve the intense performance demands facing our customers. And further, 5G will be yet another industry catalyst and significant content driver for Skyworks. This technology will drive band proliferation in higher frequencies and play squarely into our ability to address complexity with fully integrated systems. 
The breadth of our portfolio and our unique market reach continues to fuel a robust and diverse design win pipeline. To illustrate, during the most recent quarter, we leveraged our leadership SkyOne architecture across scores of 4G LTE platforms, with customers like Huawei across their Honor 8 premium lineup. We are also powering the first Google-branded LTE Pixel smartphone. And we are capturing design wins across broader markets in the Internet of Things. In particular, we continue gaining traction with customers like Amazon, supporting their Echo and Tap digital assistance. We are also enabling NETGEAR's Orbi home router system and providing an integrated solution to Trilliant for use in their smart grid platforms.
In addition, we are deploying small-cell solutions for several leading infrastructure providers in China. And in automotive, we are delivering 4G LTE solutions for use in both Land Rover and Jaguar modules -- models. These wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the IoT.
At this point, I will turn the call over to Kris for his financial review."

Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus. Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.5 million, consistent with our guidance for flat sequential spending. We generated $318.4 million of operating income, translating into 38.1% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 12.6%, driving net income of $277.6 million or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.04.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a record $455 million, driven by higher profitability and significant improvements in working capital on a sequential basis. In particular, DSOs declined from 69 to 45 days. And days of inventory declined from 108 to 94 days, and we expect further reduction of inventory dollars and inventory days in Q1. Capital expenditures were $16 million versus $57 million in Q3, reflecting the lower investment level now required for our TC SAW filter production. 
Further, in Q4, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of roughly $66 a share. And for fiscal '16, we have repurchased 8 million shares at an average price of just under $66 per share, helping us to reduce our share count from 195 million shares entering the fiscal year to 189 million shares exiting Q4. We also distributed over $200 million in dividends over the course of fiscal 2016, up 63% year-over-year. 
In summary, Skyworks returned 81% of our free cash flow or $727 million to our shareholders over the fiscal year, up from the 64% distributed in fiscal 2015.
Now moving on to our outlook. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially. At the midpoint of $902 million, we expect gross margin in the low 51% range. We expect operating expenses to be $112 million, further reducing our overall OpEx ratio to 12.4% of revenue.
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, and a cash tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 187 million shares. With our revenue growth and continued operating leverage, we plan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the first fiscal quarter.

Let me just, on the gross margin, highlight that in fiscal '16, we improved the gross margins with 280 basis points exiting the year at 51%, which clearly demonstrates a strong operational execution in terms of margin improvements. And we definitely want to continue to further drive operational efficiencies. And we believe that we can improve the gross margins with another 100 basis points exiting the fiscal year of 2017."

We have been known for leadership in the transmit chain, with power amplifier and power amplifier plus duplexers, SkyOne-like systems. That continues to be beneficial for us. We're probably 30% to 40% of the way of penetrating the market now. New names like Huawei are adopting the technology. Players like OPPO and Vivo in China, and certainly the larger Tier 1s have been with us for a while. So on the transmit chain, we continue to move up in frequency. So we've done a great job in low band. We're starting to win mid-band. We can address high band with foundry partners for BAWs. So that part of the food chain looks really good. When you look at the receive side, we have a very unique strategy, a leadership strategy. We've been able to implement high-content, high-performance solutions with the leading players in the market. That again now is starting to round out into China and some other spaces where that value is quite unique, and the performance requirements on the downlink side are immense so we can handle that. As you move further along though, you start to look at 5G, et cetera, we think that the way that transmission will occur with TDD as well as FDD, where you have time division duplexing, our ability to leverage TC SAW looks very good there. So we can encroach frequencies that had been the domain of bulk acoustic wave with our TC SAW, with performance advantage and also taking advantage of the unique protocols that we see in 5G."

So we are seeing Q1 seasonally being strong in mobile across all of our major accounts in mobile looking good, and with a great enrichment in content really steering the ship there. So we see that the IoT in broad markets business continues to look good. We're up substantially on a year-over-year basis. IoT was up into the high teens on overall broad markets. For the full fiscal year, we're up about 12%. So we continue to see opportunities there. And then if we think about China, we have -- yes, fortunately, China has changed a bit in the last couple of years. It's moved away from this 10 to 12 white box players, where there's a great deal of distribution and just kind of hoping for the best in terms of upgrade cycles and ensuring that you pick the right horses. What's happening now is it's starting to coalesce around 3 or 4, or maybe 5 players with names like Huawei leading, OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then you get into a long tail of others. So we play that directly with the top 4 or 5 with direct engineer-to-engineer engagements. We also play the entire China theater with our baseband partners. So close collaboration with MediaTek, Spreadtrum, HiSilicon, even Qualcomm provides a buffer of diversification. So right now, China has been a solid market. We handicap it quite well. We analyze the data from our distributors. We look at the poll rates and the upgrade data that we get from China mobile and others. And we feel we have a very balanced outlook. I don't expect any volatility through any double ordering or anything like that. I don't see that, but we'll maintain a cautious view as we look out."

We continue to push the frequency range in TC SAW quite nicely. We're winning a lot of products there, not only on transmit but also on diversity receive. So BAW technology is not critical. It's not mission-critical. We understand where it is in road maps and where it isn't in road maps. We are making great progress again in raising the market opportunity for our TC solutions. And also when you look at things like 5G, what we're seeing is that there's more and more TDD capability in 5G than FDD. So when you go to TDD, time division duplexing, you don't require a BAW filter or a BAW duplexer. You can do it with TC and may use frequencies. So that's another expanding opportunity for us. Now having said all that, we have access to BAW. We're using it today with some of our flagship products with foundry partners. We always take a look at make versus buy. Is it an opportunity for us to invest in-house? We'll continue to weigh that balance, but be sure that we're going to be able to address the market as we need to. We'll be able to address the filter opportunities and the systems engines that we've been delivering for years. So there's no stop on that."

The Skyworks team delivered solid Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, demonstrating the resiliency and power of our business model. To put a few metrics in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $3.3 billion; expanded gross margin by 280 basis points; delivered 37.8% operating margin; generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, allowing us to return $727 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, more than double the amount from last year. And despite headwinds with one of our leading customers, we are pleased with our ability to deliver record results in fiscal year 2016.
Now at a high level, we see strengthening dynamics in the core markets we serve. Specifically, we are in the midst of a massive sea change in the mobile usage case, given the utility and value that connected devices are bringing to the world. We are supporting and in many ways, enabling a mobile ecosystem that is cannibalizing traditional brick-and-mortar industries, transforming the way we live, work and play. Wireless platforms have become virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise to cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment portals. Ultimately, these devices are a conduit for a new multi-trillion dollar connected economy across a wealth of innovative technology players.
Consider that the top 5 S&P 500 companies: namely Apple, Google Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon are all monetizing these themes with mobile-centric business models. At the same time, smartphone architectures are evolving to accommodate this rapid increase in mobile data across a densely crowded spectrum. The usage case is a catalyst for higher speed, lower latency, secure and always-on connectivity, which is challenging the capabilities of existing hardware in the supporting cellular infrastructure.
Our mission at Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized custom-level solutions, unburdening our customers while improving the user experience, with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. All of this translates into an expanding opportunity for Skyworks. Recall that our focus is on the wireless connection, the most critical function linking the user to this incredible ecosystem. 
And in addition to the rise of mobile data, we are actively addressing 2 parallel growth drivers. First, connecting the unconnected. There remain 2 billion people that have yet to benefit from this dynamic ecosystem, and Skyworks will play a leading role in bringing this population online. In addition, we are committed to connecting everything as we address an estimated 20 billion new devices brought to market over the next 5 years. Skyworks is seamlessly enabling these massive opportunities with highly customized system solutions, supporting a broad set of protocols, including cellular LTE to WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and emerging 5G standards.
In an effort to facilitate the explosive growth of data delivery, creation, movement and storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity and MIMO functionality. This dynamic involves a step function increase in levels of requisite analog and mixed-signal performance, enhanced power efficiency and high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities.
Skyworks' broad portfolio and systems-level expertise are well aligned to resolve the intense performance demands facing our customers. And further, 5G will be yet another industry catalyst and significant content driver for Skyworks. This technology will drive band proliferation in higher frequencies and play squarely into our ability to address complexity with fully integrated systems. 
The breadth of our portfolio and our unique market reach continues to fuel a robust and diverse design win pipeline. To illustrate, during the most recent quarter, we leveraged our leadership SkyOne architecture across scores of 4G LTE platforms, with customers like Huawei across their Honor 8 premium lineup. We are also powering the first Google-branded LTE Pixel smartphone. And we are capturing design wins across broader markets in the Internet of Things. In particular, we continue gaining traction with customers like Amazon, supporting their Echo and Tap digital assistance. We are also enabling NETGEAR's Orbi home router system and providing an integrated solution to Trilliant for use in their smart grid platforms.
In addition, we are deploying small-cell solutions for several leading infrastructure providers in China. And in automotive, we are delivering 4G LTE solutions for use in both Land Rover and Jaguar modules -- models. These wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the IoT.

Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus.

Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus. Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.5 million, consistent with our guidance for flat sequential spending. We generated $318.4 million of operating income, translating into 38.1% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 12.6%, driving net income of $277.6 million or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.04.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a record $455 million, driven by higher profitability and significant improvements in working capital on a sequential basis. In particular, DSOs declined from 69 to 45 days. And days of inventory declined from 108 to 94 days, and we expect further reduction of inventory dollars and inventory days in Q1. Capital expenditures were $16 million versus $57 million in Q3, reflecting the lower investment level now required for our TC SAW filter production. 
Further, in Q4, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of roughly $66 a share. And for fiscal '16, we have repurchased 8 million shares at an average price of just under $66 per share, helping us to reduce our share count from 195 million shares entering the fiscal year to 189 million shares exiting Q4. We also distributed over $200 million in dividends over the course of fiscal 2016, up 63% year-over-year. 
In summary, Skyworks returned 81% of our free cash flow or $727 million to our shareholders over the fiscal year, up from the 64% distributed in fiscal 2015.
Now moving on to our outlook. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially. At the midpoint of $902 million, we expect gross margin in the low 51% range. We expect operating expenses to be $112 million, further reducing our overall OpEx ratio to 12.4% of revenue.
Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, and a cash tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 187 million shares. With our revenue growth and continued operating leverage, we plan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the first fiscal quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

We have been known for leadership in the transmit chain, with power amplifier and power amplifier plus duplexers, SkyOne-like systems. That continues to be beneficial for us. We're probably 30% to 40% of the way of penetrating the market now. New names like Huawei are adopting the technology. Players like OPPO and Vivo in China, and certainly the larger Tier 1s have been with us for a while. So on the transmit chain, we continue to move up in frequency. So we've done a great job in low band. We're starting to win mid-band. We can address high band with foundry partners for BAWs. So that part of the food chain looks really good. When you look at the receive side, we have a very unique strategy, a leadership strategy. We've been able to implement high-content, high-performance solutions with the leading players in the market. That again now is starting to round out into China and some other spaces where that value is quite unique, and the performance requirements on the downlink side are immense so we can handle that. As you move further along though, you start to look at 5G, et cetera, we think that the way that transmission will occur with TDD as well as FDD, where you have time division duplexing, our ability to leverage TC SAW looks very good there. So we can encroach frequencies that had been the domain of bulk acoustic wave with our TC SAW, with performance advantage and also taking advantage of the unique protocols that we see in 5G."

So we see that the IoT in broad markets business continues to look good. We're up substantially on a year-over-year basis. IoT was up into the high teens on overall broad markets. For the full fiscal year, we're up about 12%. So we continue to see opportunities there. And then if we think about China, we have -- yes, fortunately, China has changed a bit in the last couple of years. It's moved away from this 10 to 12 white box players, where there's a great deal of distribution and just kind of hoping for the best in terms of upgrade cycles and ensuring that you pick the right horses. What's happening now is it's starting to coalesce around 3 or 4, or maybe 5 players with names like Huawei leading, OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then you get into a long tail of others. So we play that directly with the top 4 or 5 with direct engineer-to-engineer engagements. We also play the entire China theater with our baseband partners. So close collaboration with MediaTek, Spreadtrum, HiSilicon, even Qualcomm provides a buffer of diversification. So right now, China has been a solid market. We handicap it quite well. We analyze the data from our distributors. We look at the poll rates and the upgrade data that we get from China mobile and others. And we feel we have a very balanced outlook. I don't expect any volatility through any double ordering or anything like that. I don't see that, but we'll maintain a cautious view as we look out."

It's not mission-critical. We understand where it is in road maps and where it isn't in road maps. We are making great progress again in raising the market opportunity for our TC solutions. And also when you look at things like 5G, what we're seeing is that there's more and more TDD capability in 5G than FDD. So when you go to TDD, time division duplexing, you don't require a BAW filter or a BAW duplexer. You can do it with TC and may use frequencies. So that's another expanding opportunity for us. Now having said all that, we have access to BAW. We're using it today with some of our flagship products with foundry partners. We always take a look at make versus buy. Is it an opportunity for us to invest in-house? We'll continue to weigh that balance, but be sure that we're going to be able to address the market as we need to.
