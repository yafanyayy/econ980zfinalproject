Joining me and Deb on the call are Carol Meyrowitz; and Scott Goldenberg. Before I begin, I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of myself, our entire management team and our organization to express our sincerest gratitude to Carole. For 9 years as CEO and over a long tenure at the company, Carol has led TJX to great success with achievements too numerous to cover on this call. I am delighted that in her new role as Executive Chairman, Carol and I will continue our 20-plus years of working together. Thank you, Carol. 
I'd like to start by saying that 2015 was another terrific year for TJX. We surpassed $30 billion in sales and consolidated comp sales increased a strong 5%, which is well above our plan. We are extremely pleased that the comp is driven entirely by customer traffic. Consumers are loving our stores and shopping us even more frequently. We are convinced we are gaining market share profitably around the world. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 5% also above our expectations and over a strong 12% increase the prior year. 2015 marks the 20th consecutive year of comp and EPS gains for TJX. In our 39-year history, we have seen only one comp store sales decline. We are also very pleased that we drove merchandise margin increases while offering even more amazing values to our customers. It's important to note that we achieved these results despite significant foreign currency headwinds, as well as reinvesting in the business. Further, we were thrilled that our momentum continued into the fourth quarter. We ended the year with fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our plans. It's also great to see such consistency in our business, with comps hitting 5% to 6% every quarter of the year. 
Our 2015 performance once again demonstrates the power of our differentiated flexible business model to succeed across many different geographic, economic and retail environments.  We were thrilled to expand our global footprint into Austria, the Netherlands and Australia in 2015. So now, we operate in 9 countries across 3 continents. Looking ahead, I am very excited about the future of TJX. We entered 2016 with terrific momentum, and the year is off to a strong start. We are convinced that we can continue growing our customer base around the world and are pursuing various opportunities to capture market share. To support our goals for growth, we are continuing to make strategic investments in the business. I am also confident that we are making the right investments today that will help us grow to $40 billion and beyond. As always, we have a management team that is passionate about achieving its plans, and more importantly, passionate about striving to surpass them. 
Before I continue, I'll now turn the call over to Scott to recap our fourth quarter and full year numbers."

Again, we are thrilled that our 5% consolidated comp increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. It was also great to see that customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase at each of our divisions. We believe we are gaining share profitably across all geographies. As a reminder, our comp sales exclude e-commerce. Diluted earnings per share were $3.33, a 5% increase over last year's adjusted $3.16 and exceeded our most recent guidance. It's important to note that our full year EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 4% due to our wage initiative, as well as our incremental investments and pension costs. For the full year, consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.8%, down 50 basis points versus last year's adjusted 12.3%. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 30 basis points versus last year, and merchandise margins were also up.  SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.8%, up 70 basis points versus last year's ratio. 
Now to our fourth quarter results, consolidated comps increased 6% over a 4% increase last year and well above our plan. This marks our 28th consecutive quarter of consolidated comp store sales growth. We were very pleased that our fourth quarter comp was also entirely driven by customer traffic. As with the year, traffic was also the primary driver of each division's quarterly comp increase. Diluted earnings per share were $0.99, a 6% increase versus last year and also well above our plan. It's important to note that our fourth quarter EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 5% due to our wage initiative, as well as incremental investments and pension costs.  Consolidated pretax profit margins was 11.9%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.7%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was due to an increase in merchandise margin and strong buying and occupancy leverage on the 6% comp. We are very pleased with our gross margin and merchandise margin increases despite the significant negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International, and increased costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.7%, up 100 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to our wage initiative as we had anticipated, as well as contribution to TJX's charitable foundations, higher incentive compensation accruals due to the company's above-plan performance and increased supply chain costs. At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in transit and e-commerce inventories were up 6% on a constant-currency basis. We took advantage of some amazing packaway opportunities during the fourth quarter and ended the year in an excellent inventory position. 
Now to recap our fourth quarter performance by division, Marmaxx finished 2016 with its best quarter of the year. Comps grew by a very strong 6% on top of a very solid 3% increase last year. Once again, it was terrific to see that the comp increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. As we had planned, with our merchandising and value strategies, we saw a significant increase in transactions and units sold, as well as a decrease in average ticket. Apparel, including accessories and home, both had excellent performance, which is nice to see in today's retail environment. Segment profit margin was flat as Marmaxx's significant merchant margin increased and buying and occupancy leverage offset the expected impact of our wage initiative, higher supply chain costs and investments in e-commerce. We begin the new year with great momentum at our largest division. 
HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps increased 7% over last year's strong 11% growth and segment profit margin was up 60 basis points. We are very pleased with HomeGoods' strong increase and merchandise margins. Customers clearly love HomeGoods as we keep growing this premium brand. At TJX Canada, comps grew a phenomenal 14% over a strong 7% increase last year. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 140 basis points primarily due to transactional foreign exchange, as well as higher incentive compensation accruals due to TJX Canada's above-plan performance. I want to point out that the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had a significant negative impact on this division's merchandise margins. Once again, the efforts that our Canadian organization made to mitigate this currency impact were terrific and highly effective. We are very pleased that all 3 teams delivered great performance. 
Now to our businesses beyond North America, these include our European business and Trade Secret in Australia, which together now comprise TJX International. TJX International's comp growth was 1% and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 170 basis points. This was primarily due to investments in new countries and transactional foreign exchange, as well as some deleverage on the 1% comp. While the fourth quarter was softer than we would have liked, we are pleased with the improving comp trends we are seeing in this business. Further and TJX international delivered an excellent year. On our e-commerce sites in the U.S. and U.K., we also offered customers a constant flow of gift-giving selections at amazing values throughout the holiday season. We have added thousands of new brands to TJMaxx.com since we launched and plan to continue adding new categories and brands to all of our sites. 
Now to our financial strength and shareholder distributions, our business continues to generate excellent cash flows and strong financial returns. In fiscal '16, free cash flow was $2 billion and ROIC was a strong 22%, one of the highest we have seen in retail. This is thanks, in large part due to our disciplined approach to capital allocation. As always, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs, while simultaneously reinvesting in the business for the near and long term. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our first quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,325258238,939353,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. First, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights from the fourth quarter. Again, we were thrilled to end 2015 with such a strong finish. Customer response to our exciting assortments and great values was terrific this holiday selling season",1875,"Thanks, Scott. First, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights from the fourth quarter. Again, we were thrilled to end 2015 with such a strong finish. Customer response to our exciting assortments and great values was terrific this holiday selling season, as well as during the post holiday period. Every year, we work to improve over the year before. I believe that our marketing in-store initiatives, gift-giving and constant freshness were even better than last year and truly sets us apart from other retailers. We believe this drove new shoppers to our stores and covered more frequent shopping trips. Also, like to transition our stores after the holidays with our stores looking extremely fresh. Now I'd like to talk about the major strengths that differentiate TJX from so many other retailers. We're convinced that the same elements of our business that differentiate us from other retailers are also key to our continued successful global growth. Further we believe these elements would be extremely difficult for others to replicate. First, we have a world-class global buying organization that I believe is the best in retail. There are over 1,000 people in our buying organization, and our total merchandising organization, which includes our plant allocation group, is nearly double that size. Our stores are located in 11 countries across 4 continents and we source from a universe that now numbers more than 18,000 vendors and over 100 countries. This is why we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Many in our merchandise organization have been with us for multiple decades, and we have dedicated nearly 4 years to cultivate the talent and off price expertise of our teams as well as improving our buying processes. Further we take enormous pride in our strong corporate culture, which I'm convinced is a key factor in our recruiting and retaining top talent. 
Second, our global supply chain and distribution network have been developed and refined over nearly 4 years to support a highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. There is no off-the-shelf off-price inventory management offered to support a global business model like ours, which is why our proprietary IT systems are designed specifically to handle our off-price buying. Our distribution network can process buys as small as 100 units to over 1 million units from any one of our thousands of vendors in a timely and efficient manner, then allocate that merchandise to the right stores at the right time. We continue to invest in our supply chain ahead of our store growth to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to support new stores, new chains and new countries. 
Third, we are capitalizing on our global presence. TJX is the only major international off-price apparel and home fashion retailer in the world. We are one of the few major U.S. retailers to have expanded successfully internationally. We're the largest off-price retailer in the U.S. and Canada and remain the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Europe and Australia. We operate highly integrated and synergistic businesses across many geographies and have built global teams and international infrastructures over many decades. We see our international depth and expertise as a major advantage as we continue to expand our value concept around the world. These key strengths allow TJX to be one of the most flexible retailers in the world. Our best-in-class buying organization, combined with our vast vendor universal allow us to be nimble in and capitalize on the best opportunities. The flexibility of our stores and distribution network allow us to respond quickly to changing customer preferences and trends across many different retail and consumer environments around the world. Further, while we offer consumers many different change in merchandise categories, each of our 4 major divisions operate on the same off-price business model. We function as one TJX and leverage talent, infrastructure, ideas and expertise across the chains. This is an important advantage when opening new stores, launching in change, entering new markets or tapping new seeds. All of these factor give us great confidence that we can continue our successful profitable global growth. Further, I believe that it is often underestimated how difficult it would be for other retailers to try and replicate these strengths. These key advantages also underscore our confidence and our ability to gain market share profitably and achieve our long-term goals for growth. 
Let me take a moment to review our major growth drivers, and there are really 3: our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We were very pleased with our traffic in all divisions of 2015, yet we're convinced that significant opportunity remains to gain market share. We reached an extremely wide demographic and we like the growth and our customer base across all ages, particularly millennials across all of our divisions. To attract more new customers, we will continue to leverage our Global Marketing capabilities. During the holiday season, we again leveraged our tri-branded campaigns across the U.S. and Canada, and believe that they help drive more customers to our stores. In 2016, we are strategically shifting our marketing dollars to spend more in certain markets and geographies to capitalize on our biggest opportunities. We are continuing our integrating marketing approach to engage with shoppers from all ages through television, radio, digital, mobile and social media. To encourage more frequent visits and cross shopping of our brands, we are growing our successful loyalty programs in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We also continue to upgrade the shopping experience and plan to remodel about 240 stores across the company in 2016. We are pleased to see our overall customer satisfaction scores increase in 2015, but still see room to become even better on this front. we are confident our wage initiative will help us attract and retain talented store associates. I should note that while we are always working on improving efficiencies in our business, we haven't taken any customer facing action that would diminish the pleasant shopping experience that we wanted in store for our customers. Importantly, we see e-commerce as another great way to drive customer traffic both online and to our other stores. 
Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. As I just discussed, our ability to leverage our global teams, infrastructure and operational expertise, are major reasons for our confidence in being able to continue to open stores profitably around the world. With over 3,600 stores today, we see the potential to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. To be clear, this reflects the potential we see with our existing chains in our existing countries alone, but beyond this, we believe huge opportunity remains. In North America, we see the potential to add over 1,400 stores. In the U.S., we are far from finished growing our largest, most profitable division. Marmaxx is nearly a $20 billion business and T.J. Maxx and Marshalls each have more than 1,000 stores, yet we are confident meaningful opportunity remains to continue growing both change. Long-term, we see my max going to approximately 3,000 stores. At HomeGoods, plenty of whitespace remains across the U.S. We see this chain expanding into at least 1,000 stores, almost double its existing base. And in Canada, our long-term target is about 500 stores. In Europe, we see the long-term potential to expand to 975 stores, almost double our current base. There's reflects our potential receive for T.K. Maxx and our current geographies alone and HomeSense in the U.K. And this is before we consider the growth prospects we see in other countries. We are pleased with our launches in Austria and in the Netherlands, which underscored our confidence entering into Australia. We see the potential to develop Trade Secret in Australia similar to our grow our Canadian business, from a 5 store chain to that country's leading off-price retailer. Australia has a population of about 2/3 the size of Canada's with seminar customer demographics. This underscores our confidence in our ability to grow Trade Secret to be at least a 125 store chain. Clearly, this number could be conservative and reflect just the potential we see in the early days of opening this business. 
Before I wrap up on store growth, I want to say that we are extremely pleased to have grown our store base by 1825 stores for a strong 5% in fiscal 2016. In addition to being at the upper end of our 4% to 5% range over the last several years, we plan to continue with this pace in fiscal 2017. It also feels great to say that even in today's volatile retail environment, we closed only one store last year. The core that's on a store base of over 3,600 stores. All of this speaks to the fundamental strength of our business. Our disciplined approach to real estate and our decades of operating expertise in the U.S. and internationally. I should note that while we are opportunistic in our real estate strategies as well and see volatility in the marketplace as an advantage for our business. 
The third major growth driver is new seeds and innovation. We are constantly testing new seeds and ideas across the company that can reap tremendous benefits for the future. We are very happy with the early read in our new Sierra Trading Post stores and we will be thrilled for STP to eventually become a fourth major chain in the U.S. and Canada. Also, our successful expansion of T.K. Maxx into  Austria and the Netherlands for the demonstrates that our value proposition can work in many other European markets. 
Okay, I wrap up with our outlook for 2016. We are delighted with the great momentum and the business and a healthy start to the year. Our business is very strong. We have many initiatives underway to drive sales and traffic. Our planned for earnings per share growth this year of flex the expected negative impact with foreign currency and our wage initiative. In addition, investing in initiatives to gain market share and to strengthen our leadership position around the world remains a priority. We are committed to carefully balance in our growth in investments and we remain disciplined in our approach. In 2016, we plan on continuing investing in our stores, talent, supply chain, IT and new seeds. Our strategy is to invest ahead of our growth, and we are confident that we are making the right investments today that will give us a strong foundation for the future. Importantly, we are investing initiatives in which we have decades of knowledge and expertise. All of this gives us great confidence that our investment strategies will be successful. 
We see many exciting opportunities to expand TJX both domestically and internationally. We are confident that these investments we are making today will strongly position us to reach the next level of growth. As always, we are laser-focused on beating our plans. I could not be more excited about the future of TJX. This is a great company, and I am confident we will continue to deliver successful growth for many years to come. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."
306688,325258238,939353,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie. Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.38, which would be down 1% to up 2% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As Ernie mentioned, similar to last year, in fiscal '17",1080,"Thanks, Ernie. Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.38, which would be down 1% to up 2% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As Ernie mentioned, similar to last year, in fiscal '17, we are planning our earnings per share to reflect have a negative impact from a couple of factors: First, similar to last year, we expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to negatively impact fiscal '17 EPS growth by approximately 4%. Again,, this year it is primarily the result of the dramatic decline in the Canadian dollars and British pound rates versus the prior year. Of course, it's important to remember that FX could moderate or benefit us in the future. Secondly, as we detailed on our third quarter earnings call, we are assuming that our wage initiative will have a negative impact of about 4% to fiscal '17 EPS growth. As always, we are actually focused on controlling costs and striving to succeed our plans. Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in $32.2 billion to $32.5 billion range, a 4% to 5% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. We are assuming a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis. We expect pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.9% to 11.1% versus 11.8% in fiscal '16. We're planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.3% to 28.5% versus 28.8% last year. In terms of the pressure we see currency having on our mark on and merchandise margins at TJX Canada and TJX International, we expect the negative impact to be even larger than last year. Excluding the current headwind, we would expect the consolidated underlying merchandise margin to be flat to slightly up this year versus last year. We're planning SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.2% to 17.3% versus 16.8% last year primarily due to our wage initiative. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.2%; net interest expense of about $54 million; and a weighted average share count of approximately $662 million. Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $20.5 billion to $20.7 billion and segment profit margin in the range of 13.6% to 13.8%. As a reminder in fiscal '17, we are planning Marmaxx's average ticket lower in the first half of the year and essentially flat for the second half. At HomeGoods, we expect comp increases, comps to increase 3% to 4% on sales of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion and segment profit margin to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%. For TJX Canada, we are planning a comp increase of 3% to 4% on sales of $2.9 billion [ph] and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 12.1% to 12.3%. At TJX International, we're expecting a comp increase of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.6 billion and adjusted pretax margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.6% to 5.8%. 
Now to Q1 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70 versus last year's $0.69 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of approximately 2% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 3% due to our wage initiative. We're modeling first quarter consolidated sales in the $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion range. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. First quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.2% to 10.4% versus 11.1% the prior year. We're anticipating first quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.2%  flat-to-down 10 basis points versus the prior year. We're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the 17.8% to 17.9% range versus 17.0% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4%, net interest expense of about $13 million and a weighted average share count of approximately $669 million. It's important to remember that our guidance for the first quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the first quarter. 
Moving to our store growth plan for fiscal '17, we plan to add approximately 195 new stores, which would bring our your end total to about 3,809 stores. This represents store growth of approximately 5% and is at the upper end of our range for the last several years. I want to point out that our plans this year assume no store closings across our entire global store base. Beginning with the U.S., our plans calls for us to open about 60 additional stores at Marmaxx and 50 more stores at HomeGoods. We also plan to open about 5 additional Sierra Trading Post stores this year. In Canada, we plan to add about 30 new stores. This reflects the opportunities we see to further expand our footprint into world markets as well as our nationwide opportunities for Marshalls. In Europe, we plan to continue a significant base of store growth, opening approximately 50 stores this year. This includes our plans to continue expanding into Austria and the Netherlands. 
I'll wrap up with our financial strength and stability, which clearly gives us tremendous [indiscernible]. In fiscal '17, we plan to continue our balanced approach through the use of cash with our increase investment to gain share in support of our growth initiative. We're planning capital spending to increase to approximately $1.1 billion. In fiscal '17, we expect that the Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 24% on top of our 20% increase last year. This would mark our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. We're planning to buy back $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of TJX stock. Even with this level of shareholder distributions, we still plan to end fiscal '17 with $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments which points to our significant financial flexibility.

So we've been successful of recent by ensuring our value was the sharpest out there. So we do not want -- we do not want to mess with that and even though we're getting hit on the buying of The Goods in U.S. dollars with the Canadian dollar translation, we still haven't moved our values and it's, I believe, if you look at our Canadian comps, it's helping us gain significant market share, actually in that market.

On the investing, first of all, we do what we think makes sense in each area. Clearly, we look at each like international we look at there versus system versus e-commerce. We look at a strategy independently of each and decide what do we think is the right long-term and the appropriate amount. So I'd tell you on our e-commerce business, we've discussed this before, it's a relatively small piece of our business and we are taking approach there of investing in a very methodical way and a careful way. Having said that, we're very happy with the business, where it is today. We just will -- we will keep that in ratio to the benefit and where we think we are headed with that. Systems, there's certainly a maintenance side to that and part of running the business that we are cognizant of. And international, clearly, you can tell from what we talked about in the script, that is a key focus for us, and we have shown to make our model work whenever we replicate our model wherever we go. In fact, as I believe I mentioned in Australia, we are pretty happy with our early indicators there going in fairly recently and already experiencing, I think some pretty good success. So I think we can't give you specifics by the different investments. We would tell they're all long-term-oriented and they are all doing what makes sense for the business. In terms of color post-holiday, also, as we mentioned, we're feeling very bullish, I would say. Starting the new year off strong, and that's across many categories. Yes, there are plentiful opportunities in the market as we talked about going back at the last 2 quarter calls. I think Carol and I both discussed that with you in the last 2 quarters, but nothing has really changed in the environment out there. In fact, there just continues to be a lot of opportunities, if anything. We are at the high points taking advantage of packaways but still having our control in merchants making sure we don't buy too much, actually because there's so much to choose from. So we're feeling really, really strong about the positioning post-holiday. The liquidity is in a good position. That is feeling healthy. And I guess, that's that. And I will ask Scott to jump into the SG&A."

Moving to the SG&A, no, the comp break even is closer to -- is a solid 3%. It used to be a bit lower, but more having to do with the -- this is going back several years, with the significant opportunities that were at that point in terms of cost efficiencies and lower line crude on merchandise inventories as we are bringing down substantially our inventories.

So we're able to take things that are a little out of season here and go there. Now you have to keep in mind we are dealing with 35 stores versus billions, right. So it's not a major swing impact for like the Marmaxx guys or the home business year but there is a strong benefit for that new Australian business for Trade Secret because they're able to take advantage, to your point, of the off-season goods. It becomes not a packaway, it becomes an in-season use there. And there's going to be some benefit additionally in terms of reading some trends on a certain fashion item that will be able to go ahead of it there. Like we're able to do with our down sales stores here as well. But even there, a little earlier, that will give us some reads actually on some fashion items ahead of the curve, so we can maybe take advantage of that back here. So great question, yes. And we're happy. Again, as I said before, very happy with -- we have what we've already done with that and we have some great people working there. We have one, a senior executive that I think we talked about this before from our Canada division that has relocated there, as well as a handful of other TJX Associates. So we are really TJX-sizing that business rather quickly and already and you guys are familiar with how we pride ourselves on turning fast to create the treasure hunt. That division is already turning significantly, significantly faster than it did last year with a huge reduction in inventory. So all good signs and I think if the subject you guy bought up about the way we buy it would just help that. That will be another benefit in the future."

The reason we -- if you look actually if you look at our store growth that we've laid out, that tells you how bullish we are and then if you look at, I think some of the other reports that have been out recently over the last couple of months and other types of retail that do not have store growth going the other way, so to speak, I think that would tell you that we believe the off-price is the big opportunity. And we just never, sometimes there's a concern there's going to be a lack of goods as we continue to grow in out of all these stores, just as you know, I think I said it like 20 minutes ago, we actually have to hold the merchants back. There's just so much goods out there. It goes in ways sometimes a little more than others, yes. Right now, it is a little bit more of that but even if it cuts back a little, there's still more goods that we can take in. So we're just bullish on this model.

The first one is clearly the foreign exchange issue has been in flux. By the way, someday that could go the other way and actually benefit us, but right now, that's been in flux as we just talked about. Secondly, there's a negative impact from our wage initiative which Scott referred to, and it's bigger in FY '17 that we're entering. We expect it by the way, in FY '18 to go back to '16 levels, but it's still significant and the other, again, there is a bit of influx is that we could be further impacted if additional cities, states or countries increase in their minimum wage. So that, again,, hits, us there potentially but we don't know by how much.

Part of that was a mix component. If you remember, there really are 2 facets, one buying, because of the nature of the environment right now, buying the same goods for less, but then you have the other half of the component which was really just we juggled some of the mixes and the penetrations of certain mixes with lower ticket. We're not. So it created a mix content issue. To your question, we would think that's going to happen, the only thing I would tell you is we have bought so little of that time period at this point because we're so opportunistic that we have so much open to buy for the second quarter that we could end up, yes, we could end up slightly down in ticket again. I doubt it would be to the degree that we've had it last year or the year before, but it could be down a few points. It's possible, because we don't want to predict one of the best parts of this business is when we have significant open to buy. We don't feel a need to call it today on when we could end up then. We want to go with the best buyers that are out there."

We tried to kind of focus on what we're feeling here. What we feel in general is an environment of, again, a lot of availability of merchandise. And so we don't know where that -- some of its department stores, some of it's specialty stores, some of it's other types of stores. So that's really our only parameter. In terms of our promotional activity, again, not sure. We do see their ticket actually declining is our perception.

We surpassed $30 billion in sales and consolidated comp sales increased a strong 5%, which is well above our plan. We are extremely pleased that the comp was driven entirely by customer traffic. Consumers are loving our stores and shopping us even more frequently. We are convinced we are gaining market share profitably around the world. 
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 5%, also above our expectations and over a strong 12% increase the prior year. 2015 marks the 20th consecutive year of comp and EPS gains for TJX. In our 39-year history, we have seen only one comp store sales decline. 
We're also very pleased that we drove merchandise margin increases while offering even more amazing values to our customers. It's important to note that we achieved these results despite significant foreign currency headwinds as well as reinvesting in the business. 
Further, we were thrilled that our momentum continued into the fourth quarter. We ended the year with fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our plans. It's also great to see such consistency in our business with comps hitting 5% to 6% every quarter of the year. 
Our 2015 performance once again demonstrates the power of our differentiated, flexible business model to succeed across many different geographic, economic and retail environments.  We were thrilled to expand our global footprint into Austria, the Netherlands and Australia in 2015. So now we operate in 9 countries across 3 continents. 
Looking ahead, I am very excited about the future of TJX. We entered 2016 with terrific momentum, and the year is off to a strong start. We are convinced that we can continue growing our customer base around the world and are pursuing various opportunities to capture market share. 
To support our goals for growth, we are continuing to make strategic investments in the business. I am also confident that we are making the right investments today that will help us grow to $40 billion and beyond. As always, we have a management team that is passionate about achieving its plans and, more importantly, passionate about striving to surpass them. 
Before I continue, I'll now turn the call over to Scott to recap our fourth quarter and full year numbers."

Again, we are thrilled that our 5% consolidated comp increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. It was also great to see that customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase at each of our divisions. We believe we are gaining share profitably across all geographies. As a reminder, our comp sales exclude e-commerce. 
Diluted earnings per share were $3.33, a 5% increase over last year's adjusted $3.16 and exceeded our most recent guidance. It's important to note that our full year EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange, and about 4% due to our wage initiative as well as our incremental investments and pension costs. 
For the full year, consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.8%, down 50 basis points versus last year's adjusted 12.3%. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 30 basis points versus last year, and merchandise margins were also up.  
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.8%, up 70 basis points versus last year's ratio. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. 
Consolidated comps increased 6% over a 4% increase last year and well above our plan. This marks our 28th consecutive quarter of consolidated comp store sales growth. We were very pleased that our fourth quarter comp was also entirely driven by customer traffic. As with the year, traffic was also the primary driver of each division's quarterly comp increase. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.99, a 6% increase over -- versus last year and also well above our plan. It's important to note that our fourth quarter EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange, and about 5% due to our wage initiative as well as incremental investments and pension costs.  
Consolidated pretax profit margins was 11.9%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.7%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was due to an increase in merchandise margin and strong buying and occupancy leverage on the 6% comp. We are very pleased with our gross margin and merchandise margin increases despite the significant negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International, and increased costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.7%, up 100 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to our wage initiative, as we had anticipated, as well as contribution to TJX's charitable foundations, higher incentive compensation accruals due to the company's above-plan performance and increased supply chain costs. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding inventories and -- but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories were up 6% on a constant currency basis. We took advantage of some amazing pack-away opportunities during the fourth quarter and ended the year in an excellent inventory position. 
Now to recap our fourth quarter performance by division. 
Marmaxx finished 2016 with its best quarter of the year. Comps grew by a very strong 6% on top of a very solid 3% increase last year. Once again, it was terrific to see that the comp increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. As we had planned, with our merchandising and value strategies, we saw a significant increase in transactions and units sold, as well as a decrease in average ticket. Apparel, including accessories and home, both had excellent performance, which is nice to see in today's retail environment. 
Segment profit margin was flat as Marmaxx's significant merchant margin increased and buying and occupancy leverage offset the expected impact of our wage initiative, higher supply chain costs and investments in e-commerce. We begin the new year with great momentum at our largest division. 
HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps increased 7% over last year's strong 11% growth, and segment profit margin was up 60 basis points. We are very pleased with HomeGoods' strong increase in merchandise margins. Customers clearly love HomeGoods as we keep growing this premium brand. 
At TJX Canada, comps grew a phenomenal 14% over a strong 7% increase last year. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 140 basis points primarily due to transactional foreign exchange as well as higher incentive compensation accruals due to TJX Canada's above-plan performance. I want to point out that the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had a significant negative impact on this division's merchandise margins. Once again, the efforts that our Canadian organization made to mitigate this currency impact were terrific and highly effective. 
We are very pleased that all 3 teams delivered great performance. 
Now to our businesses beyond North America. These include our European business and Trade Secret in Australia, which together now comprise TJX International. 
TJX International's comp growth was 1% and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 170 basis points. This was primarily due to investments in new countries and transactional foreign exchange as well as some deleverage on the 1% comp. While the fourth quarter was softer than we would have liked, we are pleased with the improving comp trends we are seeing in this business. Further -- and TJX International delivered an excellent year. On our e-commerce sites in the U.S. and U.K., we also offered customers a constant flow of gift giving selections at amazing values throughout the holiday season. We have added thousands of new brands to TJX -- tjmaxx.com since we launched and plan to continue adding new categories and brands to all of our sites. 
Now to our financial strength and shareholder distributions. 
Our business continues to generate excellent cash flows and strong financial returns. In fiscal '16, free cash flow was $2 billion and ROIC was a strong 22%, one of the highest we have seen in retail. This is in -- this is thanks in large part due to our disciplined approach to capital allocation. As always, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs while simultaneously reinvesting in the business for the near and long term. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our first quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."

First, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights from the fourth quarter. Again, we were thrilled to end 2015 with such a strong finish. Customer response to our exciting assortments and great values was terrific this holiday selling seas",1886,"Thanks, Scott. First, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights from the fourth quarter. 
Again, we were thrilled to end 2015 with such a strong finish. Customer response to our exciting assortments and great values was terrific this holiday selling season as well as during the post-holiday period. Every year, we work to improve over the year before. I believe that our marketing, in-store initiatives, gift giving and constant freshness were even better than last year and truly set us apart from other retailers. We believe this drove new shoppers to our stores and encouraged more frequent shopping trips. Also, we liked how we've transitioned our stores after the holidays with our stores looking extremely fresh. 
Now I'd like to talk about the major strengths that differentiate TJX from so many other retailers. 
We're convinced that the same elements of our business that differentiate us from other retailers are also key to our continued successful global growth. Further, we believe these elements would be extremely difficult for others to replicate. 
First, we have a world-class global buying organization that I believe is the best in retail. There are over 1,000 people in our buying organization. And our total merchandising organization, which includes our plan and allocation group, is nearly double that size. Our buyers are located in 11 countries across 4 continents, and we source from a universe that now numbers more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. This is why we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Many in our merchandising organization have been with us for multiple decades, and we have dedicated nearly 40  years to cultivate the talent and off-price expertise of our teams as well as improving our buying processes. Further, we take enormous pride in our strong corporate culture, which I am convinced is a key factor in our recruiting and retaining top talent. 
Second, our global supply chain and distribution network have been developed and refined over nearly 4 years to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. There is no off-the-shelf off-price inventory management software to support a global business model like ours, which is why our proprietary IT systems are designed specifically to handle our off-price buying. Our distribution network can process buys as small as 100 units to over 1 million units from any one of our thousands of vendors in a timely and efficient manner, then allocate that merchandise to the right stores at the right time. We continue to invest in our supply chain ahead of our store growth to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to support new stores, new chains and new countries. 
Third, we are capitalizing on our global presence. TJX is the only major international off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the world. We are one of the few major U.S. retailers to have expanded successfully internationally. We're the largest off-price retailer in the U.S. and Canada and remain the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Europe and Australia. We operate highly integrated and synergistic businesses across many geographies and have built global teams and international infrastructures over many decades. We see our international depth and expertise as a major advantage as we continue to expand our value concept around the world. 
These key strengths allow TJX to be one of the most flexible retailers in the world. Our best-in-class buying organization, combined with our vast vendor universe, allow us to be nimble in the marketplace and capitalize on the best opportunities. The flexibility of our stores and distribution network allow us to respond quickly to changing customer preferences and trends across many different retail and consumer environments around the world. Further, while we offer consumers many different chains and merchandise categories, each of our 4 major divisions operate on the same off-price business model. We function as one TJX and leverage talent, infrastructure, ideas and expertise across the chains. This is an important advantage when opening new stores, launching new chains, entering new markets or tapping new seeds. All of these factors give us great confidence that we can continue our successful, profitable global growth. 
Further, I believe that it is often underestimated how difficult it would be for other retailers to try and replicate these strengths. These key advantages also underscore our confidence and our ability to gain market share profitably and achieve our long-term goals for growth. 
Let me take a moment to review our major growth drivers, and there are really 
3. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We were very pleased with our traffic into all divisions in 2015, yet we are convinced that significant opportunity remains to gain market share. We reach an extremely wide demographic and we like the growth in our customer base across all ages, particularly millennials, across all of our divisions. 
To attract more new customers, we will continue to leverage our global marketing capabilities. During the holiday season, we again leveraged our tri-branded campaigns across the U.S. and Canada and believe that they help drive more customers to our stores. In 2016, we are strategically shifting our marketing dollars to spend more in certain markets and geographies to capitalize on our biggest opportunities. We are continuing our integrated marketing approach to engage with shoppers of all ages through television, radio, digital, mobile and social media. 
To encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of our brands, we are growing our successful loyalty programs in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We also continue to upgrade the shopping experience and plan to remodel about 240 stores across the company in 2016. We are pleased to see our overall customer satisfaction scores increase in 2015 but still see room to become even better on this front. 
We are confident our wage initiative will help us attract and retain talented store associates. I should note that while we are always working on improving efficiencies in our business, we haven't taken any customer-facing actions that would diminish the pleasant shopping experience that we want ensure for our customers. Importantly, we see e-commerce as another great way to drive customer traffic, both online and to our other stores -- to our stores. 
Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. As I just discussed, our ability to leverage our global teams, infrastructure and operational expertise are major reasons for our confidence in being able to continue to open stores profitably around the world. With over 3,600 stores today, we see the potential to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. To be clear, this reflects the potential we see with our existing chains in our existing countries alone. But beyond this, we believe huge opportunity remains. In North America, we see the potential to add over 1,400 stores. In the U.S., we are far from finished growing our largest, most profitable division. Marmaxx is nearly a $20 billion business and T.J. Maxx and Marshalls each have more than 1,000 stores. Yet, we are confident meaningful opportunity remains to continue growing both chains. Long term, we see Marmaxx growing to approximately 3,000 stores. 
At HomeGoods, plenty of whitespace remains across the U.S. We see this chain expanding to at least 1,000 stores, almost double its existing base. And in Canada, our long-term target is about 500 stores. In Europe, we see the long-term potential to expand to 975 stores, almost double our current base. This reflects the potential we see for T.K. Maxx in our current geographies alone and HomeSense in the U.K. And this is before we consider the growth prospects we see in other countries. We are pleased with our launches in Austria and in the Netherlands, which underscored our confidence entering into Australia. 
We see the potential to develop Trade Secret in Australia as similar to how we grew our Canadian business from a 5 store chain to that country's leading off-price retailer. Australia has a population about 2/3 the size of Canada's with similar customer demographics. This underscores our confidence in our ability to grow Trade Secret to be at least a 124 --  125-store chain. Clearly, this number could be conservative and reflects just the potential we see in the early days of owning this business. 
Before I wrap up on store growth, I want to say that we are extremely pleased to have grown our store base by 185 stores for a strong 5% in fiscal 2016. In addition to being at the upper end of our 4% to 5% range for the last several years, we plan to continue with this pace in fiscal 2017. 
It also feels great to say that even in today's volatile retail environment, we closed only one store last year. That's on a store base of over 3,600 stores. All of this speaks to the fundamental strength of our business, our disciplined approach to real estate and our decades of operating expertise in the U.S. and internationally. I should note that while we are opportunistic in our real estate strategies as well and see volatility in the marketplace as an advantage for our business. 
The third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We are constantly testing new seeds and ideas across the company that can reap tremendous benefits for the future. We are very happy with the early read in our new Sierra Trading Post stores and we would be thrilled for STP to eventually become a fourth major chain in the U.S. and Canada. Also, our successful expansion of T.K. Maxx into  Austria and The Netherlands further demonstrates that our value proposition can work in many other European markets. 
Okay, I'll wrap up with our outlook for 2016. 
We are delighted with the great momentum in the business and our healthy start to the year. Our business is very strong, and we have many initiatives under way to drive sales and traffic. Our plans for earnings per share growth this year reflect the expected negative impact with foreign currency and our wage initiative. In addition, investing in initiatives to gain market share and to strengthen our leadership positions around the world remains a top priority. We are committed to carefully balancing our growth in investments, and we remain disciplined in our approach. In 2016, we plan to continue investing in our stores, talent, supply chain, IT and new seeds. Our strategy is to invest ahead of our growth, and we are confident that we are making the right investments today that will give us a strong foundation for the future. Importantly, we are investing in initiatives in which we have decades of knowledge and expertise. All of this gives us great confidence that our investment strategies will be successful. 
We see many exciting opportunities to expand TJX both domestically and internationally. We are confident that these investments we are making today will strongly position us to reach the next level of growth. As always, we are laser focused on beating our plans. 
I could not be more excited about the future of TJX. This is a great company, and I am confident we will continue to deliver successful growth for many years to come.

Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."
306688,325258238,939570,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie. Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.38, which would be down 1% to up 2% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As Ernie mentioned, similar to last year, in fiscal '",1083,"Thanks, Ernie. Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. 
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.38, which would be down 1% to up 2% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As Ernie mentioned, similar to last year, in fiscal '17, we are planning our earnings per share to reflect the negative impact from a couple of factors: First, similar to last year, we expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to negatively impact fiscal '17 EPS growth by approximately 4%. Again this year, it's primarily the result of the dramatic decline in the Canadian dollar and British pound rates versus the prior year. Of course, it's important to remember that FX could moderate or benefit us in the future. Secondly, as we detailed on our third quarter earnings call, we are assuming that our wage initiative will have a negative impact of about 4% to fiscal '17 EPS growth. As always, we are extremely focused on controlling cost and striving to succeed in our plans. 
Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $32.2 billion to $32.5 billion range, a 4% to 5% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. We are assuming a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis. 
We expect pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.9% to 11.1% versus 11.8% in fiscal '16. We're planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.3% to 28.5% versus 28.8% last year. In terms of the pressure we see currency having on our mark on [ph] and merchandise margins at TJX Canada and TJX International, we expect the negative impact to be even larger than last year. Excluding the currency headwind, we would expect the consolidated underlying merchandise margin to be flat to slightly up this year versus last year. We're planning SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.2% to 17.3% versus 16.8% last year primarily due to our wage initiative. 
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.2%; net interest expense of about $54 million; and a weighted average share count of approximately 662 million. 
Now to our full year guidance by division. 
At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $20.5 billion to $20.7 billion, and segment profit margin in the range of 13.6% to 13.8%. As a reminder, in fiscal '17, we are planning Marmaxx's average ticket lower in the first half of the year and essentially flat for the second half. 
At HomeGoods, we expect comp increases -- comps to increase 3% to 4% on sales of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, and segment profit margin to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%. 
For TJX Canada, we are planning a comp increase of 3% to 4% on sales of $2.9 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 12.1% to 12.3%. 
At TJX International, we're expecting a comp increase of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.6 billion, and adjusted pretax margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.6% to 5.8%. 
Now to Q1 guidance. 
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70 versus last year's $0.69 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of approximately 2% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 3% due to our wage initiative. 
We're modeling first quarter consolidated sales in the $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion range. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. 
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. 
First quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.2% to 10.4% versus 11.1% the prior year. We're anticipating first quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.2%  to 28.3%, flat to down 10 basis points versus the prior year. 
We're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the 17.8% to 17.9% range versus 17.0% last year. 
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4%, net interest expense of about $13 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 669 million. 
It's important to remember that our guidance for the first quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the first quarter. 
Moving to our store growth plan for fiscal '17. We plan to add approximately 195 new stores, which would bring our year-end total to about 3,809 stores. This represents store growth of approximately 5% and is at the upper end of our range for the last several years. I want to point out that our plans this year assume no store closings across our entire global store base. 
Beginning with the U.S., our plans calls for us to open about 60 additional stores at Marmaxx and 50 more stores at HomeGoods. We also plan to open about 5 additional Sierra Trading Post stores this year. 
In Canada, we plan to add about 30 new stores. This reflects the opportunities we see to further expand Winners into rural markets as well as our nationwide opportunities for Marshalls. 
In Europe, we plan to continue our significant pace of store growth, opening approximately 50 stores this year. This includes our plans to continue expanding into Austria and The Netherlands. 
I'll wrap up with our financial strength and stability, which clearly gives us tremendous confidence. 
In fiscal '17, we plan to continue our balanced approach to the use of cash. With our increased investments to gain share and support our growth initiatives, we're planning for capital spending to increase to approximately $1.1 billion. 
In fiscal '17, we expect that the Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 24% on top of our 20% increase last year. This would mark our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. We're planning to buy back $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of TJX stock. 
Even with this level of shareholder distributions, we still plan to end fiscal '17 with $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, which points to our significant financial flexibility.

The rest of that is just, again, the drop-off of the currency that we've seen in both the British pound and Canadian dollar. And unfortunately or fortunately for us, most of our purchases have not been made, so they're going to be subject now to this lower Canadian dollar. If we had bought out like other chains, you would probably have less of an impact. But with the big drop-off, you're still going to have a drop-off that at this point is a bit more than last year.

So we're on this mission to continue to offer the outrageous value and not being the first one to try to up the retail. So we've been successful of recent by ensuring our value was the sharpest out there. So we do not want to mess with that. And even though we're getting hit on the buying of the goods in U.S. dollars with the Canadian dollar translation, we still haven't moved our values, and it's -- I believe if you look at our Canadian comps, it's helping us gain significant market share actually in that market.

And we like what we're hitting out there with -- for this first quarter coming up. Our loyalty programs have been strong. So also very happy with that. I would tell you one of the key drivers, though, still, especially in a business like ours, which has so much traffic and frequency of shopping, is that we've been executing on the model, which is to deliver great goods at exciting values. And we've been going after clearly these brands and quality and fashion at retails that, in some cases, are obviously lower. That's a piece of why the average ticket had dropped. So to your question there. By the way, your other part of your question with the average ticket drop, we've had a little bit of it in the other divisions, but Marmaxx has really been more so the division that has experienced more. But it's not as big a swing in other places in the corporation. But the traffic, we've been happy with it because we feel like we're working on all fronts. And even at this point in time, the amount of branded pack-away opportunities that have existed out there has really allowed us to position ourselves going into the New Year, we think, can continue to help with the traffic pull."

On the prior -- or on the investing, first of all, we do what we think makes sense in each area. Clearly, we look at each independent like international, where we look at there versus systems versus e-commerce. We look at our strategy independently of each and decide what do we think is the right long term and the appropriate amount. So I'd tell you on our e-commerce business, and we've discussed this before, it's a relatively small piece of our business, and we are taking approach there of investing in a very methodical way and a careful way. Having said that, we're very happy with the business, where it is today. We just will -- we will keep that in ratio to the benefit and where we think we are headed with that. Systems, there's certainly a maintenance side to that and a part of running the business that we are cognizant of. And in international, clearly you can tell from what we talked about in the script, that is a key focus for us, and we have shown to make our model work whenever we replicate our model wherever we go. In fact, as I believe I mentioned in Australia, we are pretty happy with our early indicators there going in fairly recently and already experiencing, I think, some pretty good success. So I think we can't give you specifics by the different investments. We would tell they're all long term oriented and they're all doing what makes sense for the business. In terms of color post holiday, also, as we mentioned, we're feeling very bullish, I would say, starting the New Year off strong. And that's across many categories. Yes, there are plentiful opportunities in the market, as we talked about going back at the last 2 quarter calls. I think Carol and I both discussed that with you in the last 2 quarters. But nothing has really changed in the environment out there. In fact, there just continues to be a lot of opportunities. If anything, we are at one of those high points of taking advantage of pack-aways but still having to control our merchants to make sure that we don't buy too much actually because there's so much to choose from. So we're feeling really, really strong about the positioning post holiday. The liquidity is in a good position. That is feeling healthy. And I guess that's that. And I will ask Scott to jump on in the SG&A."

The past -- last year and, I would say, still certainly with the wage piece and a little bit with the average ticket, the incremental cost, obviously, are weighing on you because the wage increases and with the average retail do, are mitigating a bit of what that would be on your flow-through. So a solid 3%, excluding what would be the, I would just say, the wage increase."

It's -- which, by the way, is a great question because we -- one of the benefits we've liked about it is we have been able to bob and weave, so to speak, the way you have just described it. So we're able to take things that are a little out of season here and go there. We're at the -- now you have to keep in mind we're dealing with 35 stores versus billions, right? So it's not a major swing impact for, like, the Marmaxx guys or the home business here, but there is a strong benefit for that new Australian business for Trade Secret because they're able to take advantage, to your point, of the off-season goods. It becomes not a pack-away, it becomes an in-season use there. And there's going to be some benefit additionally in terms of reading some trends on a certain fashion item that we'll be able to go ahead of it there like we're able to do with our down sales stores here as well. But even there, a little earlier, that will give us some reads actually of some fashion items ahead of the curve so we can maybe take advantage of that back here. So a great question, yes. And we're happy. Again, as I said before, very happy with -- we have -- what we've already done with that, and we have some great people working there. We have one, a senior executive that, I think we talked about this before from our Canada division, that has relocated there, as well as a handful of other TJX associates. So we are really TJX-sizing that business rather quickly. And already, and you guys are familiar with how we pride ourselves on turning fast to create the treasure hunt, that division is already turning significantly, significantly faster than it did last year with a huge reduction in inventory. So all good signs. And I think if the subject you bought up about the way we're buying would just help that, that will be another benefit in the future."

I think in the environment that we're in right now, by the way, I think the value off-price business still plays better. And some of the results that come out there, I think that will validate that. The reason we -- but if you look actually -- if you look at our store growth that we've laid out, that tells you how bullish we are. And then if you look at, I think, some of the other reports that have been out recently over the last couple of months on other types of retail that do not have store growth, going the other way, so to speak, I think that would tell you that we believe the off-price is the big opportunity. And we just never -- sometimes there's a concern there's going to be a lack of goods as we continue to -- growing out all these stores. It just -- as you know, I think I said it like 20 minutes ago, we actually have to hold the merchants back still. There are so much goods out there. We've never not had it be that way. It goes in waves, sometimes a little more than others. Yes, right now, it is a little bit more of that move, but even when it cuts back a little, there's still more goods than we can take in. So we're just bullish on this model. We can't speak to -- I really and nor can the team speak to really any other retail model as well as we can on this one, but we're very comfortable and confident where the potential lies in TJX and growth here."

The first one is clearly the foreign exchange issue has been in flux, by the way. Some day, that could go the other way and actually benefit us.

We expect it, by the way, in FY '18 to go back to '16 levels, but it's still significant. And the other, again, unknown there or a bit in flux is that we could be further impacted if additional cities, states or countries increase their minimum wage. So that, again, hits us there potentially, but we don't know by how much. And then lastly, we have our investments to fuel our future growth, and these investments, by the way, as I said before, these are the right things to do.

Consumers are loving our stores and shopping us even more frequently. We are convinced we are gaining market share profitably around the world. 
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 5%, also above our expectations and over a strong 12% increase the prior year. 2015 marks the 20th consecutive year of comp and EPS gains for TJX. In our 39-year history, we have seen only one comp store sales decline. 
We're also very pleased that we drove merchandise margin increases while offering even more amazing values to our customers. It's important to note that we achieved these results despite significant foreign currency headwinds as well as reinvesting in the business. 
Further, we were thrilled that our momentum continued into the fourth quarter. We ended the year with fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our plans. It's also great to see such consistency in our business, with comps hitting 5% to 6% every quarter of the year. 
Our 2015 performance once again demonstrates the power of our differentiated, flexible business model to succeed across many different geographic, economic and retail environments.  We were thrilled to expand our global footprint into Austria, the Netherlands and Australia in 2015. So now we operate in 9 countries across 3 continents. 
Looking ahead, I am very excited about the future of TJX. We entered 2016 with terrific momentum, and the year is off to a strong start. We are convinced that we can continue growing our customer base around the world and are pursuing various opportunities to capture market share. 
To support our goals for growth, we are continuing to make strategic investments in the business. I am also confident that we are making the right investments today that will help us grow to $40 billion and beyond. As always, we have a management team that is passionate about achieving its plans and, more importantly, passionate about striving to surpass them.

It's important to note that our full year EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange, and about 4% due to our wage initiative as well as incremental investments and pension costs. 
For the full year, consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.8%, down 50 basis points versus last year's adjusted 12.3%. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 30 basis points versus last year, and merchandise margins were also up.  
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.8%, up 70 basis points versus last year's ratio. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. 
Consolidated comps increased 6% over a 4% increase last year and well above our plan. This marks our 28th consecutive quarter of consolidated comp store sales growth. We were very pleased that our fourth quarter comp was also entirely driven by customer traffic. As with the year, traffic was also the primary driver of each division's quarterly comp increase. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.99, a 6% increase over -- versus last year and also well above our plan. It's important to note that our fourth quarter EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange, and about 5% due to our wage initiative as well as incremental investments and pension costs.  
Consolidated pretax profit margins was 11.9%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.7%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was due to an increase in merchandise margin and strong buying and occupancy leverage on the 6% comp. We are very pleased with our gross margin and merchandise margin increases despite the significant negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International, and increased costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 16.7%, up 100 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to our wage initiative, as we had anticipated, as well as contribution to TJX's charitable foundations, higher incentive compensation accruals due to the company's above-plan performance and increased supply chain costs. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding inventories and -- but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 6% on a constant currency basis. We took advantage of some amazing pack-away opportunities during the fourth quarter and ended the year in an excellent inventory position. 
Now to recap our fourth quarter performance by division. 
Marmaxx finished 2016 with its best quarter of the year. Comps grew by a very strong 6% on top of a very solid 3% increase last year. Once again, it was terrific to see that the comp increase was entirely driven by customer traffic. As we had planned, with our merchandising and value strategies, we saw a significant increase in transactions and units sold, as well as a decrease in average ticket. Apparel, including accessories and home, both had excellent performance, which is nice to see in today's retail environment. 
Segment profit margin was flat, as Marmaxx's significant merchant margin increase and buying and occupancy leverage offset the expected impact of our wage initiative, higher supply chain costs and investments in e-commerce. We begin the new year with great momentum at our largest division. 
HomeGoods delivered another outstanding quarter. Comps increased 7% over last year's strong 11% growth, and segment profit margin was up 60 basis points. We are very pleased with HomeGoods' strong increase in merchandise margins. Customers clearly love HomeGoods as we keep growing this premium brand. 
At TJX Canada, comps grew a phenomenal 14% over a strong 7% increase last year. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 140 basis points, primarily due to transactional foreign exchange as well as higher incentive compensation accruals due to TJX Canada's above-plan performance. I want to point out that the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had a significant negative impact on this division's merchandise margins. Once again, the efforts that our Canadian organization made to mitigate this currency impact were terrific and highly effective. 
We are very pleased that all 3 teams delivered great performance. 
Now to our businesses beyond North America. These include our European business and Trade Secret in Australia, which together now comprise TJX International. 
TJX International's comp growth was 1% and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, decreased 170 basis points. This was primarily due to investments in new countries and transactional foreign exchange as well as some deleverage on the 1% comp. While the fourth quarter was softer than we would have liked, we are pleased with the improving comp trends we are seeing in this business. Further -- and TJX International delivered an excellent year. On our e-commerce sites in the U.S. and U.K., we also offered customers a constant flow of gift-giving selections at amazing values throughout the holiday season. We have added thousands of new brands to TJX -- tjmaxx.com since we launched and plan to continue adding new categories and brands to all of our sites. 
Now to our financial strength and shareholder distributions. 
Our business continues to generate excellent cash flows and strong financial returns. In fiscal '16, free cash flow was $2 billion and ROIC was a strong 22%, one of the highest we have seen in retail. This is in -- this is thanks in large part due to our disciplined approach to capital allocation. As always, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs while simultaneously reinvesting in the business for the near and long term. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our first quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."

First, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights from the fourth quarter. Again, we were thrilled to end 2015 with such a strong finish. Customer response to our exciting assortments and great values was terrific this holiday selling seas",1885,"Thanks, Scott. First, I'd like to briefly cover some highlights from the fourth quarter. 
Again, we were thrilled to end 2015 with such a strong finish. Customer response to our exciting assortments and great values was terrific this holiday selling season as well as during the post-holiday period. Every year, we work to improve over the year before. I believe that our marketing, in-store initiatives, gift giving and constant freshness were even better than last year and truly set us apart from other retailers. We believe this drove new shoppers to our stores and encouraged more frequent shopping trips. Also, we liked how we've transitioned our stores after the holidays, with our stores looking extremely fresh. 
Now I'd like to talk about the major strengths that differentiate TJX from so many other retailers. 
We're convinced that the same elements of our business that differentiate us from other retailers are also key to our continued successful global growth. Further, we believe these elements would be extremely difficult for others to replicate. 
First, we have a world-class global buying organization that I believe is the best in retail. There are over 1,000 people in our buying organization. And our total merchandising organization, which includes our plan and allocation group, is nearly double that size. Our buyers are located in 11 countries across 4 continents, and we source from a universe that now numbers more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. This is why we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Many in our merchandising organization have been with us for multiple decades, and we have dedicated nearly 40 years to cultivating the talent and off-price expertise of our teams as well as improving our buying processes. Further, we take enormous pride in our strong corporate culture, which I am convinced is a key factor in our recruiting and retaining top talent. 
Second, our global supply chain and distribution network have been developed and refined over nearly 4 years to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. There is no off-the-shelf off-price inventory management software to support a global business model like ours, which is why our proprietary IT systems are designed specifically to handle our off-price buying. Our distribution network can process buys as small as 100 units to over 1 million units, from any one of our thousands of vendors, in a timely and efficient manner, and then allocate that merchandise to the right stores at the right time. We continue to invest in our supply chain ahead of our store growth to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to support new stores, new chains and new countries. 
Third, we are capitalizing on our global presence. TJX is the only major international off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the world. We are one of the few major U.S. retailers to have expanded successfully internationally. We're the largest off-price retailer in the U.S. and Canada, and remain the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Europe and Australia. We operate highly integrated and synergistic businesses across many geographies and have built global teams and international infrastructures over many decades. We see our international depth and expertise as a major advantage as we continue to expand our value concept around the world. 
These key strengths allow TJX to be one of the most flexible retailers in the world. Our best-in-class buying organization, combined with our vast vendor universe, allow us to be nimble in the marketplace and capitalize on the best opportunities. The flexibility of our stores and distribution network allow us to respond quickly to changing customer preferences and trends across many different retail and consumer environments around the world. Further, while we offer consumers many different chains and merchandise categories, each of our 4 major divisions operate on the same off-price business model. We function as one TJX and leverage talent, infrastructure, ideas and expertise across the chains. This is an important advantage when opening new stores, launching new chains, entering new markets or testing new seeds. All of these factors give us great confidence that we can continue our successful, profitable global growth. 
Further, I believe that it is often underestimated how difficult it would be for other retailers to try and replicate these strengths. These key advantages also underscore our confidence in our ability to gain market share profitably and achieve our long-term goals for growth. 
Let me take a moment to review our major growth drivers, and there are really 
3. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We were very pleased with our traffic into all divisions in 2015, yet we are convinced that a significant opportunity remains to gain market share. We reach an extremely wide demographic and we like the growth in our customer base across all ages, particularly millennials, across all of our divisions. 
To attract more new customers, we will continue to leverage our global marketing capabilities. During the holiday season, we again leveraged our tri-branded campaigns across the U.S. and Canada and believe that they help drive more customers to our stores. In 2016, we are strategically shifting our marketing dollars to spend more in certain markets and geographies to capitalize on our biggest opportunities. We are continuing our integrated marketing approach to engage with shoppers of all ages through television, radio, digital, mobile and social media. 
To encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of our brands, we are growing our successful loyalty programs in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We also continue to upgrade the shopping experience and plan to remodel about 240 stores across the company in 2016. We are pleased to see our overall customer satisfaction scores increase in 2015, but still see room to become even better on this front. 
We are confident our wage initiative will help us attract and retain talented store associates. I should note that while we are always working on improving efficiencies in our business, we haven't taken any customer-facing actions that would diminish the pleasant shopping experience that we want ensure for our consumers. Importantly, we see e-commerce as another great way to drive customer traffic, both online and to our other stores -- to our stores. 
Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. As I just discussed, our ability to leverage our global teams, infrastructure and operational expertise are major reasons for our confidence in being able to continue to open stores profitably around the world. With over 3,600 stores today, we see the potential to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. To be clear, this reflects the potential we see with our existing chains in our existing countries alone. But beyond this, we believe huge opportunity remains. In North America, we see the potential to add over 1,400 stores. In the U.S., we are far from finished growing our largest, most profitable division. Marmaxx is nearly a $20 billion business and T.J. Maxx and Marshalls each have more than 1,000 stores. Yet, we are confident meaningful opportunity remains to continue growing both chains. Long term, we see Marmaxx growing to approximately 3,000 stores. 
At HomeGoods, plenty of whitespace remains across the U.S. We see this chain expanding to at least 1,000 stores, almost double its existing base. And in Canada, our long-term target is about 500 stores. In Europe, we see the long-term potential to expand to 975 stores, almost double our current base. This reflects the potential we see for T.K. Maxx in our current geographies alone, and HomeSense in the U.K. And this is before we consider the growth prospects we see in other countries. We are pleased with our launches in Austria and in the Netherlands, which underscored our confidence entering into Australia. 
We see the potential to develop Trade Secret in Australia as similar to how we grew our Canadian business from a 5-store chain to that country's leading off-price retailer. Australia has a population about 2/3 the size of Canada's with similar customer demographics. This underscores our confidence in our ability to grow Trade Secret to be at least a 124 -- 125-store chain. Clearly, this number could be conservative and reflects just the potential we see in the early days of owning this business. 
Before I wrap up on store growth, I want to say that we are extremely pleased to have grown our store base by 185 stores for a strong 5% in fiscal 2016. In addition to being at the upper end of our 4% to 5% range for the last several years, we plan to continue with this pace in fiscal 2017. 
It also feels great to say that even in today's volatile retail environment, we closed only one store last year. That's on a store base of over 3,600 stores. All of this speaks to the fundamental strength of our business, our disciplined approach to real estate and our decades of operating expertise in the U.S. and internationally. I should note that while we are opportunistic in our real estate strategies as well and see volatility in the marketplace as an advantage for our business. 
The third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We are constantly testing new seeds and ideas across the company that can reap tremendous benefits for the future. We are very happy with the early read in our new Sierra Trading Post stores and we would be thrilled for STP to eventually become a fourth major chain in the U.S. and Canada. Also, our successful expansion of T.K. Maxx into Austria and The Netherlands further demonstrates that our value proposition can work in many other European markets. 
Okay, I'll wrap up with our outlook for 2016. 
We are delighted with the great momentum in the business and our healthy start to the year. Our business is very strong, and we have many initiatives underway to drive sales and traffic. Our plans for earnings per share growth this year reflect the expected negative impact with foreign currency and our wage initiative. In addition, investing in initiatives to gain market share and to strengthen our leadership positions around the world remains a top priority. We are committed to carefully balancing our growth and investments, and we remain disciplined in our approach. In 2016, we plan to continue investing in our stores, talent, supply chain, IT and new seeds. Our strategy is to invest ahead of our growth, and we are confident that we are making the right investments today that will give us a strong foundation for the future. Importantly, we are investing in initiatives in which we have decades of knowledge and expertise. All of this gives us great confidence that our investment strategies will be successful. 
We see many exciting opportunities to expand TJX, both domestically and internationally. We are confident that these investments we are making today will strongly position us to reach the next level of growth. As always, we are laser focused on beating our plans. 
I could not be more excited about the future of TJX. This is a great company, and I am confident we will continue to deliver successful growth for many years to come. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."
306688,325258238,939718,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie. Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.38, which would be down 1% to up 2% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As Ernie mentioned, similar to last year, in fiscal '",1082,"Thanks, Ernie. Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. 
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.38, which would be down 1% to up 2% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As Ernie mentioned, similar to last year, in fiscal '17, we are planning our earnings per share to reflect the negative impact from a couple of factors. First, similar to last year, we expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to negatively impact fiscal '17 EPS growth by approximately 4%. Again this year, it's primarily the result of the dramatic decline in the Canadian dollar and British pound rates versus the prior year. Of course, it's important to remember that FX could moderate or benefit us in the future. Secondly, as we detailed on our third quarter earnings call, we are assuming that our wage initiative will have a negative impact of about 4% to fiscal '17 EPS growth. As always, we are extremely focused on controlling cost and striving to succeed in our plans. 
Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $32.2 billion to $32.5 billion range, a 4% to 5% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. We are assuming a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis. 
We expect pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.9% to 11.1% versus 11.8% in fiscal '16. We're planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.3% to 28.5% versus 28.8% last year. In terms of the pressure we see currency having on our mark-on and merchandise margins at TJX Canada and TJX International, we expect the negative impact to be even larger than last year. Excluding the currency headwind, we would expect the consolidated underlying merchandise margin to be flat to slightly up this year versus last year. We're planning SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.2% to 17.3% versus 16.8% last year, primarily due to our wage initiative. 
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.2%, net interest expense of about $54 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 662 million. 
Now to our full year guidance by division. 
At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $20.5 billion to $20.7 billion, and segment profit margin in the range of 13.6% to 13.8%. As a reminder, in fiscal '17, we are planning Marmaxx's average ticket lower in the first half of the year and essentially flat for the second half. 
At HomeGoods, we expect comp increases -- comps to increase 3% to 4% on sales of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, and segment profit margin to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%. 
For TJX Canada, we are planning a comp increase of 3% to 4% on sales of $2.9 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 12.1% to 12.3%. 
At TJX International, we're expecting a comp increase of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.6 billion, and adjusted pretax margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.6% to 5.8%. 
Now to Q1 guidance. 
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70 versus last year's $0.69 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of approximately 2% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 3% due to our wage initiative. 
We're modeling first quarter consolidated sales in the $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion range. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to reported revenue due to translational FX. 
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. 
First quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.2% to 10.4% range versus 11.1% the prior year. We're anticipating first quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.2% to 28.3%, flat to down 10 basis points versus the prior year. 
We're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the 17.8% to 17.9% range versus 17.0% last year. 
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4%, net interest expense of about $13 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 669 million. 
It's important to remember that our guidance for the first quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the first quarter. 
Moving to our store growth plans for fiscal '17. We plan to add approximately 195 new stores, which would bring our year-end total to about 3,809 stores. This represents store growth of approximately 5% and is at the upper end of our range for the last several years. I want to point out that our plans this year assume no store closings across our entire global store base. 
Beginning with the U.S., our plans calls for us to open about 60 additional stores at Marmaxx and 50 more stores at HomeGoods. We also plan to open about 5 additional Sierra Trading Post stores this year. 
In Canada, we plan to add about 30 new stores. This reflects the opportunities we see to further expand Winners into rural markets, as well as our nationwide opportunities for Marshalls. 
In Europe, we plan to continue our significant pace of store growth, opening approximately 50 stores this year. This includes our plans to continue expanding into Austria and The Netherlands. 
I'll wrap up with our financial strength and stability, which clearly gives us tremendous confidence. 
In fiscal '17, we plan to continue our balanced approach to the use of cash. With our increased investments to gain share and support our growth initiatives, we're planning for capital spending to increase to approximately $1.1 billion. 
In fiscal '17, we expect that the Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 24% on top of our 20% increase last year. This would mark our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. We're planning to buy back $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of TJX stock. 
Even with this level of shareholder distributions, we still plan to end fiscal '17 with $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, which points to our significant financial flexibility.

The rest of that is just, again, the drop-off of the currency that we've seen in both the British pound and Canadian dollar. And unfortunately, or fortunately for us, most of our purchases have not been made, so they're going to be subject now to this lower Canadian dollar. If we had bought out like other chains, you would probably have less of an impact. But with the big drop-off, you're still going to have a drop-off that at this point is a bit more than last year.

In terms of the traffic, first of all, there are a lot of levers being pulled, just as you mentioned, marketing -- it's never one thing. Obviously, we won't give any specific breakdowns on it, but marketing is a play. We've been very happy, as you can see, and you witnessed some of it, I'm sure, some of the creative we've had out there like our tri-brand campaign at holiday. And we like what we're hitting out there with -- for this first quarter coming up. Our loyalty programs have been strong. So also very happy with that. I would tell you one of the key drivers, though, still, especially in a business like ours, which has so much traffic and frequency of shopping, is that we've been executing on the model, which is to deliver great goods at exciting values. And we've been going after, clearly, these brands and quality and fashion at retails that, in some cases, are obviously lower. That's a piece of why the average ticket had dropped. So to your question there. By the way, your other part of your question with the average ticket drop, we've had a little bit of it in the other divisions, but Marmaxx has really been more so the division that has experienced more of it. It's not as big a swing in other places in the corporation. But the traffic, we've been happy with it because we feel like we're working on all fronts. And even at this point in time, the amount of branded pack-away opportunities that have existed out there has really allowed us to position ourselves going into the new year, we think, to continue to help with the traffic pull."

The other piece, frankly, relates to we did not plan, going back a few years ago, the 7% to 8% comps that we've experienced at HomeGoods, nor the double-digit comp increase that we've had at Canada, thereby necessitating really more of a timing, moving forward some of the needs for our supply chain infrastructure, and even a little bit of that at Marmaxx given the lower average retail. So this is more of a timing over the next year or 2 where we continue to have those incremental costs, and we would see that to moderate over time."

On the prior -- or on the investing, first of all, we do what we think makes sense in each area. Clearly, we look at each independent, like international, where we look at there [ph] versus systems versus e-commerce. We look at our strategy independently of each and decide what do we think is the right long term and the appropriate amount. So I'd tell you on our e-commerce business, and we've discussed this before, it's a relatively small piece of our business, and we are taking approach there of investing in a very methodical way and a careful way. Having said that, we're very happy with the business, where it is today. We just will -- we will keep that in ratio to the benefit and where we think we are headed with that. Systems, there's certainly a maintenance side to that and a part of running the business that we are cognizant of. And in international, clearly you can tell from what we talked about in the script, that is a key focus for us, and we have shown to make our model work whenever we replicate our model, wherever we go. In fact, as I believe I mentioned, in Australia, we are pretty happy with our early indicators there, going in fairly recently and already experiencing, I think, some pretty good success. So I think we can't give you specifics by the different investments. We would tell you they're all long term oriented and they're all doing what makes sense for the business. In terms of color post-holiday, also, as we mentioned, we're feeling very bullish, I would say, starting the new year off strong. And that's across many categories. Yes, there are plentiful opportunities in the market, as we talked about going back at the last 2 quarter calls. I think Carol and I both discussed that with you in the last 2 quarters. But nothing has really changed in the environment out there. In fact, there just continues to be a lot of opportunities. If anything, we are at one of those high points of taking advantage of pack-aways but still having to control our merchants to make sure that we don't buy too much actually, because there's so much to choose from. So we're feeling really, really strong about the positioning post-holiday. The liquidity is in a good position. That is feeling healthy. And I guess that's that. And I will ask Scott to jump on in the SG&A."

I'll just -- for -- I won't give much more color on the investment, but our capital budget increase over last year is pretty similar. When you talk about the new stores, renovations, as Ernie talked about earlier, and the biggest incremental piece of our increase over last year, frankly, relates to timing of some spend between fiscal '16 and fiscal '17 and then, as we talked about, just the cost related to the new distribution centers. Moving to the SG&A. Now the comp breakeven is closer to -- is a solid 3%. It used to be a bit lower, but more having to do with the -- if you -- but this is going back several years, with the significant opportunities that were at that point in terms of cost efficiencies and lower-lying fruit on merchandise inventories as we were bringing down substantially our inventories. The past -- last year and, I would say, still certainly with the wage piece and a little bit with the average ticket, the incremental cost, obviously, are weighing on you because the wage increases and with the average retail do [ph], are mitigating a bit of what that would be on your flow-through. So a solid 3%, excluding what would be the, I would just say, the wage increase."

It's -- which, by the way, is a great question because we -- one of the benefits we've liked about it is we have been able to bob and weave, so to speak, the way you have just described it. So we're able to take things that are a little out of season here and go there with it. Now you have to keep in mind, we're dealing with 35 stores versus billions, right? So it's not a major swing impact for, like, the Marmaxx guys or the home business here, but there is a strong benefit for that new Australian business for Trade Secret because they're able to take advantage, to your point, of the off-season goods. It becomes not a pack-away, it becomes an in-season use there. And there's going to be some benefit additionally in terms of reading some trends on a certain fashion item that we'll be able to go ahead of it there, like we're able to do with our down sales [ph] stores here as well. But even there, a little earlier, that will give us some reads actually of some fashion items ahead of the curve so we can maybe take advantage of that back here. So a great question, yes. And we're happy. Again, as I said before, very happy with -- we have -- what we've already done with that, and we have some great people working there. We have one, a senior executive that, I think we talked about this before from our Canada division, that has relocated there, as well as a handful of other TJX associates. So we are really TJX-izing that business rather quickly. And already -- and you guys are familiar with how we pride ourselves on turning fast to create the treasure hunt. That division is already turning significantly, significantly faster than it did last year with a huge reduction in inventory. So all good signs. And I think if the subject you brought up about the way we'll buy would just help that, that will be another benefit in the future."

The reason we -- but if you look actually -- if you look at our store growth that we've laid out, that tells you how bullish we are. And then if you look at, I think, some of the other reports that have been out recently over the last couple of months on other types of retail that do not have store growth, going the other way, so to speak, I think that would tell you that we believe the off-price is the big opportunity. And we just never -- sometimes there's a concern there's going to be a lack of goods as we continue to -- growing out all these stores. It just -- as you know, I think I said it like 20 minutes ago, we actually have to hold the merchants back still. There are so much goods out there. We've never not had it be that way. It goes in waves, sometimes a little more than others. Yes, right now, it is a little bit more of that mode, but even when it cuts back a little, there's still more goods than we can take in.

We expect it, by the way, in FY '18 to go back to '16 levels, but it's still significant. And the other, again, unknown there or a bit in flux is that we could be further impacted if additional cities, states or countries increase their minimum wage.

And then lastly, we have our investments to fuel our future growth, and these investments, by the way, as I said before, these are the right things to do.

I -- we know that they were pretty heavy in inventory and pretty promotional because of the warm weather earlier in the winter. So did you see that? How did you work against that?

So yes, there's less right now than there was before. However, if you ask me how does it compare this year to last year for department stores, I could not answer that. We try to kind of focus on what we're feeling here. What we feel in general is an environment of, again, a lot of availability of merchandise. And so we don't know where that -- some of it's department stores, some of it's specialty stores, some of it's other types of stores. So that's really our only barometer. In terms of their promotional activity, again, not sure. We do see their ticket actually declining, is our perception. Oh, we see -- I would get -- I would say not declining, but we see their ticket kind of staying in the zone that it's been to last year, kind of very similar. Like, we don't see any major shifts, I guess, in what they're carrying."

Let me first begin by saying that I'm very pleased to start the year off with such a strong first quarter. Our momentum continued with consolidated comp sales up a strong 7%, which was well above our plan and over a 5% increase last year. All 4 of our major divisions delivered strong comps, and again, this quarter, customer traffic was the driver of our comp increase. We were particularly pleased with the strong performance of apparel, including accessories and our home category. Our eclectic merchandise mix, great brands and amazing values clearly continue to resonate with consumers across all of our geographies. We believe our ability to deliver the right fashions at the right values at the right time is key to our success. 
Our first quarter results continue our long track record of achieving comp sales increases in many types of retail environments, economies and geographies. We are convinced that we are growing our customer base and gaining market share. Earnings per share increased a strong 10%, also well above our expectations and over an 8% increase last year. Importantly, we achieved these results while simultaneously investing to support our growth and despite significant headwinds from foreign exchange and wage increases. 
Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a solid start. We see many near- and long-term growth opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, to capture market share. As always, our management team is extremely driven to achieve our plans and we will strive to surpass them. Further, we making strategic investments today to support our growth plans around the world and grow TJX to a $40 billion-plus company. 
Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our first quarter numbers."
306688,333720349,986955,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 17, 2016",2016-05-17,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.

As Ernie mentioned, our first quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 7%, which was well above our plan and marks our 29th consecutive quarter of comp growth. I want to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division. We also saw a strong increase in our units sold again this quarter. As we anticipated, overall average ticket decreased. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.76, a 10% increase over last year's $0.69 and well above our plan. Our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 2% due to wage increases. Consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.9%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was primarily due to buying and occupancy leverage on the 7% comp, partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory hedges. Despite the negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International, merchandise margins remains strong. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, was 17.7%, up 70 basis points versus last year's ratio. This was better than we expected due to expense leverage on the above-plan 7% comp. Wage increases continue to be a significant headwind to SG&A and investments to support our growth also at an unfavorable impact. At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 7% on a constant-currency basis. During the quarter, we took advantage of some great packaway deals. We feel very comfortable with our inventory liquidity as we enter the second quarter. We are well-positioned to capitalize on buying opportunities in a marketplace of quality branded merchandise. 
Now to recap our first quarter performance by division, Marmaxx comps increased a very strong 6% again this quarter on top of last year's 3% increase. We are very pleased that our comp sales increases was entirely driven by customer traffic and we saw significant gains in units sold. Further, the expected decrease in average ticket was less than we planned. Segment profit margin increased 10 basis points, with strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandise margin. As a reminder, wage increases continued to have a significant negative impact to margins. We are very pleased with the continued excellent performance of our largest division. HomeGoods comps increased a very strong 9% over last year's 9% growth. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. We were pleased with our strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases also had a significant negative impact to HomeGoods margins. Again, we are very happy with the traffic and comp increases we continue to see at HomeGoods. The enthusiasm of our HomeGoods customers is hard to beat. At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 14% again this quarter, over last year's 11% increase. Adjusted segment margin, excluding foreign currency, was up 190 basis points due to strong buying and occupancy leverage. The year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar continue to have a significant negative impact on this division's merchandise margins. Our Canadian organization did an excellent job of mitigating some of this currency impact. We are very pleased with the performance across all 3 of our Canadian chains. TJX International's comps were up 4% over a 3% increase last year. We are pleased with the improvement in our comp growth since the fourth quarter. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 60 basis points. The decline was due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business. During the quarter, we opened up our 500th store in Europe, a proud milestone for our business. 
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the first quarter, we bought back 375 million of TJX stock, retiring 5 million shares. We continue to anticipate buying back 1.5 billion to 2 billion of TJX stock this year. In addition we increased the per-share dividend by 24% margin, marking the 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I will recap our second quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,333720349,986955,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 17, 2016",2016-05-17,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Now I'd like to review our major strengths, which differentiate TJX from many other large retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. These elements of our business give us confidence that we will continue gaining market share and growing",1542,"Thanks, Scott. Now I'd like to review our major strengths, which differentiate TJX from many other large retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. These elements of our business give us confidence that we will continue gaining market share and growing our business successfully for many years to come. We also believe this will be extremely difficult for others to replicate. For us, our value proposition always comes first. Since day one of our company, value has been our mission. We define value as a combination of brand, fashion, price and quality, which has resonated with consumers for many years and many types of retail and economic environments across different geographies. We are confident that our focus on the right fashions and brands at compelling off-price values will continue to differentiate TJX. 
Second, we see TJX as a global sourcing machine. We have a world-class global buying organization, with over 1,000 associates located in 11 countries across 4 continents. We are proud of our strong corporate culture and remain dedicated to training and developing our buyers and next generation of leaders. Our vendor universe numbers, more than 18,000 vendors in 100 plus countries, we take pride in our vendor relationships, which we believe are some of the best in retail. With a store base of more than 3,600 stores in 9 countries, we believe we are an attractive and increasingly important outlet for vendors. We buy in many different ways and offer vendors a great deal of flexibility. We are typically willing to purchase less than full assortments of items, styles and sizes and quantities ranging from small to very large. Further, we are straightforward in our dealings and build mutually beneficial relationships for the long term. All of this allows us to offer consumers an extremely eclectic merchandise mix of well-known and emerging brands from all around the world. I am convinced this helps set us apart from most major retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. 
Next, we have a global supply chain and distribution network developed and refined over many decades to specifically support our international off-price model. The flexibility of our network allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores to react to changing market dynamics and capitalize on hot product categories and changing consumer tastes. We operate distribution centers in 6 countries, and we constantly work to improve our ability to flow the right goods to the right stores at the right time. As we continue to grow our store base and plan to enter new countries, we are expanding our supply chain to ramp-up our capacity ahead of our growth. 
Finally, we are leveraging our global presence. We have decades of experience operating internationally and run highly synergistic and integrated retail chains all centered around our value mission. We share initiatives, best practices and talent across our global organization. The depth of our international expertise, teams and infrastructure underscores our confidence and our ability to strengthen our leadership positions around the world and expand successfully into new international markets. 
Now I'd like to recap our growth drivers, which give us confidence in our ability to gain market share for many years to come. Our #1 initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We are very pleased with our comp sales increases and traffic gains at all divisions in the first quarter. We are even more excited about the potential to see -- we see to grow our customer base both in the U.S. and internationally. Our research indicates that our traffic increases are being driven both by new customers and existing customers shopping us more frequently. I believe we become better at leveraging our Global Marketing capabilities every year. We take an integrated marketing approach to engage with shoppers across all age brackets through television, radio, digital, mobile and social media. This year, we are strategically targeting some of our marketing dollars to certain geographies and markets where we see the biggest opportunities. We are very happy with our creative marketing campaigns at every division this spring. 
To encourage more frequent visits and cross shopping of our chains, we are growing our loyalty programs. In an ever-competitive retail environment, we want to make sure that customers have a great experience every time they shop our stores. We are working to upgrade our stores everyday and are on track to remodel about 240 stores across TJX this year. Further, while our customer satisfaction scores increased again this quarter, we still see room to become even better. As to e-commerce, while it's a small part of our business, we see it as highly complementary to our physical stores. We are being methodical in how we grow this business. We view e-commerce as another great avenue for driving traffic, both online and to our stores and growing our retail brands. Most importantly, across our businesses, we remain laser-focused on offering shoppers an always changing mix of exciting merchandising values. We are constantly opening new vendors and offering consumers new brands. 
Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. We are confident that we can continue to open stores around the world and capitalize on first-mover advantages. We have decades of operating expertise in the U.S. and internationally, a disciplined approach to real estate and a highly integrated global supply chain and distribution network. Long term, we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores with just our current change and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 50% store growth or almost 2,000 additional stores on top of our current base. Further, we believe significant opportunity exists beyond this. To reiterate, our estimates do not contemplate the potential to expand into additional countries or open new chains in existing markets. As a reminder, in 2016, we plan to add approximately 195 new stores, an increase of 5%. We also have no store closings planned across our entire company this year. We believe this speaks to the strength of our business, our global operating expertise, and our real estate discipline. In the smaller retail environment, our real estate teams have plenty of open to buy and are opportunistic in seeking the most advantageous deals in the marketplace. 
Our third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We are convinced that our drive to keep innovating and developing new seeds is a major success factor for our company. We are constantly testing new ideas and planting seeds across the company that could be very meaningful to our future growth. This includes entering new countries and testing new concepts. We are pleased with our European expansion into Austria and The Netherlands, as well as the potential we see for our business in Australia, our third continent. We continue to test our Sierra Trading Post stores, and we will be very pleased if we could eventually roll this up as a fourth major U.S. chain. Intelligent risk-taking is part of our DNA, and we have many initiatives up our sleeves. 
To support our near and long term goals for growth, we are making strategic investments in the business. We have many initiatives underway, and many more planned to bring TJX to the next level of growth. We take a disciplined approach and are balancing our growth with investments to strengthen our foundation to support our future plans. As we discussed when we announced our earnings at year-end, we are making significant investments in our business. This includes new stores and remodels, our supply chain and infrastructure, new seeds for growth and developing talent, as well as our previously announced wage increases. We see investing in our associates and preserving our strong corporate culture as imperative to our continued success. Further, we are investing in initiatives that can benefit from our decades of knowledge and expertise in growing a global off-price business. While these investments impact our EPS growth, we are confident that investing ahead of our growth will strongly position TJX to continue expanding around the world. 
In closing, I am very pleased with our strong start to the year. It is great to see our momentum and traffic and comp sales continue. Across the company, our teams delivered sharp execution on our off-price fundamentals of disciplined inventory management, opportunistic buying and effective merchandise flow. We see a marketplace loaded with quality branded merchandise and have the liquidity to take advantage of the opportunities. With our strong first quarter, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance. At the same time, we continue to expect headwinds to our fiscal '17 pretax margins and earnings per share, including wage increases, investments to support our growth and foreign exchange as we detailed on our last call. We are confident in our plans, and again, we have a management team dedicated to achieving our goals and striving to surpass them. 
I see an exciting future ahead for TJX. We have a clear, long-term vision for growth, and I believe we are making the right investments today to support our future plans. I am confident that we will execute on our growth goals and become a $40 billion-plus company. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance, then we'll open it up for questions"

Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year, as Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance. We now expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.42, which would be up 1% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As a reminder, our plans reflect the impact of foreign currency, transactional foreign exchange and wage increases. We are assuming the combination of these items will negatively impact our fiscal '17 EPS growth by about 6%. We are also raising our full year comp store sales guidance. We now expect the comp increase of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis. For the year, we are increasing our pretax profit margin guidance to a range of 11.0% to 11.2% versus last year's 11.8%. We're now planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.4% to 28.6% versus 28.8% last year. We continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.2% to 17.3% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we now anticipate a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $50 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $665 million. 
Now to our full year guidance by division, at Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $20.7 billion to $20.9 billion. Additionally, we now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.7% to 13.9%. At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%. At TJX Canada, we're now planning a comp increase of 6% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We know expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%. At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency to be in the range of 5.6% to 5.8%. 
Now to Q2 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.79 versus last year's $0.80 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 2% to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling second quarter consolidated sales of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX. 
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Second quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.7% to 10.9% range versus 12.0% last year. We're anticipating second quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.7% to 28.8% versus 29.1% last year. This assumes continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and planned costs associated with opening our new distribution centers. We're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.8% to 17.9% range versus 16.9% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and planned investments to support our growth. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4%, a net interest expense of about $11 million. We're anticipating a weighted average share count of approximately $666 million. It's important to remember our guidance for the second quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the second quarter.

I would say the team over there is very focused on capitalizing on many categories that they feel are business opportunities. And as a result, throughout the quarter, the first quarter, the businesses just continued to get better and better. So really, I would say fourth quarter was a bit of a mishap or not on trend and we are now back to more of a trend trajectory that we expect to there."

Let's start with the first part of your question. So when you go back to the second quarter of last year on the strategy, it actually wasn't, I hate to say it this way, it wasn't as strategic and top-down driven as what people might think and we talked about this actually at some of our meetings when we've been out there over the last few months. Half of that what happened with the lower ticket beginning in the second quarter last year was really a bottom up driven strategy from down at the buyer and merchandise manager level. It goes to what you had talked about, where we were trying to balance out the mix, there were some pockets where we actually have too many better our fashion goods and we wanted to implement more moderate goods. And those were in few specific categories in the store. But when we did that, as well as overall wanted to buy in the environment where we buy better, we had a lot of liquidity, and the markets has been very full with merchandise, we wanted to buy certain items better. So that was probably half the strategy. So the combination of balancing the mix better was like a good, better, best, which was again driven by the merchandise managers and buyers. And the merchant teams in general wanting to be sharp around the values, those 2 things intersected, drove our average ticket down, and yes has driven incremental traffic and transactions. Now we talked many times that, that has continued all the way from then all the way to really the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter, and we have discussed actually what we think is going to happen. We think it's going to moderate in the second quarter as we start to come up against all of those shifts that we made last year. What has actually happened is in the first quarter, we have started to moderate already even a little bit more so than we thought we were going to do, and as you can see from the results, we're probably hitting the sweet spot and that hasn't been an issue with us, our average ticket is now not down as much as it was back then. We do we think it would be in the second quarter? with and that will continue to moderate, however, we have a lot of goods to buy and a lot of open to buy. So I think I've answered both of your questions. I think we feel like we're in a very balanced state right now, based on the order of liquidity. We don't want to be too firm of what we tell you on where we think the second quarter average ticket is going to be because we have a lot of open to buy."

One of the barriers-to-entry which I think I mentioned on a couple, answer a couple of questions ago is the tenure we have. We have low turnover in our buying organization. We've grown it to over 1,000 buyers, which, as we mentioned, is a sourcing machine. But they are now a trained sourcing machine. Because we have low turnover, it's not the quantity, it's also the quality of the merchants we have. They are very well-trained on off-price. I think the other barrier-to-entry with that respect is that we are only off-price in our business. So we are not trying to do different types of business, we are only trying to do the off-price business which I think creates another barrier-to-entry versus if we were a retailer trying to do a few different types of business. I think in terms of how we stack up as a business with relative to even arm line in general, we have a treasure hunt format which is very different than anybody else does. We have different brands, we're unique that way. We offer a touch and feel environment, treasure hunt environment, different than any other brick-and-mortar or online retailer. So that's all extremely -- those creates strong barriers-to-entry. We have a global supply chain, which is really specifically designed. It's been built over 40 years to deal with off-price goods and the flow of those goods. Again, we talked about that in the script. We have a team, a university that trains our merchants because we want to ensure that even from the young age that we bring in some of our kids into planning and through that they're getting appropriate training not just from management but from an actual university group that has a wealth of knowledge. And I would say, lastly, we have the ability to act invisibly, which makes a lot of vendors really like the relationship they have with us versus an online business or other retail business. Our goods can be, first of all, we can buy small quantity or large quantity and we can be invisible. The goods aren't in peoples' faces, so to speak. So the fast turnover obviously allow us to be more invisible, and you've heard us talk about that for every division. So I hope that answers your question."

We are really getting more involved there with how we're educating that team, and we're making some moves to really just take it to the next level. I think the beneficiary in terms of the merchandise, from things like business that are going out, isn't just also -- there's a benefit on real estate? Yes, there's a benefit on merchandise? Yes, probably, but that won't probably just for Sierra Trading Post. That will actually be also for potentially Marmaxx sites or HomeGoods sites because you never know based on some of those markets. So our real estate team is very flexible in assessing each situation no matter what stores, maybe store situations is creating opportunities, real estate-wise. But clearly, you could see how The Sports Authority and Sierra thing could relate. I get that. But no, we're pretty bullish on the Sierra Trading Post business longer term. We just want to get it into more of our philosophy of business to be less promotional. So I think we've talked about that before. We're trying to get out of the wild promotional up and down swings because that is not the way we like to retail goods. We have been focused on buying off-price behind the scenes, buying at an off-price methodology. But the retail and the goods right now, is I'd say halfway on the journey because it is still a expense promotional on the website. The stores are less promotional by the way, if you went to the stores. So our key there is really we're going to be strengthening the merchandising team in Sierra Trading Post further, and as well as the planning team to keep up with these, the seeds of the potential store growth that we're hoping to have there."

Let me first begin by saying that I'm very pleased to start the year off with such a strong first quarter. Our momentum continued with consolidated comp sales up a strong 7%, which was well above our plan and over a 5% increase last year. All 4 of our major divisions delivered strong comps, and again, this quarter, customer traffic was the driver of our comp increase. We were particularly pleased with the strong performance of apparel, including accessories and our home category. Our eclectic merchandise mix, great brands and amazing values clearly continue to resonate with consumers across all of our geographies. We believe our ability to deliver the right fashions at the right values at the right time is key to our success.
Our first quarter results continue our long track record of achieving comp sales increases in many types of retail environments, economies and geographies. We are convinced that we are growing our customer base and gaining market share. Earnings per share increased a strong 10%, also well above our expectations and over an 8% increase last year. Importantly, we achieved these results while simultaneously investing to support our growth and despite significant headwinds from foreign exchange and wage increases.
Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a solid start. We see many near- and long-term growth opportunities in the U.S. and internationally to capture market share. As always, our management team is extremely driven to achieve our plans, and we will strive to surpass them. Further, we are making strategic investments today to support our growth plans around the world and grow TJX to a $40 billion-plus company.
Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our first quarter numbers."

As Ernie mentioned, our first quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 7%, which was well above our plan and marks our 29th consecutive quarter of comp growth. I want to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division. We also saw a strong increase in our units sold again this quarter. As we anticipated, overall average ticket decreased.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.76, a 10% increase over last year's $0.69 and well above our plan. Our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 2% due to wage increases.
Consolidated pretax profit margin was 9 point -- 10.9%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was primarily due to buying and occupancy leverage on the 7% comp, partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory hedges. Despite the negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International, merchandise margins remained strong.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 70 basis points versus last year's ratio. This was better than we expected due to expense leverage on the above-planned 7% comp. Wage increases continue to be a significant headwind to SG&A, and investments to support our growth also add an unfavorable impact.
At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 7% on a constant-currency basis. During the quarter, we took advantage of some great packaway deals. We feel very comfortable with our inventory liquidity as we enter the second quarter. We are well positioned to capitalize on buying opportunities in a marketplace full of quality branded merchandise.
Now to recap our first quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a very strong 6% again this quarter, on top of last year's 3% increase. We are very pleased that our comp sales increases was entirely driven by customer traffic, and we saw significant gains in units sold. Further, the expected decrease in average ticket was less than we planned. Segment profit margin increased 10 basis points with strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandise margin. As a reminder, wage increases continued to have a significant negative impact to margins. We are very pleased with the continued excellent performance of our largest division.
HomeGoods comps increased a very strong 9% over last year's 9% growth. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. We were pleased with our strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases also had a significant negative impact to HomeGoods margins. Again, we are very happy with the traffic and comp increases we continue to see at HomeGoods. The enthusiasm of our HomeGoods customers is hard to beat.
At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 14% again this quarter over last year's 11% increase. Adjusted segment margin, excluding foreign currency, was up 190 basis points due to strong buying and occupancy leverage. The year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on this division's merchandise margins. Our Canadian organization did an excellent job of mitigating some of this currency impact. We are very pleased with the performance across all 3 of our Canadian chains.
TJX International's comps were up 4% over a 3% increase last year. We are pleased with the improvement in our comp growth since the fourth quarter. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 60 basis points. The decline was due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business. During the quarter, we opened up our 500th store in Europe, a proud milestone for our business.
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the first quarter, we bought back $375 million of TJX stock, retiring 5 million shares. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year. In addition, we increased the per share dividend by 24% march, marking the 20th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I will recap our second quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,333720349,987143,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 17, 2016",2016-05-17,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Now I'd like to review our major strengths, which differentiate TJX from many other large retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. These elements of our business give us confidence that we will continue gaining market share and growing",1539,"Thanks, Scott. Now I'd like to review our major strengths, which differentiate TJX from many other large retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. These elements of our business give us confidence that we will continue gaining market share and growing our business successfully for many years to come. We also believe this will be extremely difficult for others to replicate. For us, our value proposition always comes first. Since day 1 of our company, value has been our mission. We define value as a combination of brand, fashion, price and quality, which has resonated with consumers for many years and many types of retail and economic environments across different geographies. We are confident that our focus on the right fashions and brands at compelling off-price values will continue to differentiate TJX.
Second, we see TJX as a global sourcing machine. We have a world-class global buying organization with over 1,000 associates located in 11 countries across 4 continents. We are proud of our strong corporate culture and remain dedicated to training and developing our buyers and next generation of leaders.
Our vendor universe numbers, more than 18,000 vendors in 100-plus countries, we take pride in our vendor relationships, which we believe are some of the best in retail. With a store base of more than 3,600 stores in 9 countries, we believe we are an attractive and increasingly important outlet for vendors. We buy in many different ways and offer vendors a great deal of flexibility. We are typically willing to purchase less than full assortments of items, styles and sizes and quantities ranging from small to very large. Further, we are straightforward in our dealings and build mutually beneficial relationships for the long term. All of this allows us to offer consumers an extremely eclectic merchandise mix of well-known and emerging brands from all around the world. I am convinced this helps set us apart from most major retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online.
Next, we have a global supply chain and distribution network developed and refined over many decades to specifically support our international off-price model. The flexibility of our network allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores to react to changing market dynamics and capitalize on hot product categories and changing consumer tastes. We operate distribution centers in 6 countries, and we constantly work to improve our ability to flow the right goods to the right stores at the right time. As we continue to grow our store base and plan to enter new countries, we are expanding our supply chain to ramp up our capacity ahead of our growth.
Finally, we are leveraging our global presence. We have decades of experience operating internationally and run highly synergistic and integrated retail chains all centered around our value mission. We share initiatives, best practices and talent across our global organization. The depth of our international expertise, teams and infrastructure underscores our confidence and our ability to strengthen our leadership positions around the world and expand successfully into new international markets.
Now I'd like to recap our growth drivers, which give us confidence in our ability to gain market share for many years to come. Our #1 initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We are very pleased with our comp sales increases and traffic gains at all divisions in the first quarter. We are even more excited about the potential to see -- we see to grow our customer base both in the U.S. and internationally. Our research indicates that our traffic increases are being driven both by new customers and existing customers shopping us more frequently. I believe we become better at leveraging our global marketing capabilities every year. We take an integrated marketing approach to engage with shoppers across all age brackets through television, radio, digital, mobile and social media. This year, we are strategically targeting some of our marketing dollars to certain geographies and markets where we see the biggest opportunities. We are very happy with our creative marketing campaigns at every division this spring.
To encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of our chains, we are growing our loyalty programs. In an ever-competitive retail environment, we want to make sure that customers have a great experience every time they shop our stores. We are working to upgrade our stores everyday and are on track to remodel about 240 stores across TJX this year. Further, while our customer satisfaction scores increased again this quarter, we still see room to become even better.
As to e-commerce, while it's a small part of our business, we see it as highly complementary to our physical stores. We are being methodical in how we grow this business. We view e-commerce as another great avenue for driving traffic, both online and to our stores and growing our retail brands.
Most importantly, across our businesses, we remain laser-focused on offering shoppers an always-changing mix of exciting merchandising values. We are constantly opening new vendors and offering consumers new brands.
Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. We are confident that we can continue to open stores around the world and capitalize on first-mover advantages. We have decades of operating expertise in the U.S. and internationally, a disciplined approach to real estate and a highly integrated global supply chain and distribution network. Long term, we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores with just our current chains and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 50% store growth or almost 2,000 additional stores on top of our current base. Further, we believe significant opportunity exists beyond this.
To reiterate, our estimates do not contemplate the potential to expand into additional countries or open new chains in existing markets. As a reminder, in 2016, we plan to add approximately 195 new stores, an increase of 5%. We also have no store closings planned across our entire company this year. We believe this speaks to the strength of our business, our global operating expertise and our real estate discipline. In the smaller retail environment, our real estate teams have plenty of open-to-buy and will be opportunistic in seeking the most advantageous deals in the marketplace.
Our third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We are convinced that our drive to keep innovating and developing new seeds is a major success factor for our company. We are constantly testing new ideas and planting seeds across the company that could be very meaningful to our future growth. This includes entering new countries and testing new concepts. We are pleased with our European expansion into Austria and The Netherlands as well as the potential we see for our business in Australia, our third continent. We continue to test our Sierra Trading Post stores, and we will be very pleased if we could eventually roll this out as a fourth major U.S. chain. Intelligent risk-taking is part of our DNA, and we have many initiatives up our sleeves.
To support our near- and long-term goals for growth, we are making strategic investments in the business. We have many initiatives underway and many more planned to bring TJX to the next level of growth. We take a disciplined approach and are balancing our growth with investments to strengthen our foundation to support our future plans. As we discussed when we announced our earnings at year end, we are making significant investments in our business. This includes new stores and remodels, our supply chain and infrastructure, new seeds for growth and developing talent as well as our previously announced wage increases. We see investing in our associates and preserving our strong corporate culture as imperative to our continued success. Further, we are investing in initiatives that can benefit from our decades of knowledge and expertise in growing a global off-price business. While these investments impact our EPS growth, we are confident that investing ahead of our growth will strongly position TJX to continue expanding around the world.
In closing, I am very pleased with our strong start to the year. It is great to see our momentum in traffic and comp sales continue. Across the company, our teams delivered sharp execution on our off-price fundamentals of disciplined inventory management, opportunistic buying and effective merchandise flow. We see a marketplace loaded with quality branded merchandise and have the liquidity to take advantage of the opportunities. With our strong first quarter, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance. At the same time, we continue to expect headwinds to our fiscal '17 pretax margins and earnings per share, including wage increases, investments to support our growth and foreign exchange as we detailed on our last call.
We are confident in our plans, and again, we have a management team dedicated to achieving our goals and striving to surpass them. I see an exciting future ahead for TJX. We have a clear, long-term vision for growth, and I believe we are making the right investments today to support our future plans. I am confident that we will execute on our growth goals and become a $40 billion-plus company.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance, then we'll open it up for questions."

As Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance. We now expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.42, which would be up 1% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As a reminder, our plans reflect the impact of foreign currency, transactional foreign exchange and wage increases. We are assuming the combination of these items will negatively impact our fiscal '17 EPS growth by about 6%. 
We are also raising our full year comp store sales guidance. We now expect a comp increase of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis.
For the year, we are increasing our pretax profit margin guidance to a range of 11.0% to 11.2% versus last year's 11.8%. We are now planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.4% to 28.6% versus 28.8% last year.
We continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.2% to 17.3% versus 16.8% last year.
For modeling purposes, we now anticipate a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $50 million.
We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 665 million.
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $20.7 billion to $20.9 billion. Additionally, we now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.7% to 13.9%. 
At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%.
At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 6% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We know expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%.
At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.6% to 5.8%.
Now to Q2 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.79 versus last year's $0.80 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 2% to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange.
We're modeling second quarter consolidated sales of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX.
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx.
Second quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.7% to 10.9% range versus 12.0% last year. We're anticipating second quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.7% to 28.8% versus 29.1% last year. This assumes continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and planned costs associated with opening our new distribution centers.
We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the range of 17.8% to 17.9% range versus 16.9% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and planned investments to support our growth.
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense of about $11 million.
We're anticipating a weighted average share count of approximately 666 million.
It's important to remember our guidance for the second quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the second quarter.

Again, the -- probably the only thing I would nuance there is that the volume of the stores, as we've said over the last few years, are not at the same or less than the average volume of our chain averages at the divisions, a little more pronounced at Marmaxx and HomeGoods. And other than that, again, beating pro formas, and there's really nothing new to talk about there. The only thing is in our ability to get our 5% growth targets are the almost 200 stores this year. As Ernie said, given the retail environment, it's probably as good as it's been in the last few years."

So first of all, funky dynamics going on in the environment over there, as you know, which we do believe that was a piece of what affected us in the fourth quarter, as well as we had some missed opportunity categories, I would call it, that we have now, when you asked what did we fix or what did we change, I would say the team over there is very focused on capitalizing on many categories that they feel are business opportunities. And as a result, the -- throughout the quarter, the first quarter, that business has just been -- continued to get better and better. So really, I would say fourth quarter was a bit of a mishap or not on trend, and we are now back to more of the trend trajectory that we expect there."

And it seems like the strategy to fortify those opening price points, which obviously caused a decline in the average out-the-door ticket price, has been extremely successful, because I think that your traffic numbers have significantly accelerated with this strategy.

Let's start with the first part of your question. So when you go back to the second quarter of last year on the strategy, it actually wasn't, I hate to say it this way, wasn't as strategic as -- and top-down driven as what people might think, and we talked about this actually at some of our meetings when we've been out there over the last few months. Half of that what happened with the lower ticket beginning in the second quarter last year was really a bottom-up driven strategy from down at the buyer and merchandise manager level. And now it goes to what you had talked about where we were trying to balance off the mix, so we -- there were some pockets where we actually had too many better or fashion goods and we wanted to implement more moderate goods. And those were in a few specific categories in the store. But when we did that as well as overall wanted to buy in the environment where we buy better, we had a lot of liquidity, the market's been very full with merchandise, we wanted to buy certain items better. So that was probably half the strategy. So the combination of balancing the mix better was like a good, better, best, which was, again, driven by the merchandise managers and buyers. And the merchant teams, in general, wanting to be sharp around the values, those 2 things intersected drove our average ticket down and yes, has driven incremental traffic and transactions. Now we've talked many times how that has continued all the way from then all the way through really the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter, and we have discussed actually what do we think is going to happen as we think it's going to moderate in the second quarter as we start to come up against all of those shifts that we made last year. What has actually happened is in the first quarter, we have started to moderate already even a little bit more so than we thought we were going to do. And as you can see from the results, we're probably hitting the sweet spot, and that hasn't been an issue with us. Our average ticket is now not down as much as it was back then. And where do we think it'll be in the second quarter? We think it'll continue to moderate. However, we have a lot of goods still to buy and a lot of open-to-buy. So well, I think I've answered both your questions. I think we feel like we're in a balanced -- very balanced state right now based on the order of the liquidity. We don't want to be too firm of what we tell you on where we think the second quarter average ticket is going to be because we have a lot of open-to-buy."

One of the barriers-to-entry is, which I think I mentioned on a couple -- on an answer a couple of questions ago, is the tenure we have. We have low turnover in our buying organization. We've grown it to over 1,000 buyers, which, as we mentioned, is a sourcing machine, but they are now a trained sourcing machine. Because we have low turnover, it's not the quantity, it's also the quality of the merchants we have. They are very well trained on off-price. I think the other barrier-to-entry with that respect is that we are only off-price in our business. So we are not trying to do different types of business. We are only trying to do the off-price business, which I think creates another barrier-to-entry versus if we were a retailer trying to do a few different types of business. I think in terms of how we stack up as a business with -- relative to even online in general, we have a treasure hunt format, which is very different than anybody else does. We have different brands. We're unique that way. We offer a touch-and-feel environment, treasure-hunt environment, different than any other brick-and-mortar or online retailer. So that's all extremely -- those create strong barriers-to-entry. We have a global supply chain, which is really specifically designed, and it's been built over 40 years to deal with off-price goods and the flow of those goods. Again, we talked about that in the script. We have a team, we have a university that trains our merchants because we want to ensure that even from the young age that we bring in some of our kids into planning and through that they're getting appropriate training, not just from management but from an actual university group that has a wealth of knowledge. And I would say, lastly, we have the ability to act invisibly, which makes a lot of vendors really like the relationship they have with us versus an online business or another retail business. Our goods can be -- first of all, we can buy small quantity or large quantity, and we can be invisible. The goods aren't in people's faces, so to speak. So the fast turnover, obviously, allows us to be more invisible, and you've heard about us talk about that for every division. So I hope that answers your question."

Based on the environment going on, that's probably no surprise. The good news is we have done a pretty diligent job at controlling the open-to-buy, and we are very liquid across the board and all the divisions. Our inventory was up a shade right now, a little bit more than a normal is, but that's because there's been some really strong packaway deals that we've been able to do, which I think I'm getting at, at the other part of your question. Some packaway deals that we think are going to help us for -- going forward into third quarter and the back half. So we took advantage of those, like you said, coming off the winter we just had.

So one of the things that you not always pretend to have is a good flow-through on markdowns if we -- especially at the comp levels that we saw. Our Canadian division has done an exceptional job of -- we still have that significant increase in the first quarter. Having said that, we still had a large impact to the merchandise margin in Canada, but they mitigated a significant amount. So I think that has been a story for the last couple of quarters. But it does get harder and harder as every year you go when the dollar is, the Canadian dollars is down. So I think those were 2 things we're certainly very pleased about."

It's helped the turns, and it helps our profitability because we're not -- we're more eclectic, which is what -- which is where our business is healthier when we do that. So that's a positive. And the flow, certainly, all divisions have really done an excellent job on maintaining the open-to-buy, as we said on an earlier question and mix this environment. And that's always -- when you were asking, is there anything related to the buying, helping the margins, I think that's certainly a positive, the way we're positioned going forward."

First of all, for Sierra, so what we're doing now is obviously opening stores. And the more bullish we get, I think I mentioned this on the script, we feel like there could be some upside for this to be more of a major player in the outdoor space. What do we need? We just need some more, I guess, TJX sizing of the business, which we're continuing to do. We are really getting more involved there with how we're educating that team, and we're making some moves to really just take it to the next level. I think the beneficiary in terms of the merchandise from things like your -- business that are going out isn't just also on -- it's -- there's a benefit on real estate, yes; there's a benefit on merchandise, yes, probably. But that won't probably just for Sierra Trading Post. That'll actually be also for potentially Marmaxx sites or HomeGoods sites because you never know based on some of those markets. So our real estate team is very flexible in assessing each situation no matter what store is -- maybe store situation is creating opportunities real estate-wise. But clearly, you could see how the Sports Authority and Sierra thing could relate. I get that. But no, we're pretty bullish on the Sierra Trading Post business longer term. We just want to get it into more of our philosophy of business to be less promotional. So I think we've talked about that before. We're trying to get out of the wild promotional up and down swings because that is not the way we like to retail goods. We've been focused on buying off-price behind the scenes, buying at an off-price methodology. But the retail and the goods right now, I'd say is halfway on the journey because it is still a little promotional on the website. The stores are less promotional, by the way, if you went to the stores. So our key there is really we're going to be strengthening the merchandising team in Sierra Trading Post further and as well as the planning team to keep up with these -- the seeds of the potential store growth that we're hoping to have there."

But on the first part, the Trade -- we're very pleased with how Trade Secret is beginning the TJX sizing process, I guess, you would describe it as, which is I think what you were asking about. We are putting in a lot of processes and systems, talent from here, from back here. Again, we've had a handful of people move over there, and our head merchant relocated from Canada back a while ago, so she is making terrific progress, the division. And she reports to Michael MacMillan who travels over there frequently and makes sure that we are trying to do the core execution priorities in the business that are important to them. So we're dealing with stores. We're dealing with distribution, supply chain. We're dealing with merchants. We're dealing with marketing. We're dealing with HR organizational structure issues to get it set. Again, not a big business yet. It is, I would tell you, one of the most exciting environments we find Australia to be extremely tailor-made for a TJX prototype and the customers really will gravitate to. When we have the right goods, they -- our turns there are much, much improved. We just right now are trying to get to the point where we can flow the right goods consistently because what's they're still on the learning curve of. We started to look at remodels, and we will be opening a logistics center in the near future because they used to, believe it or not, drop-ship their merchandise. So all good things, all things we knew going in, and we're excited about it.

Let me first begin by saying that I'm very pleased to start the year off with such a strong first quarter. Our momentum continued with consolidated comp sales up a strong 7%, which was well above our plan and over a 5% increase last year. All 4 of our major divisions delivered strong comps, and again, this quarter, customer traffic was the driver of our comp increases. We were particularly pleased with the strong performance of apparel, including accessories and our home category. Our eclectic merchandise mix, great brands and amazing values clearly continue to resonate with consumers across all of our geographies. We believe our ability to deliver the right fashions at the right values at the right time is key to our success.
Our first quarter results continue our long track record of achieving comp sales increases in many types of retail environments, economies and geographies. We are convinced that we are growing our customer base and gaining market share. Earnings per share increased a strong 10%, also well above our expectations and over an 8% increase last year. Importantly, we achieved these results while simultaneously investing to support our growth and despite significant headwinds from foreign exchange and wage increases.
Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a solid start. We see many near- and long-term growth opportunities in the U.S. and internationally to capture market share. As always, our management team is extremely driven to achieve our plans, and we will strive to surpass them. Further, we are making strategic investments today to support our growth plans around the world and grow TJX to a $40 billion-plus company.
Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our first quarter numbers."
306688,333720349,987367,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 17, 2016",2016-05-17,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.

As Ernie mentioned, our first quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 7%, which was well above our plan and marks our 29th consecutive quarter of comp growth. I want to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division. We also saw a strong increase in our units sold again this quarter. As we anticipated, overall average ticket decreased.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.76, a 10% increase over last year's $0.69 and well above our plan. Our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange and about 2% due to wage increases.
Consolidated pretax profit margin was 9 point -- 10.9%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 28.8%, up 50 basis points versus last year. This was primarily due to buying and occupancy leverage on the 7% comp, partially offset by the mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory hedges. Despite the negative impact from transactional foreign exchange at TJX Canada and TJX International, merchandise margins remained strong.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 70 basis points versus last year's ratio. This was better than we expected due to expense leverage on the above-plan 7% comp. Wage increases continued to be a significant headwind to SG&A, and investments to support our growth also had an unfavorable impact.
At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 7% on a constant-currency basis. During the quarter, we took advantage of some great packaway deals. We feel very comfortable with our inventory liquidity as we enter the second quarter. We are well positioned to capitalize on buying opportunities in a marketplace full of quality branded merchandise.
Now to recap our first quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a very strong 6% again this quarter, on top of last year's 3% increase. We are very pleased that our comp sales increases was entirely driven by customer traffic, and we saw significant gains in units sold. Further, the expected decrease in average ticket was less than we planned. Segment profit margin increased 10 basis points with strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandise margins. As a reminder, wage increases continued to have a significant negative impact to margins. We are very pleased with the continued excellent performance of our largest division.
HomeGoods comps increased a very strong 9% over last year's 9% growth. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. We were pleased with our strong buying and occupancy leverage and increased merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases also had a significant negative impact to HomeGoods margins. Again, we are very happy with the traffic and comp increases we continue to see at HomeGoods. The enthusiasm of our HomeGoods customers is hard to beat.
At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 14% again this quarter over last year's 11% increase. Adjusted segment margin, excluding foreign currency, was up 190 basis points due to strong buying and occupancy leverage. The year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar continued to have a significant negative impact on this division's merchandise margins. Our Canadian organization did an excellent job of mitigating some of this currency impact. We are very pleased with the performance across all 3 of our Canadian chains.
TJX International's comps were up 4% over a 3% increase last year. We are pleased with the improvement in our comp growth since the fourth quarter. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 60 basis points. The decline was due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business. During the quarter, we opened up our 500th store in Europe, a proud milestone for our business.
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the first quarter, we bought back $375 million of TJX stock, retiring 5 million shares. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year. In addition, we increased the per share dividend by 24% march [ph], marking the 20th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I will recap our second quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,333720349,987367,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 17, 2016",2016-05-17,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Now I'd like to review our major strengths, which differentiate TJX from many other large retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. These elements of our business give us confidence that we will continue gaining market share and growing",1542,"Thanks, Scott. Now I'd like to review our major strengths, which differentiate TJX from many other large retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. These elements of our business give us confidence that we will continue gaining market share and growing our business successfully for many years to come. We also believe these will be extremely difficult for others to replicate. For us, our value proposition always comes first. Since day 1 of our company, value has been our mission. We define value as a combination of brand, fashion, price and quality, which has resonated with consumers for many years and many types of retail and economic environments across different geographies. We are confident that our focus on the right fashions and brands at compelling off-price values will continue to differentiate TJX.
Second, we see TJX as a global sourcing machine. We have a world-class global buying organization with over 1,000 associates located in 11 countries across 4 continents. We are proud of our strong corporate culture and remain dedicated to training and developing our buyers and next generation of leaders.
Our vendor universe numbers more than 18,000 vendors in 100-plus countries. We take pride in our vendor relationships, which we believe are some of the best in retail. With a store base of more than 3,600 stores in 9 countries, we believe we are an attractive and increasingly important outlet for vendors. We buy in many different ways and offer vendors a great deal of flexibility. We are typically willing to purchase less than full assortments of items, styles and sizes and quantities ranging from small to very large. Further, we are straightforward in our dealings and build mutually beneficial relationships for the long term. All of this allows us to offer consumers an extremely eclectic merchandise mix of well-known and emerging brands from all around the world. I am convinced this helps set us apart from most major retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online.
Next, we have a global supply chain and distribution network developed and refined over many decades to specifically support our international off-price model. The flexibility of our network allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores to react to changing market dynamics and capitalize on hot product categories and changing consumer tastes. We operate distribution centers in 6 countries, and we constantly work to improve our ability to flow the right goods to the right stores at the right time. As we continue to grow our store base and plan to enter new countries, we are expanding our supply chain to ramp up our capacity ahead of our growth.
Finally, we are leveraging our global presence. We have decades of experience operating internationally and run highly synergistic and integrated retail chains all centered around our value mission. We share initiatives, best practices and talent across our global organization. The depth of our international expertise, teams and infrastructure underscores our confidence and our ability to strengthen our leadership positions around the world and expand successfully into new international markets.
Now I'd like to recap our growth drivers, which give us confidence in our ability to gain market share for many years to come. Our #1 initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We were very pleased with our comp sales increases and traffic gains at all divisions in the first quarter. We are even more excited about the potential to see -- we see to grow our customer base both in the U.S. and internationally. Our research indicates that our traffic increases are being driven both by new customers and existing customers shopping us more frequently. I believe we become better at leveraging our global marketing capabilities every year. We take an integrated marketing approach to engage with shoppers across all age brackets through television, radio, digital, mobile and social media. This year, we are strategically targeting some of our marketing dollars to certain geographies and markets where we see the biggest opportunities. We are very happy with our creative marketing campaigns at every division this spring.
To encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of our chains, we are growing our loyalty programs. In an ever-competitive retail environment, we want to make sure that customers have a great experience every time they shop our stores. We are working to upgrade our stores every day and are on track to remodel about 240 stores across TJX this year. Further, while our customer satisfaction scores increased again this quarter, we still see room to become even better.
As to e-commerce, while it's a small part of our business, we see it as highly complementary to our physical stores. We are being methodical in how we grow this business. We view e-commerce as another great avenue for driving traffic, both online and to our stores and growing our retail brands.
Most importantly, across our businesses, we remain laser-focused on offering shoppers an always-changing mix of exciting merchandise and values. We are constantly opening new vendors and offering consumers new brands.
Our second major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. We are confident that we can continue to open stores around the world and capitalize on first-mover advantages. We have decades of operating expertise in the U.S. and internationally, a disciplined approach to real estate and a highly integrated global supply chain and distribution network. Long term, we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores with just our current chains and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 50% store growth or almost 2,000 additional stores on top of our current base. Further, we believe significant opportunity exists beyond this.
To reiterate, our estimates do not contemplate the potential to expand into additional countries or open new chains in existing markets. As a reminder, in 2016, we plan to add approximately 195 new stores, an increase of 5%. We also have no store closings planned across our entire company this year. We believe this speaks to the strength of our business, our global operating expertise and our real estate discipline. In this squall [ph] of retail environment, our real estate teams have plenty of open-to-buy and will be opportunistic in seeking the most advantageous deals in the marketplace.
Our third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We are convinced that our drive to keep innovating and developing new seeds is a major success factor for our company. We are constantly testing new ideas and planting seeds across the company that could be very meaningful to our future growth. This includes entering new countries and testing new concepts. We are pleased with our European expansion into Austria and The Netherlands as well as the potential we see for our business in Australia, our third continent. We continue to test our Sierra Trading Post stores, and we would be very pleased if we could eventually roll this out as a fourth major U.S. chain. Intelligent risk-taking is part of our DNA, and we have many initiatives up our sleeves.
To support our near- and long-term goals for growth, we are making strategic investments in the business. We have many initiatives underway and many more planned to bring TJX to the next level of growth. We take a disciplined approach and are balancing our growth with investments to strengthen our foundation to support our future plans. As we discussed when we announced our earnings at year-end, we are making significant investments in our business. This includes new stores and remodels, our supply chain and infrastructure, new seeds for growth and developing talent as well as our previously announced wage increases. We see investing in our associates and preserving our strong corporate culture as imperative to our continued success. Further, we are investing in initiatives that can benefit from our decades of knowledge and expertise in growing a global off-price business. While these investments impact our EPS growth, we are confident that investing ahead of our growth will strongly position TJX to continue expanding around the world.
In closing, I am very pleased with our strong start to the year. It is great to see our momentum in traffic and comp sales continue. Across the company, our teams delivered sharp execution on our off-price fundamentals of disciplined inventory management, opportunistic buying and effective merchandise flow. We see a marketplace loaded with quality branded merchandise and have the liquidity to take advantage of the opportunities. With our strong first quarter, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance. At the same time, we continue to expect headwinds to our fiscal '17 pretax margins and earnings per share, including wage increases, investments to support our growth and foreign exchange as we detailed on our last call.
We are confident in our plans, and again, we have a management team dedicated to achieving our goals and striving to surpass them. I see an exciting future ahead for TJX. We have a clear, long-term vision for growth, and I believe we are making the right investments today to support our future plans. I am confident that we will execute on our growth goals and become a $40 billion-plus company.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance, then we'll open it up for questions."

As Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance. We now expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.42, which would be up 1% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As a reminder, our plans reflect the impact of foreign currency, transactional foreign exchange and wage increases. We are assuming the combination of these items will negatively impact our fiscal '17 EPS growth by about 6%. 
We are also raising our full year comp store sales guidance. We now expect a comp increase of 2% to 3% on a consolidated basis.
For the year, we are increasing our pretax profit margin guidance to a range of 11.0% to 11.2% versus last year's 11.8%. We are now planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.4% to 28.6% versus 28.8% last year.
We continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 17.2% to 17.3% versus 16.8% last year.
For modeling purposes, we now anticipate a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $50 million.
We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 665 million.
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $20.7 billion to $20.9 billion. Additionally, we now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.7% to 13.9%. 
At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%.
At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 6% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We know expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.1%.
At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.6% to 5.8%.
Now to Q2 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.79 versus last year's $0.80 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 2% to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange.
We're modeling second quarter consolidated sales of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. This guidance assumes a 1% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX.
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx.
Second quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.7% to 10.9% range versus 12.0% last year. We're anticipating second quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.7% to 28.8% versus 29.1% last year. This assumes continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and planned costs associated with opening our new distribution centers.
We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the range of 17.8% to 17.9% range versus 16.9% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and planned investments to support our growth.
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense of about $11 million.
We're anticipating a weighted average share count of approximately 666 million.
It's important to remember our guidance for the second quarter and full year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the second quarter.

So first of all, funky dynamics going on in the environment over there, as you know, which we do believe that was a piece of what affected us in the fourth quarter, as well as we had some missed opportunity categories, I would call it, that we have now, when you ask what did we fix or what did we change, I would say the team over there is very focused on capitalizing on any categories that they feel are business opportunities. And as a result, the -- throughout the quarter, the first quarter, that business has just been -- continued to get better and better. So really, I would say fourth quarter was a bit of a mishap or not on trend, and we are now back to more of the trend trajectory that we expect there."

And it seems like the strategy to fortify those opening price points, which obviously caused a decline in the average out-the-door ticket price, has been extremely successful, because I think that your traffic numbers have significantly accelerated with this strategy.

Let's start with the first part of your question. So when you go back to the second quarter of last year on the strategy, it actually wasn't, I hate to say it this way, wasn't as strategic as -- and top-down driven as what people might think, and we talked about this actually at some of our meetings when we've been out there over the last few months. Half of that -- what happened with the lower ticket beginning in the second quarter last year was really a bottom-up driven strategy from down at the buyer and merchandise manager level. And now it goes to what you had talked about where we were trying to balance off the mix, so we -- there were some pockets where we actually had too many better or fashion goods and we wanted to implement more moderate goods. And those were in a few specific categories in the store. But when we did that as well as overall wanted to buy in the environment where we buy better, we had a lot of liquidity, the market's been very full with merchandise, we wanted to buy certain items better. So that was probably half the strategy. So the combination of balancing the mix better was like a good, better, best, which was, again, driven by the merchandise managers and buyers. And the merchant teams, in general, wanting to be sharper on the values, those 2 things intersected, drove our average ticket down and yes, has driven incremental traffic and transactions. Now we've talked many times how that has continued all the way from then all the way through really the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter, and we have discussed actually what do we think is going to happen as we think it's going to moderate in the second quarter as we start to come up against all of those shifts that we made last year. What has actually happened is in the first quarter, we have started to moderate already even a little bit more so than we thought we were going to do. And as you can see from the results, we're probably hitting the sweet spot, and that hasn't been an issue with us. Our average ticket is now not down as much as it was back then. And where do we think it'll be in the second quarter? We think it'll continue to moderate. However, we have a lot of goods still to buy and a lot of open-to-buy. So well, I think I've answered both your questions. I think we feel like we're in a balanced -- very balanced state right now based on the on-order of the liquidity. We don't want to be too firm on what we tell you on where we think the second quarter average ticket is going to be because we have a lot of open-to-buy."

One of the barriers-to-entry is, which I think I mentioned on a couple -- on an answer a couple of questions ago, is the tenure we have. We have low turnover in our buying organization. We've grown it to over 1,000 buyers, which, as we mentioned, is a sourcing machine, but they are now a trained sourcing machine. Because we have low turnover, it's not the quantity, it's also the quality of the merchants we have. They are very well trained on off-price. I think the other barrier-to-entry with that respect is that we are only off-price in our business. So we are not trying to do different types of business. We are only trying to do the off-price business, which I think creates another barrier-to-entry versus if we were a retailer trying to do a few different types of business. I think in terms of how we stack up as a business with -- relative to even online in general, we have a treasure hunt format, which is very different than anybody else does. We have different brands. We're unique that way. We offer a touch-and-feel environment, treasure-hunt environment, different than any other brick-and-mortar or online retailer. So that's all extremely -- those create strong barriers-to-entry. We have a global supply chain, which is really specifically designed, and it's been built over 40 years to deal with off-price goods and the flow of those goods. Again, we talked about that in the script. We have a team, we have a university that trains our merchants because we want to ensure that even from the young age that we bring in some of our kids into planning and through that they're getting appropriate training, not just from management but from an actual university group that has a wealth of knowledge. And I would say, lastly, we have the ability to act invisibly, which makes a lot of vendors really like the relationship they have with us versus an online business or another retail business. Our goods can be -- first of all, we can buy small quantity or large quantity, and we can be invisible. The goods aren't in people's faces, so to speak. So the fast turnover, obviously, allows us to be more invisible, and you've heard about us talk about that for every division. So I hope that answers your question."

We are -- well, we are in one of those modes right now where one of our most difficult challenges is controlling how much we buy right now because the markets are plentiful, and they are plentiful with spring summer goods coming up. Based on the environment going on, that's probably no surprise. The good news is we have done a pretty diligent job at controlling the open-to-buy, and we are very liquid across the board in all the divisions. Our inventory is up a shade right now, a little bit more than it normal is, but that's because there's been some really strong packaway deals that we've been able to do, which I think I'm getting at the other part of your question. Some packaway deals that we think are going to help us for -- going forward into third quarter and the back half. So we took advantage of those, like you said, coming off the winter we just had. And we feel really good about those. The merchants have controlled the open-to-buy amidst that liquidity you're talking about, knowing that it feels like the environment is going to continue this way for a while.

So our real estate team is very flexible in assessing each situation no matter what store is -- maybe store situation is creating opportunities real estate-wise. But clearly, you could see how the Sports Authority and Sierra thing could relate. I get that. But no, we're pretty bullish on the Sierra Trading Post business longer term. We just want to get it into more of our philosophy of business to be less promotional. So I think we've talked about that before. We're trying to get out of the wild promotional up and down swings because that is not the way we like to retail goods. We've been focused on buying off-price behind the scenes, buying at an off-price methodology. But the retail and the goods right now, I'd say is halfway on the journey because it is still a little promotional on the website. The stores are less promotional, by the way, if you went to the stores. So our key there is really we're going to be strengthening the merchandising team in Sierra Trading Post further and as well as the planning team to keep up with these -- the seeds of the potential store growth that we're hoping to have there."

We are putting in a lot of processes and systems, talent from here, from back here. Again, we've had a handful of people move over there, and our head merchant relocated from Canada back a while ago, so she is making terrific progress, the division. And she reports to Michael MacMillan who travels over there frequently and makes sure that we are trying to do the core execution priorities in the business that are important to them. So we're dealing with stores. We're dealing with distribution, supply chain. We're dealing with merchants. We're dealing with marketing. We're dealing with HR organizational structure issues to get it set. Again, not a big business yet. It is, I would tell you, one of the most exciting environments we find Australia to be extremely tailor-made for a TJX prototype and the customers really will gravitate to. When we have the right goods, they -- our turns there are much, much improved. We just right now are trying to get to the point where we can flow the right goods consistently because what they're still on the learning curve of.

Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our second quarter results. Consolidated comp store sales grew a strong 4% over a 6% increase last year and above our plan. This marks the 30th consecutive quarter of comp growth for TJX. We are thrilled that the comp was once again driven almost entirely by customer traffic. This is also the seventh consecutive quarter that traffic was the primary driver of our comp increase. In addition, it was great to see the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increases at all 4 major divisions as our great brands, amazing values and eclectic merchandise mix keep resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are attracting new customers, driving more frequent visits to our stores and gaining market share. 
Further, we are pleased with the strong performance across our apparel areas, including accessories and home businesses. Earnings per share increased 5%, well above our expectations and over strong increase last year. We achieved these results despite significant headwinds from wage increases and investments to support our growth. 
Further, we were extremely pleased with our strong merchandise margin increase despite a significant impact from transactional foreign exchange. Our results once again demonstrate the power of our flexible business model and our ability to execute across many different retail environments. 
With our strong second quarter performance, we are raising our full year comp and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, the third quarter is off to a solid start, and we have many initiatives planned for the back half of the year to keep driving traffic and sales. We are confident we will achieve our goals and as always, our management team will strive to surpass them. We see many near- and long-term opportunities for growth and are well on our way to growing TJX to a $40 billion-plus company. 
Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter numbers."
306688,378672104,1035928,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.

As Ernie mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over last year's 6% growth, which was above our plan. I wanted to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division again this quarter. It was also great to see an increase in our units sold for another consecutive quarter. Average ticket decreased slightly more than planned. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.84, a 5% increase over last year's $0.80 and well above our plan. As expected, our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to wage increases. The impact of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange had a neutral impact to EPS growth versus our expectation of a 2% negative impact. Consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.6%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.4%, up 30 basis points versus last year and significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to a strong increase in merchandise margins and gains on our inventory hedges. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had planned. 
At the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were flat on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased with our lean inventory position entering the third quarter as we are set up extremely well to flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the back half of the year. 
Now to recap our second quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a strong 4% this quarter on top of last year's 4% increase. Once again, it was terrific to see customer traffic as the primary driver of the comp increase. We continue to see a decrease in average ticket and significant increase in units sold. We are pleased that our merchandise mix and values remain a great draw for customers, which tells us that our strategies to balance the mix are -- and offer even better values are working. Segment profit margin decreased 30 basis points as our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with a lower average ticket. We are very pleased with the comp and traffic momentum at our largest division and had many initiatives planned to keep gaining market share. 
HomeGoods delivered another great quarter, with comps increasing 5% over last year's 9% growth. Segment profit margin was up 50 basis points due to an extremely strong increase in merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact in HomeGoods margin. Separately, to support the long-term growth potential of this chain, we opened a new distribution center in Tucson, Arizona in the second quarter. As a reminder, we see the potential to expand HomeGoods to be 1,000-store chain, nearly double its current size. 
At TJX Canada's -- at TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 9% this quarter, over last year's 12% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 150 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to the negative impact at the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had on merchandise margins. That said, we're very pleased with the sharp execution of our Canadian organization, which mitigated some of this pressure. TJX's Canada's margins were also impacted by an increased -- by increased supply chain cost as we opened a new distribution center to support this country's future growth. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we have seen across all 3 of our Canadian chains. 
TJX International's comps were up 2%, over a 5% increase last year. While sales in the U.K. were slightly lower than we planned, our trends leading up to the Brexit vote were very strong. In addition, we were pleased to perform much better than many major retailers in the U.K. as the Brexit vote weighed on consumers there. We believe we are gaining significant market share in this environment. This speaks to our resiliency and ability to drive sales even in challenging times. 
As a whole, TJX International comps were in line with our plans due to the strong performance of our other European regions. It was also nice to see the benefit of our diversified European store base this quarter. 
Further, as we began the third quarter, comps in the U.K. had been positive. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 260 basis points. This decline was primarily due to a combination of integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business, investments to support growth and wage increases. We feel great about our international growth potential and our many -- and our opportunity to maximize our first-mover advantages in many geographies. 
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the second quarter, we bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first half of the year, we have retired 10.2 million shares, buying back $775 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our third quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,378672104,1035928,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe this strengths not only differentiate T.J. Maxx -- TJX from most other major retailers, but also position us for continued success, particularly in toda",1020,"Thanks, Scott. I'll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe this strengths not only differentiate T.J. Maxx -- TJX from most other major retailers, but also position us for continued success, particularly in today's retail environment. 
First, we are a global sourcing machine, a world-class buying organization, has more than 1,000 associates seeking the best merchandise from the universe of more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. We are extremely proud of the depth, experience and longevity of our buying teams, which we are convinced, is a major TJX advantage. 
Second, our global supply chain distribution network and proprietary systems have been built and refined to support our global off-price business model. The flexibility of our global infrastructure allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores and respond rapidly to changing consumer and market trends. We believe this is a key advantage in any retail environment. 
Next, we are leveraging our global presence and expertise. Our 4 major divisions operate as 1 TJX across 9 countries and 3 continents and are highly integrated and synergistic. We have a culture where associates are encouraged to share ideas, initiatives and best practices that can be leveraged across our businesses. All of these factors that differentiate TJX enable us to deliver amazing value to consumers. Value has been the mission of our company since day 1. We are confident that offering consumers quality, branded merchandise at great values will continue to attract more U.S. and international shoppers to our stores. 
Now I'll briefly recap our 3 major growth drivers. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. Our results tell us that our strategies and initiatives are working. We are even more excited about the opportunity we see to capture additional market share in the U.S. and internationally. While e-commerce represents a very small percentage of our overall sales, we see it as a complement to our physical location and another way to drive incremental sales and traffic. 
Next, is our enormous global growth -- store growth potential. With nearly 3,700 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. This includes nearly 1,400 more stores in North America and over 500 additional stores in Europe and Australia. This reflects the opportunity we see with just our current chains and just our current markets alone, and that's before contemplating the potential to expand into new countries or open new chains in existing markets. 
Our third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We're always new ideas and initiatives across the company that could lead to new categories or meaningful drivers of future growth. I am convinced that our constant focus on innovation will keep us differentiated from the rest of the retail world. To support our goals for growth, we continue to make significant investments in the business. We are investing where we believe we can capitalize on our first-mover advantages and build upon our leadership positions around the world. While we expect our investments in new seeds, IT systems, supply chain, including distribution centers and talent to impact our EPS growth in the short term, we are confident that they will allow us to gain additional market share in the long term. 
Now I'll spend a moment on our opportunities for the back half of the year. First, we have many exciting gift-giving initiatives planned for the holiday season. Every year, our goal is to be even better than the year before. We'll be offering amazing gift selections from around the world, all at exciting values and shipping them throughout the holiday season. I believe all these factors will be a major differentiator for our -- for all of our retail brands this holiday season. 
Second, I'm very excited about our marketing strategy for the back half. We feel very good about our fall creative campaigns. And during the holiday season, we will be rolling out our tri-branding campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. We'll also continue our integrated marketing approach to TV, digital, mobile and social media to engage a wide shopper demographic. 
Third, to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping our brands, we're growing our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. We also continue to be pleased with our pilot program in the U.K. 
Next, every day, we work to upgrade the shopping experience in our stores. Our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division in the second quarter, and we have a number of plans for the back half. We believe our in-store initiatives will make the shopping experience exciting, convenient and extremely positive for consumers during this busy time of year. 
Lastly, we see a marketplace that is loaded with quality-branded goods. We are extremely pleased with the abundance of merchandise available to us for the fall and winter seasons. 
In closing, I am so proud of our organization's excellent performance in the second quarter. Marmaxx, TJX Canada and HomeGoods significantly outperformed their plans, and TJX International proved, once again, the resiliency of our off-price model in challenging times. In today's uncertain environment, both in the U.S. and internationally, the power and flexibility of our off-price model gives me and our entire management team tremendous confidence. TJX is a company that has achieved sales and profit growth through many kinds of retail, economic and political climate. Throughout our history, we have seen time and time again that when we stay focused on execution and we deliver compelling brands, fashion and values to consumers, we succeed. 
I am convinced we are gaining market share, and I am excited about our opportunities for the second half of the year. We remain laser-focused on driving traffic and sales across all divisions. Our management team is committed to achieving our plans, and we're passionate about surpassing them. I'm very confident that we have the people and strategy in place to successfully achieve our goals for the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."

Before I begin, I wanted to -- I want to briefly talk to the implication of Brexit for us going forward. We continue to monitor the situation very closely, including how we may need to adapt to comply with potential changes such as new regulations or requirements. We remain as confident as ever in the strength and growth prospects of our European business. Further, we are convinced that the flexibility of our business model will continue to serve us well and allow us to gain market share and capitalize on the off-price buying opportunities that disruptions in the marketplace tend to create. 
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. As we stated in our press release this morning, we recently offered eligible former TJX associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit an opportunity to receive a lump-sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '17 EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.05, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. To be clear, all the guidance we are providing today excludes the potential impact of this pension payout offer. Further, we plan to present adjusted results in the third quarter that will exclude its potential impact. 
Moving on. As Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect our above-plan second quarter. We now expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.43, which would be up 2% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As a reminder, our plans assume a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We are also raising our full year comp sales guidance given our above-plan sales in the second quarter. We now expect a comp increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis in fiscal '17. 
For the year, pretax profit margin is planned to be in the 11.2% to 11.3% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.6% to 28.7% versus 28.8% last year. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 17.3% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $48 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 665 million. 
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 3% on sales of $20.9 billion to $21 billion. Additionally, we now expect segment profit margin to be in a range of 13.9% to 14.0%. For the second half of fiscal 2017, we are now planning Marmaxx's average ticket to decrease slightly versus last year. The balance of our merchandise mix and our values are clearly resonating with customers and consumers, and we plan to continue with our strategies. As always, we are all about great product and our value gap with traditional retailers. 
Importantly, despite the expected decrease in average ticket, we're still looking for merchandise margins to increase. At HomeGoods, we continue to expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in a range of 13.1% to 13.3%. 
At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 7% to 8% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.5% to 13.6%. 
At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.5% to 5.6%. 
Now to Q3 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85 versus last year's $0.86 per share. The guidance assumes an expected negative impact EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling third quarter consolidated sales of $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX. 
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Third quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.9% to 11.1% range versus 12.1% last year. We're anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.9% to 29.0% versus 29.0% last year. This assumes an increase in merchandise margins offset by continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and costs associated with opening new distribution centers to support our growth. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.7% to 17.8% range versus 16.7% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $11 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 663 million. 
Our third quarter and full year guidance implies a fourth quarter comp increase of 1% to 2% and EPS of $0.98 to $1. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the wobbles at the beginning of the third quarter. 
Before we start Q&A, I want to remind you of some of the potential headwinds we are facing in fiscal '18 based on what we know today. We plan to provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call, but we wanted to review these few points as we've heard a lot of questions on them. 
First, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact to EPS growth next year as we are planning this year, so about 3%. Further, we anticipate that wage pressures will continue to be on fiscal '18. Second, while foreign exchange is an unknown today, at current rates, we would expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to continue to have a negative impact to margins and EPS growth next year. Finally, in fiscal '18, we plan to continue our investments in our IT system, supply chain and new seeds to support our growth goals. Again, we'll provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call. 
Wrapping up, to reiterate what Ernie said, we feel great about our business and our opportunities for the back half of the year. We believe our increases in traffic, sales and merchandise margins are all indicators of the fundamental strength of our business. We continue to make important investments in the business and fund new seeds that we are convinced would help us gain market share in the short and long term. We're extremely excited about the future of TJX.

I may not be remembering correctly, but I thought last year, we've started to see the AUR decline in the second quarter. And it sounds like from your comments today anniversary-ing that, there are some incremental AUR declines. In May, when we talked about this, you indicated that the buyers are seeing really nice opportunities to actually fortify the assortment at the opening price point across categories, and that's really been the driver. So is that still the driver here going into year 2, if I'm remembering that correctly? And are there some incremental opportunities that the buyers are seeing out there across categories?"

That's kind of yes, we discussed that really over the last year. There's been a lot of dynamics going on there. I would say that the average ticket situation has really been a combination and continues to be a combination. It isn't just the buying better value. It's also a tweaking of the mix across some departments. So some categories have been emphasized while others deemphasized and some departments. It so happens that in some of those areas, the average ticket is lower. And since we have brought them up driven, and I think we did talk about that before as well with you guys, we don't top-down manage our process. The buyers really drive the bust on that. And so what happens is some of our other businesses and that are trending happened to have lower average ticket. And as we chase them, that lowers the total average ticket in the store down. Having said that, it has moderated from where we were a year ago, and we actually thought at this point, we'd be a little bit more moderated, but it still -- it is still leveling off from where it was 6 months ago. So we're pretty happy with that. To your second question about the opportunities out there, and I guess, you're getting out just in general, right?

So we just right now, I would say have had to be very diligent on the holding back our buyers and not buying too soon. We always have to do that. I would say that we probably had a ramp that effort up a little more strongly than we have in the past only because of the environment out there is yielding a little bit more than we typically would see, especially at this time period. Right now, it's not exactly the time period you would see so much, but there is quite a bit about there. So yes, a lot of opportunities in it not one area, not one price zone, not light, moderate or better, a little bit across the board. And so one thing we've strategically done is we leaned up our inventories to more of a flat level so that we could take advantage of this marketplace. Because the marketplace is so flushed with goods, we thought it was a good time to actually lean up our inventories a little bit more than we had been running. So that's one reason you saw a little shift there where even a little bit more liquid than we were 3 months or 6 months ago."

Gift-giving is like we often say, we are poised strategically, and this is something we've looked at in all of the 4 major divisions. We're poised to do a better job from -- I can't give you any specifics, but what I could say is from a how about this, for any merchandise mix perspective, on a marketing front as well as store execution. Because we have worked at all 3 of those factors and try to become more of a gift-giving destination. So years ago, you would -- as you would probably guess, T.J. Maxx maybe was not the coolest gift from. We are now today very cool to buy a holiday gift from. And our marketing programs have really helped to that. The merchandise mix. The other thing we've done is because our supply chain is a better executed supply chain, we can turn goods around faster. So we have a lot of last-minute buys that now we can sprinkle in and get pre-Christmas that we weren't able to do before. So that's something we talked about to you, but I think sometimes we forget to mention it again. So in addition to the strategic gift-giving marketing and store setup that we do and merchandise mix that this year we have some more, I would say fashion categories that I think are going to be great impulse buys I think for the consumers. We're going to also have the quick turnaround from the market closer in unpredictable buys I think will create just a more exciting fourth quarter business. And what I just said to you applies to all 4 divisions. And so I think I touch I was saying I think I touched alone on the in-store execution, but the look at that is clearly and that's why it was in my script. We look at that -- first of all, we talk a lot about the merchants. Our store operators are fantastic, and we have some extremely talented associates in our store operating divisions across all of our companies. And that has become a place, and I think with the cool factor people shopping us is the way we execute our stores, and it's brought in younger customers and more excitement. And that yes, merchandise is certainly a high priority, but that has been right there within terms if I think driving top line and increasing market share."

So when we continue to expand our vendor portfolio and as you do that, you're going to find more goods. So that is one of the things we would attribute to is our desire to always open new vendors, which that's a little contrary to other models of retail. And the other models of retail, by the way, are doing their our model functions on a treasure hunter approach and a very shallow, assorted, eclectic mix. And with that comes a desire to open thousands of vendors. And when you do that, there's tends to be even more availability of goods."

We talked many times I think Scott's actually given you some of information on that a few times in the past.

Maxx or HomeGoods or Marmaxx customer. Both have been growing, and we are very, very happy with the growing of our credit card program, which we are adding more active significantly more active members. We can't give you the number, but significantly more every year. And obviously, we get additional spending from those consumers. When you go to Canada, they do not have a credit card loyalty program, but they do have a noncredit card loyalty program, which is also doing very, very well. And in the U.K., we are testing loyalty program at this point as we speak. So that kind of very early in the process. And when you ask what is our vision is to continue to do this in the model of our business because we don't want to do anything that gets how do I put it?

We're not going to be the same as same rate going to be the same level but the 3 major pieces being wage being the biggest one, which is similar we're not saying it's going to go down in future years which is nothing happens it might moderate going past next year. But at the moment, we just called it out because it's approximately at the same rate at this year. The second piece being foreign exchange, that's why we called again at the moment, it would not be at the impact of this year's impact of 3%. But it's still would be low single digits so we just wanted to call that out. So again, hopeful that will moderate at some point will be a tailwind. Right now, it's a headwind. The third piece is the investment to support our growth again primarily the distribution centers, which has been a bit lumpy as I think we try to explained before because we do not plan to a high level of comps we've experienced in some of our businesses forcing us to move forward, make sure we continue to gain all the market share we've gained. So it will -- bills will still impact us going forward, but we think will moderate those systems and our distribution spend as we move forward in future years. But still going to impact us at least going forward for next year at a similar rate. And so those are 3 big components, so I don't think anything has changed. hopefully, they'll start to moderate going forward."

Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our second quarter results. Consolidated comp store sales grew a strong 4% over a 6% increase last year and above our plan. This marks the 30th consecutive quarter of comp growth for TJX. We are thrilled that the comp was once again driven almost entirely by customer traffic. This is also the seventh consecutive quarter that traffic was the primary driver of our comp increase. In addition, it was great to see that traffic was the primary driver of the comp increases at all 4 major divisions as our great brands, amazing values and eclectic merchandise mix keep resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are attracting new customers, driving more frequent visits to our stores and gaining market share. 
Further, we are pleased with the strong performance across our apparel areas, including accessories and home businesses. Earnings per share increased 5%, well above our expectations and over strong increase last year. We achieved these results despite significant headwinds from wage increases and investments to support our growth. 
Further, we were extremely pleased with our strong merchandise margin increase despite a significant impact from transactional foreign exchange. Our results once again demonstrate the power of our flexible business model and our ability to execute across many different retail environments. 
With our strong second quarter performance, we are raising our full year comp and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, the third quarter is off to a solid start, and we have many initiatives planned for the back half of the year to keep driving traffic and sales. We are confident we will achieve our goals and as always, our management team will strive to surpass them. We see many near- and long-term opportunities for growth and are well on our way to growing TJX to a $40 billion-plus company. 
Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter numbers."
306688,378672104,1036015,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.

As Ernie mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over last year's 6% growth, which was above our plan. I wanted to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division again this quarter. It was also great to see an increase in our units sold for another consecutive quarter. Average ticket decreased slightly more than planned. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.84, a 5% increase over last year's $0.80 and well above our plan. As expected, our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to wage increases. The impact of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange had a neutral impact to EPS growth versus our expectation of a 2% negative impact. Consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.6%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.4%, up 30 basis points versus last year and significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to a strong increase in merchandise margins and gains on our inventory hedges. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had planned. 
At the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were flat on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased with our lean inventory position entering the third quarter as we are set up extremely well to flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the back half of the year. 
Now to recap our second quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a strong 4% this quarter on top of last year's 4% increase. Once again, it was terrific to see customer traffic as the primary driver of the comp increase. We continue to see a decrease in average ticket and significant increase in units sold. We are pleased that our merchandise mix and values remain a great draw for customers, which tells us that our strategies to balance the mix are -- and offer even better values are working. Segment profit margin decreased 30 basis points as our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with a lower average ticket. We are very pleased with the comp and traffic momentum at our largest division and had many initiatives planned to keep gaining market share. 
HomeGoods delivered another great quarter, with comps increasing 5% over last year's 9% growth. Segment profit margin was up 50 basis points due to an extremely strong increase in merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact in HomeGoods margin. Separately, to support the long-term growth potential of this chain, we opened a new distribution center in Tucson, Arizona in the second quarter. As a reminder, we see the potential to expand HomeGoods to be 1,000-store chain, nearly double its current size. 
At TJX Canada's -- at TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 9% this quarter, over last year's 12% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 150 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to the negative impact at the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had on merchandise margins. That said, we're very pleased with the sharp execution of our Canadian organization, which mitigated some of this pressure. TJX's Canada's margins were also impacted by an increased -- by increased supply chain cost as we opened a new distribution center to support this country's future growth. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we have seen across all 3 of our Canadian chains. 
TJX International's comps were up 2% over a 5% increase last year. While sales in the U.K. were slightly lower than we planned, our trends leading up to the Brexit vote were very strong. In addition, we were pleased to perform much better than many major retailers in the U.K. as the Brexit vote weighed on consumers there. We believe we are gaining significant market share in this environment. This speaks to our resiliency and ability to drive sales even in challenging times. 
As a whole, TJX International comps were in line with our plans due to the strong performance of our other European regions. It was also nice to see the benefit of our diversified European store base this quarter. 
Further, as we began the third quarter, comps in the U.K. had been positive. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 260 basis points. This decline was primarily due to a combination of integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business, investments to support growth and wage increases. We feel great about our international growth potential and our many -- and our opportunity to maximize our first-mover advantages in many geographies. 
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the second quarter, we bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first half of the year, we have retired 10.2 million shares, buying back $775 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our third quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."

I'll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe these strengths not only differentiate T.J.

I'll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe these strengths not only differentiate T.J. Maxx -- TJX from most other major retailers, but also position us for continued success, particularly in today's retail environment. 
First, we are a global sourcing machine. Our world-class buying organization has more than 1,000 associates seeking the best merchandise from the universe of more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. We are extremely proud of the depth, experience and longevity of our buying teams, which we are convinced, is a major TJX advantage. 
Second, our global supply chain distribution network and proprietary systems have been built and refined to support our global off-price business model. The flexibility of our global infrastructure allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores and respond rapidly to changing consumer and market trends. We believe this is a key advantage in any retail environment. 
Next, we are leveraging our global presence and expertise. Our 4 major divisions operate as 1 TJX across 9 countries and 3 continents, and are highly integrated and synergistic. We have a culture where associates are encouraged to share ideas, initiatives and best practices that can be leveraged across our businesses. All of these factors that differentiate TJX enable us to deliver amazing value to consumers. Value has been the mission of our company since day 1. We are confident that offering consumers quality branded merchandise at great values will continue to attract more U.S. and international shoppers to our stores. 
Now I'll briefly recap our 3 major growth drivers. Our #1 initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. Our results tell us that our strategies and initiatives are working. We are even more excited about the opportunity we see to capture additional market share in the U.S. and internationally. While e-commerce represents a very small percentage of our overall sales, we see it as a complement to our physical location and another way to drive incremental sales and traffic. 
Next, is our enormous global growth -- store growth potential. With nearly 3,700 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. This includes nearly 1,400 more stores in North America and over 500 additional stores in Europe and Australia. This reflects the opportunity we see with just our current chains in just our current markets alone, and that's before contemplating the potential to expand into new countries or open new chains in existing markets. 
Our third major growth driver is new seeds in innovation. We are always new ideas and initiatives across the company that could lead to new categories or meaningful drivers of future growth. I am convinced that our constant focus on innovation will keep us differentiated from the rest of the retail world. To support our goals for growth, we continue to make significant investments in the business. We are investing where we believe we can capitalize on our first-mover advantages and build upon our leadership positions around the world. While we expect our investments in new seeds, IT systems, supply chain, including distribution centers and talent to impact our EPS growth in the short term, we are confident that they will allow us to gain additional market share in the long term. 
Now I'll spend a moment on our opportunities for the back half of the year. First, we have many exciting gift-giving initiatives planned for the holiday season. Every year, our goal is to be even better than the year before. We'll be offering amazing gift selections from around the world, all at exciting values and shipping them throughout the holiday season. I believe all these factors will be a major differentiator for our -- for all of our retail brands this holiday season. 
Second, I'm very excited about our marketing strategy for the back half. We feel very good about our fall creative campaigns. And during the holiday season, we will be rolling out our tri-branding campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. We'll also continue our integrated marketing approach to TV, digital, mobile and social media to engage a wide shopper demographic. 
Third, to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping our brands, we're growing our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. We also continue to be pleased with our pilot program in the U.K. 
Next, every day, we work to upgrade the shopping experience in our stores. Our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division in the second quarter, and we have a number of plans for the back half. We believe our in-store initiatives will make the shopping experience exciting, convenient and extremely positive for consumers during this busy time of year. 
Lastly, we see a marketplace that is loaded with quality-branded goods. We are extremely pleased with the abundance of merchandise available to us for the fall and winter seasons. 
In closing, I am so proud of our organization's excellent performance in the second quarter. Marmaxx, TJX Canada and HomeGoods significantly outperformed their plans, and TJX International proved, once again, the resiliency of our off-price model in challenging times. In today's uncertain environment, both in the U.S. and internationally, the power and flexibility of our off-price model gives me and our entire management team tremendous confidence. TJX is a company that has achieved sales and profit growth through many kinds of retail, economic and political climates. Throughout our history, we have seen time and time again that when we stay focused on execution and we deliver compelling brands, fashion and values to consumers, we succeed. 
I am convinced we are gaining market share, and I am excited about our opportunities for the second half of the year. We remain laser-focused on driving traffic and sales across all divisions. Our management team is committed to achieving our plans, and we are passionate about surpassing them. I'm very confident that we have the people and strategy in place to successfully achieve our goals for the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."

Before I begin, I wanted to -- I want to briefly talk to the implication of Brexit for us going forward. We continue to monitor the situation very closely, including how we may need to adapt to comply with potential changes such as new regulations or requirements. We remain as confident as ever in the strength and growth prospects of our European business. Further, we are convinced that the flexibility of our business model will continue to serve us well and allow us to gain market share and capitalize on the off-price buying opportunities that disruptions in the marketplace tend to create. 
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. As we stated in our press release this morning, we recently offered eligible former TJX associates, who have not yet commenced their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump-sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '17 EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.05, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. To be clear, all the guidance we are providing today excludes the potential impact of this pension payout offer. Further, we plan to present adjusted results in the third quarter that will exclude its potential impact. 
Moving on. As Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect our above-plan second quarter. We now expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.43, which would be up 2% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As a reminder, our plans assume a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We are also raising our full year comp sales guidance, given our above-plan sales in the second quarter. We now expect a comp increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis in fiscal '17. 
For the year, pretax profit margin is planned to be in the 11.2% to 11.3% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.6% to 28.7% versus 28.8% last year. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 17.3% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $48 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 665 million. 
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 3% on sales of $20.9 billion to $21 billion. Additionally, we now expect 7 -- segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.0%. For the second half of fiscal 2017, we are now planning Marmaxx's average ticket to decrease slightly versus last year. The balance of our merchandise mix and our values are clearly resonating with customers and consumers, and we plan to continue with our strategies. As always, we are all about great product and our value gap with traditional retailers. 
Importantly, despite the expected decrease in average ticket, we're still looking for merchandise margins to increase. At HomeGoods, we continue to expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in a range of 13.1% to 13.3%. 
At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 7% to 8% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.5% to 13.6%. 
At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.5% to 5.6%. 
Now to Q3 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85 versus last year's $0.86 per share. The guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling third quarter consolidated sales of $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX. 
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Third quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.9% to 11.1% range versus 12.1% last year. We're anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.9% to 29.0% versus 29.0% last year. This assumes an increase in merchandise margins offset by continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and costs associated with opening new distribution centers to support our growth. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.7% to 17.8% range versus 16.7% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $11 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 663 million. 
Our third quarter and full year guidance implies a fourth quarter comp increase of 1% to 2% and EPS of $0.98 to $1. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the third quarter. 
Before we start Q&A, I want to remind you of some of the potential headwinds we are facing in fiscal '18 based on what we know today. We plan to provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call, but we wanted to review these few points as we've heard a lot of questions on them. 
First, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact to EPS growth next year as we are planning this year, so about 3%. Further, we anticipate that wage pressures will continue beyond fiscal '18. Second, while foreign exchange is an unknown today, at current rates, we would expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to continue to have a negative impact to margins and EPS growth next year. Finally, in fiscal '18, we plan to continue our investments in our IT system, supply chain and new seeds to support our growth goals. Again, we'll provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call. 
Wrapping up, to reiterate what Ernie said, we feel great about our business and our opportunities for the back half of the year. We believe our increases in traffic, sales and merchandise margins are all indicators of the fundamental strength of our business. We continue to make important investments in the business and fund new seeds that we are convinced will help us gain market share in the short and long term. We are extremely excited about the future of TJX. 
Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions."

I may not be remembering correctly, but I thought last year, we've started to see the AUR decline in the second quarter. And it sounds like from your comments today, anniversary-ing that, there are some incremental AUR declines. In May, when we talked about this, you indicated that the buyers are seeing really nice opportunities to actually fortify the assortment at the opening price point across categories, and that's really been the driver. So is that still the driver here going into year 2, if I'm remembering that correctly? And are there some incremental opportunities that the buyers are seeing out there across categories?"

That's kind of -- yes, we discussed that really over the last year. There's been a lot of dynamics going on there. I would say that the average ticket situation has really been a combination and continues to be a combination. It isn't just the buying better value. It's also a tweaking of the mix across some departments. So some categories have been emphasized while others deemphasized in some departments. And it so happens that in some of those areas, the average ticket is lower. And since we're bottom-up driven, and I think we did talk about that before as well with you guys, we don't top-down manage that process. The buyers really drive the bus on that. And so what happens is some of our other businesses, and that are trending, happen to have lower average ticket. And as we chase them, that lowers the total average ticket in the store down. Having said that, it has moderated from where we were a year ago, and we actually thought at this point, we'd be a little bit more moderated, but it's still -- it is still leveling off from where it was 6 months ago. So we're pretty happy with that. To your second question about the opportunities out there, and I guess, you're getting at just in general, right? Or is that -- you're not just referring to certain opportunities at certain average tickets, right?"

Well, so -- and we kind of put this in the script, and it's something you know we don't like to give too many specifics on, but the markets have an exceptional amount of goods. The markets always have a lot of goods. So we just right now, I would say have had to be very diligent on holding back our buyers and not buying too soon. We always have to do that. I would say that we probably had to ramp that effort up a little more strongly than we have in the past only because of the environment out there is yielding a little bit more than we typically would see, especially at this time period. Right now is not exactly the time period you would see so much, but there is quite a bit out there. So yes, a lot of opportunities. And it's not one area, not one price zone, not one -- not light to moderate or better, a little bit across the board. And so one thing we've strategically done is we leaned up our inventories to more of a flat level so that we could take advantage of this marketplace. Because the marketplace is so flushed with goods, we thought it was a good time to actually lean up our inventories a little bit more than we had been running. So that's one reason you saw a little shift there. We're even a little bit more liquid than we were 3 months or 6 months ago."

We don't like to comment specifically on another retailer or what's going on there. Under our big heading, you heard us talk about gaining market share numerous times throughout our call. That is still our focus. We believe any of the uneasiness that's happening or any of the store closures, not just Macy's, anywhere across the board in this market, and there's been a fair amount announced this year in FY '17, let alone FY '16. And I think it's what you're getting at. We believe there's market share -- additional market share opportunities for us. We don't really watch the actual closing effects as much and what that does in the nearby locations because it's temporary, so we tend to be more long-term oriented. But clearly, there's some uneasiness and some changing dynamics with all of the store closures that are going on domestically and internationally, by the way. So we look at what's happening domestically. And there's far beyond just Macy's. Scott?"

The Macy's stores that they announced last year, the 35 to 40, as Ernie said, just to put this in context, though with -- when we were asked over previous years with other retailers, I'm sure we're getting our fair share from other retailers. But when other retailers' comps have gone up and down, I don't think it's the primary driver of the comp increase that we were getting. But I do think, as Ernie said, there's -- it does portend well for us, not necessarily per se Macy's, but the real estate environment as other retailers both -- as Ernie indicated, both in Europe and the U.S., too.

So that space there, but one of important things that has happened is we talk a lot about our talent and how we've had such a push throughout our company on building talent, a merchant talent, and our buying organization, even in the script today we talked about competitive advantage. We have a team up there who now is really executing, I think, at a high level. And a lot of that is because about 3 years ago, we started putting a full-court press on developing that team and stretching them and putting in the type of training programs and seniority and tenure that we really wanted that we, at the time, did not actually have up there as much as we had in some of our other businesses. So when you have a strong merchant team, which we do up there, merchandising and planning, and its more seasoned now, you start to reap some of the benefits, and I think that's what we were also reaping last year as well as this year.

The other thing we've done is our -- because our supply chain is a better executed supply chain, we can turn goods around faster. So for a holiday, we have a lot of last-minute buys that now we can sprinkle in and get in pre-Christmas that we weren't able to do before. So that has been something we talked about with you, but I think sometimes we forget to mention it again. So in addition to the strategic gift-giving marketing and store setup that we do and merchandise mix that this year we have some more, I would say fashion-oriented categories that I think are going to be great impulse buys, I think, for the consumers. We're going to also have the quick turnaround from the market closer in unpredictable buys that I think will create just a more exciting fourth quarter business. And what I just said to you applies to all 4 divisions. And so I think I touched -- what I was saying, I think I touched a little on the in-store execution, but we look at that is clearly, and that's why it was in my script, we look at the -- first of all, our -- we talk a lot about the merchants. Our store operators are fantastic, and we have some extremely talented associates in our store operating divisions across all of our companies. And that has become a place, and I think it's helped with the cool factor and people shopping us is the way we execute our stores, and it's brought in younger customers and more excitement. And that yes, merchandise is certainly a high priority, but that has been right there with it in terms of, I think, driving top line and increasing market share."

Again, at the moment, it would not be at the impact of this year's impact of 3%. But it still would be low single digits, so we just wanted to call that out. So again, hopefully that will moderate and at some point will be a tailwind. Right now, it's a headwind. The third piece is the investment to support our growth. Again, primarily the distribution centers, and which has been a bit lumpy, as I think we've tried to explain before, because we do not plan the high level of comps we've experienced in some of our businesses forcing us to move forward, make sure we continue to gain all the market share we've gained. So it will -- those will still impact us going forward, but we think will moderate those systems and our distribution spend as we move forward in future years, but still going to impact us at least going forward for next year at a similar rate.

Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our second quarter results. Consolidated comp store sales grew a strong 4% over a 6% increase last year and above our plan. This marks the 30th consecutive quarter of comp growth for TJX. We are thrilled that the comp was once again driven almost entirely by customer traffic. This is also the seventh consecutive quarter that traffic was the primary driver of our comp increase. In addition, it was great to see that traffic was the primary driver of the comp increases at all 4 major divisions as our great brands, amazing values and eclectic merchandise mix keep resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are attracting new customers, driving more frequent visits to our stores and gaining market share. 
Further, we are pleased with the strong performance across our apparel areas, including accessories and home businesses. Earnings per share increased 5%, well above our expectations and over strong increase last year. We achieved these results despite significant headwinds from wage increases and investments to support our growth. 
Further, we were extremely pleased with our strong merchandise margin increase despite a significant impact from transactional foreign exchange. Our results once again demonstrate the power of our flexible business model and our ability to execute across many different retail environments. 
With our strong second quarter performance, we are raising our full year comp and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, the third quarter is off to a solid start, and we have many initiatives planned for the back half of the year to keep driving traffic and sales. We are confident we will achieve our goals and as always, our management team will strive to surpass them. We see many near- and long-term opportunities for growth and are well on our way to growing TJX to a $40 billion-plus company. 
Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter numbers."

As Ernie mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over last year's 6% growth, which was above our plan. I wanted to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division again this quarter. It was also great to see an increase in our units sold for another consecutive quarter. Average ticket decreased slightly more than planned. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.84, a 5% increase over last year's $0.80 and well above our plan. As expected, our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to wage increases. The impact of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange had a neutral impact to EPS growth versus our expectation of a 2% negative impact. Consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.6%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.4%, up 30 basis points versus last year and significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to a strong increase in merchandise margins and gains on our inventory hedges. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had planned. 
At the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were flat on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased with our lean inventory position entering the third quarter as we are set up extremely well to flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the back half of the year. 
Now to recap our second quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a strong 4% this quarter on top of last year's 4% increase. Once again, it was terrific to see customer traffic as the primary driver of the comp increase. We continue to see a decrease in average ticket and significant increase in units sold. We are pleased that our merchandise mix and values remain a great draw for customers, which tells us that our strategies to balance the mix are -- and offer even better values are working. Segment profit margin decreased 30 basis points as our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with a lower average ticket. We are very pleased with the comp and traffic momentum at our largest division and had many initiatives planned to keep gaining market share. 
HomeGoods delivered another great quarter, with comps increasing 5% over last year's 9% growth. Segment profit margin was up 50 basis points due to an extremely strong increase in merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact in HomeGoods margin. Separately, to support the long-term growth potential of this chain, we opened a new distribution center in Tucson, Arizona in the second quarter. As a reminder, we see the potential to expand HomeGoods to be a 1,000-store chain, nearly double its current size. 
At TJX Canada's -- at TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 9% this quarter, over last year's 12% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 150 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to the negative impact at the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had on merchandise margins. That said, we're very pleased with the sharp execution of our Canadian organization, which mitigated some of this pressure. TJX's Canada's margins were also impacted by an increased -- by increased supply chain cost as we opened a new distribution center to support this country's future growth. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we have seen across all 3 of our Canadian chains. 
TJX International's comps were up 2% over a 5% increase last year. While sales in the U.K. were slightly lower than we planned, our trends leading up to the Brexit vote were very strong. In addition, we were pleased to perform much better than many major retailers in the U.K. as the Brexit vote weighed on consumers there. We believe we are gaining significant market share in this environment. This speaks to our resiliency and ability to drive sales even in challenging times. 
As a whole, TJX International comps were in line with our plans due to the strong performance of our other European regions. It was also nice to see the benefit of our diversified European store base this quarter. 
Further, as we began the third quarter, comps in the U.K. had been positive. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 260 basis points. This decline was primarily due to a combination of integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business, investments to support growth and wage increases. We feel great about our international growth potential and our many -- and our opportunity to maximize our first-mover advantages in many geographies. 
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the second quarter, we bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first half of the year, we have retired 10.2 million shares, buying back $775 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our third quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,378672104,1036055,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2016",2016-08-16,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe these strengths not only differentiate T.J.

I'll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe these strengths not only differentiate T.J. Maxx -- TJX from most other major retailers, but also position us for continued success, particularly in today's retail environment. 
First, we are a global sourcing machine. Our world-class buying organization has more than 1,000 associates seeking the best merchandise from the universe of more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. We are extremely proud of the depth, experience and longevity of our buying teams, which we are convinced, is a major TJX advantage. 
Second, our global supply chain distribution network and proprietary systems have been built and refined to support our global off-price business model. The flexibility of our global infrastructure allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores and respond rapidly to changing consumer and market trends. We believe this is a key advantage in any retail environment. 
Next, we are leveraging our global presence and expertise. Our 4 major divisions operate as 1 TJX across 9 countries and 3 continents, and are highly integrated and synergistic. We have a culture where associates are encouraged to share ideas, initiatives and best practices that can be leveraged across our businesses. All of these factors that differentiate TJX enable us to deliver amazing value to consumers. Value has been the mission of our company since day 1. We are confident that offering consumers quality branded merchandise at great values will continue to attract more U.S. and international shoppers to our stores. 
Now I'll briefly recap our 3 major growth drivers. Our #1 initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. Our results tell us that our strategies and initiatives are working. We are even more excited about the opportunity we see to capture additional market share in the U.S. and internationally. While e-commerce represents a very small percentage of our overall sales, we see it as a complement to our physical location and another way to drive incremental sales and traffic. 
Next, is our enormous global growth -- store growth potential. With nearly 3,700 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. This includes nearly 1,400 more stores in North America and over 500 additional stores in Europe and Australia. This reflects the opportunity we see with just our current chains in just our current markets alone, and that's before contemplating the potential to expand into new countries or open new chains in existing markets. 
Our third major growth driver is new seeds and innovation. We are always testing new ideas and initiatives across the company that could lead to new categories or meaningful drivers of future growth. I am convinced that our constant focus on innovation will keep us differentiated from the rest of the retail world. To support our goals for growth, we continue to make significant investments in the business. We are investing where we believe we can capitalize on our first-mover advantages and build upon our leadership positions around the world. While we expect our investments in new seeds, IT systems, supply chain, including distribution centers and talent to impact our EPS growth in the short term, we are confident that they will allow us to gain additional market share in the long term. 
Now I'll spend a moment on our opportunities for the back half of the year. First, we have many exciting gift-giving initiatives planned for the holiday season. Every year, our goal is to be even better than the year before. We'll be offering amazing gift selections from around the world, all at exciting values and shipping them throughout the holiday season. I believe all these factors will be a major differentiator for our -- for all of our retail brands this holiday season. 
Second, I'm very excited about our marketing strategy for the back half. We feel very good about our fall creative campaigns. And during the holiday season, we will be rolling out our tri-branding campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. We'll also continue our integrated marketing approach through TV, digital, mobile and social media to engage a wide shopper demographic. 
Third, to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping our brands, we're growing our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. We also continue to be pleased with our pilot program in the U.K. 
Next, every day, we work to upgrade the shopping experience in our stores. Our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division in the second quarter, and we have a number of plans for the back half. We believe our in-store initiatives will make the shopping experience exciting, convenient and extremely positive for consumers during this busy time of year. 
Lastly, we see a marketplace that is loaded with quality-branded goods. We are extremely pleased with the abundance of merchandise available to us for the fall and winter seasons. 
In closing, I am so proud of our organization's excellent performance in the second quarter. Marmaxx, TJX Canada and HomeGoods significantly outperformed their plans, and TJX International proved, once again, the resiliency of our off-price model in challenging times. In today's uncertain environment, both in the U.S. and internationally, the power and flexibility of our off-price model gives me and our entire management team tremendous confidence. TJX is a company that has achieved sales and profit growth through many kinds of retail, economic and political climates. Throughout our history, we have seen time and time again that when we stay focused on execution and we deliver compelling brands, fashion and values to consumers, we succeed. 
I am convinced we are gaining market share, and I am excited about our opportunities for the second half of the year. We remain laser-focused on driving traffic and sales across all divisions. Our management team is committed to achieving our plans, and we are passionate about surpassing them. I'm very confident that we have the people and strategy in place to successfully achieve our goals for the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."

Before I begin, I wanted to -- I want to briefly talk to the implication of Brexit for us going forward. We continue to monitor the situation very closely, including how we may need to adapt to comply with potential changes such as new regulations or requirements. We remain as confident as ever in the strength and growth prospects of our European business. Further, we are convinced that the flexibility of our business model will continue to serve us well and allow us to gain market share and capitalize on the off-price buying opportunities that disruptions in the marketplace tend to create. 
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. As we stated in our press release this morning, we recently offered eligible former TJX associates, who have not yet commenced their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump-sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '17 EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.05, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. To be clear, all the guidance we are providing today excludes the potential impact of this pension payout offer. Further, we plan to present adjusted results in the third quarter that will exclude its potential impact. 
Moving on. As Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect our above-plan second quarter. We now expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.43, which would be up 2% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As a reminder, our plans assume a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We are also raising our full year comp sales guidance, given our above-plan sales in the second quarter. We now expect a comp increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis in fiscal '17. 
For the year, pretax profit margin is planned to be in the 11.2% to 11.3% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.6% to 28.7% versus 28.8% last year. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 17.3% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $48 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 665 million. 
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 3% on sales of $20.9 billion to $21 billion. Additionally, we now expect 7 -- segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.0%. For the second half of fiscal 2017, we are now planning Marmaxx's average ticket to decrease slightly versus last year. The balance of our merchandise mix and our values are clearly resonating with customers and consumers, and we plan to continue with our strategies. As always, we are all about great product and our value gap with traditional retailers. 
Importantly, despite the expected decrease in average ticket, we're still looking for merchandise margins to increase. At HomeGoods, we continue to expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in a range of 13.1% to 13.3%. 
At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 7% to 8% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.5% to 13.6%. 
At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.5% to 5.6%. 
Now to Q3 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85 versus last year's $0.86 per share. The guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling third quarter consolidated sales of $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX. 
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Third quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.9% to 11.1% range versus 12.1% last year. We're anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.9% to 29.0% versus 29.0% last year. This assumes an increase in merchandise margins offset by continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and costs associated with opening new distribution centers to support our growth. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.7% to 17.8% range versus 16.7% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $11 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 663 million. 
Our third quarter and full year guidance implies a fourth quarter comp increase of 1% to 2% and EPS of $0.98 to $1. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the third quarter. 
Before we start Q&A, I want to remind you of some of the potential headwinds we are facing in fiscal '18 based on what we know today. We plan to provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call, but we wanted to review these few points as we've heard a lot of questions on them. 
First, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact to EPS growth next year as we are planning this year, so about 3%. Further, we anticipate that wage pressures will continue beyond fiscal '18. Second, while foreign exchange is an unknown today, at current rates, we would expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to continue to have a negative impact to margins and EPS growth next year. Finally, in fiscal '18, we plan to continue our investments in our IT system, supply chain and new seeds to support our growth goals. Again, we'll provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call. 
Wrapping up, to reiterate what Ernie said, we feel great about our business and our opportunities for the back half of the year. We believe our increases in traffic, sales and merchandise margins are all indicators of the fundamental strength of our business. We continue to make important investments in the business and fund new seeds that we are convinced will help us gain market share in the short and long term. We are extremely excited about the future of TJX. 
Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions."

I may not be remembering correctly, but I thought last year, we've started to see the AUR decline in the second quarter. And it sounds like from your comments today, anniversary-ing that, there are some incremental AUR declines. In May, when we talked about this, you indicated that the buyers are seeing really nice opportunities to actually fortify the assortment at the opening price point across categories, and that's really been the driver. So is that still the driver here going into year 2, if I'm remembering that correctly? And are there some incremental opportunities that the buyers are seeing out there across categories?"

That's kind of -- yes, we discussed that really over the last year. There's been a lot of dynamics going on there. I would say that the average ticket situation has really been a combination and continues to be a combination. It isn't just the buying better value. It's also a tweaking of the mix across some departments. So some categories have been emphasized while others deemphasized in some departments. And it so happens that in some of those areas, the average ticket is lower. And since we're bottom-up driven, and I think we did talk about that before as well with you guys, we don't top-down manage that process. The buyers really drive the bus on that. And so what happens is some of our hotter businesses, and that are trending, happen to have lower average ticket. And as we chase them, that lowers the total average ticket in the store down. Having said that, it has moderated from where we were a year ago, and we actually thought at this point, we'd be a little bit more moderated, but it's still -- it is still leveling off from where it was 6 months ago. So we're pretty happy with that. To your second question about the opportunities out there, and I guess, you're getting at just in general, right? Or is that -- you're not just referring to certain opportunities at certain average tickets, right?"

Well, so -- and we kind of put this in the script, and it's something you know we don't like to give too many specifics on, but the markets have an exceptional amount of goods. The markets always have a lot of goods. So we just right now, I would say have had to be very diligent on holding back our buyers and not buying too soon. We always have to do that. I would say that we probably had to ramp that effort up a little more strongly than we have in the past only because of the environment out there is yielding a little bit more than we typically would see, especially at this time period. Right now is not exactly the time period you would see so much, but there is quite a bit out there. So yes, a lot of opportunities. And it's not one area, not one price zone, not one -- not like moderate or better, a little bit across the board. And so one thing we've strategically done is we leaned up our inventories to more of a flat level so that we could take advantage of this marketplace. Because the marketplace is so flushed with goods, we thought it was a good time to actually lean up our inventories a little bit more than we had been running. So that's one reason you saw a little shift there. We're even a little bit more liquid than we were 3 months or 6 months ago."

And then secondly, in our second quarter, because Europe is a piece of our business, we probably would have been a point higher in comp if Europe was more normalized. So if you take into account the pre-Brexit trend we had versus post, we would have been, and Scott is running the numbers, we would have been a 5%. But I don't know if that answers you.

It doesn't mean we will raise retails on like-for-like items because we say it's an opportunity to show we've been better at value and passing on to the consumer.

So that stays there, but one of important things that has happened is we talk a lot about our talent and how we've had such a push throughout our company on building talent, a merchant talent, and our buying organization, even in the script today we talked about competitive advantage. We have a team up there who now is really executing, I think, at a high level. And a lot of that is because about 3 years ago, we started putting a full-court press on developing that team and stretching them and putting in the type of training programs and seniority and tenure that we really wanted that we, at the time, did not actually have up there as much as we had in some of our other businesses. So when you have a strong merchant team, which we do up there, merchandising and planning, and it's more seasoned now, you start to reap some of the benefits, and I think that's what we were also reaping last year as well as this year.

Gift-giving is like we often say, we are poised strategically, and this is something we've looked at in all of the 4 major divisions. We're poised to do a better job from -- I can't give you any specifics, but what I could say is from a -- how about this, for a merchandise mix perspective, on a marketing front as well as store execution. Because we have worked at all 3 of those factors and try to become more of a gift-giving destination. So years ago, you would -- as you would probably guess, T.J. Maxx maybe was not the coolest gift from. We are now today a very cool place to buy a holiday gift from. And our marketing programs have really helped with that, the merchandise mix. The other thing we've done is our -- because our supply chain is a better executed supply chain, we can turn goods around faster. So for a holiday, we have a lot of last-minute buys that now we can sprinkle in and get in pre-Christmas that we weren't able to do before. So that has been something we talked about with you, but I think sometimes we forget to mention it again. So in addition to the strategic gift-giving marketing and store setup that we do and merchandise mix that this year we have some more, I would say fashion-oriented categories that I think are going to be great impulse buys, I think, for the consumers. We're going to also have the quick turnaround from the market closer in unpredictable buys that I think will create just a more exciting fourth quarter business. And what I just said to you applies to all 4 divisions. And so I think I touched -- what I was saying, I think I touched a little on the in-store execution, but we look at that is clearly, and that's why it was in my script, we look at the -- first of all, our -- we talk a lot about the merchants. Our store operators are fantastic, and we have some extremely talented associates in our store operating divisions across all of our companies. And that has become a place, and I think it's helped with the cool factor and people shopping us is the way we execute our stores, and it's brought in younger customers and more excitement. And that yes, merchandise is certainly a high priority, but that has been right there with it in terms of, I think, driving top line and increasing market share."

So I don't know if that answers your question."

So let me give you the internal versus the -- so the external, we all know the retail environment is a little tough, but there's always new vendors opening. So the thing you have to keep in mind that I think is easy to forget is we actually are up to about 18,000 vendors now that we deal with. So when you -- we continue to expand our vendor portfolio. And as you do that, you're going to find more goods. So that is one of the things we would attribute to, is our desire to always open new vendors, which that's a little contrary to other models of retail. And the other models of retail, by the way, are doing the right thing for their model of retail. Our model functions on a treasure hunter approach in a very shallow, assorted, eclectic mix. And with that comes a desire to open thousands of vendors. And when you do that, there's tends to be even more availability of goods."

And we are very, very happy with the growing of our credit card program, which we are adding more active -- significantly more active members. We can't give you the number, but significantly more every year. And obviously, we get additional spending from those consumers. When you go to Canada, they do not have a credit card loyalty program, but they do have a noncredit card loyalty program, which is also doing very, very well. And in the U.K., we are testing a loyalty program at this point -- as we speak. So that kind of very early in the process. And when you ask what is our -- our vision is to continue to do this in the model of our business, because we don't want to do anything that gets -- how would I put it? Gimmicky or promotional out of the loyalty program, which some retailers use it to, every now and then, do coupons, et cetera. So that is not a route we will take.

Again, at the moment, it would not be at the impact of this year's impact of 3%. But it still would be low single digits, so we just wanted to call that out. So again, hopefully that will moderate and at some point will be a tailwind. Right now, it's a headwind. The third piece is the investment to support our growth. Again, primarily the distribution centers, and which has been a bit lumpy, as I think we've tried to explain before, because we do not plan the high level of comps we've experienced in some of our businesses forcing us to move forward, make sure we continue to gain all the market share we've gained. So it will -- those will still impact us going forward, but we think will moderate those systems and our distribution spend as we move forward in future years, but still going to impact us at least going forward for next year at a similar rate.

Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our second quarter results. Consolidated comp store sales grew a strong 4% over a 6% increase last year and above our plan. This marks the 30th consecutive quarter of comp growth for TJX. We are thrilled that the comp was once again driven almost entirely by customer traffic. This is also the seventh consecutive quarter that traffic was the primary driver of our comp increase. In addition, it was great to see that traffic was the primary driver of the comp increases at all 4 major divisions as our great brands, amazing values and eclectic merchandise mix keep resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are attracting new customers, driving more frequent visits to our stores and gaining market share. 
Further, we are pleased with the strong performance across our apparel areas, including accessories and home businesses. Earnings per share increased 5%, well above our expectations and over strong increase last year. We achieved these results despite significant headwinds from wage increases and investments to support our growth. 
Further, we were extremely pleased with our strong merchandise margin increase despite a significant impact from transactional foreign exchange. Our results once again demonstrate the power of our flexible business model and our ability to execute across many different retail environments. 
With our strong second quarter performance, we are raising our full year comp and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, the third quarter is off to a solid start, and we have many initiatives planned for the back half of the year to keep driving traffic and sales. We are confident we will achieve our goals and as always, our management team will strive to surpass them. We see many near- and long-term opportunities for growth and are well on our way to growing TJX to a $40 billion-plus company. 
Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter numbers."

As Ernie mentioned, our second quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased 4% over last year's 6% growth, which was above our plan. I wanted to note that this reflects the comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores and excludes our e-commerce businesses. We were very pleased that customer traffic was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division again this quarter. It was also great to see an increase in our units sold for another consecutive quarter. Average ticket decreased slightly more than planned. 
Diluted earnings per share were $0.84, a 5% increase over last year's $0.80 and well above our plan. As expected, our EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately 3% due to wage increases. The impact of foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange had a neutral impact to EPS growth versus our expectation of a 2% negative impact. Consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.6%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.4%, up 30 basis points versus last year and significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to a strong increase in merchandise margins and gains on our inventory hedges. 
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had planned. 
At the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were flat on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased with our lean inventory position entering the third quarter as we are set up extremely well to flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the back half of the year. 
Now to recap our second quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a strong 4% this quarter on top of last year's 4% increase. Once again, it was terrific to see customer traffic as the primary driver of the comp increase. We continue to see a decrease in average ticket and significant increase in units sold. We are pleased that our merchandise mix and values remain a great draw for customers, which tells us that our strategies to balance the mix are -- and offer even better values are working. Segment profit margin decreased 30 basis points as our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with a lower average ticket. We are very pleased with the comp and traffic momentum at our largest division and had many initiatives planned to keep gaining market share. 
HomeGoods delivered another great quarter, with comps increasing 5% over last year's 9% growth. Segment profit margin was up 50 basis points due to an extremely strong increase in merchandise margins. As we anticipated, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact in HomeGoods margin. Separately, to support the long-term growth potential of this chain, we opened a new distribution center in Tucson, Arizona in the second quarter. As a reminder, we see the potential to expand HomeGoods to be a 1,000-store chain, nearly double its current size. 
At TJX Canada's -- at TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 9% this quarter, over last year's 12% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 150 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to the negative impact at the year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar had on merchandise margins. That said, we're very pleased with the sharp execution of our Canadian organization, which mitigated some of this pressure. TJX's Canada's margins were also impacted by an increased -- by increased supply chain cost as we opened a new distribution center to support this country's future growth. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we have seen across all 3 of our Canadian chains. 
TJX International's comps were up 2% over a 5% increase last year. While sales in the U.K. were slightly lower than we planned, our trends leading up to the Brexit vote were very strong. In addition, we were pleased to perform much better than many major retailers in the U.K. as the Brexit vote weighed on consumers there. We believe we are gaining significant market share in this environment. This speaks to our resiliency and ability to drive sales even in challenging times. 
As a whole, TJX International comps were in line with our plans due to the strong performance of our other European regions. It was also nice to see the benefit of our diversified European store base this quarter. 
Further, as we began the third quarter, comps in the U.K. had been positive. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 260 basis points. This decline was primarily due to a combination of integrating Trade Secret in Australia into our business, investments to support growth and wage increases. We feel great about our international growth potential and our many -- and our opportunity to maximize our first-mover advantages in many geographies. 
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the second quarter, we bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first half of the year, we have retired 10.2 million shares, buying back $775 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year. 
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our third quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."

I'll begin by reiterating our key strengths, which give us great confidence. We believe these strengths not only differentiate T.J. Maxx -- TJX from most other major retailers, but also position us for continued success, particularly in today's retail environment. 
First, we are a global sourcing machine. Our world-class buying organization has more than 1,000 associates seeking the best merchandise from the universe of more than 18,000 vendors in over 100 countries. We are extremely proud of the depth, experience and longevity of our buying teams, which we are convinced, is a major TJX advantage. 
Second, our global supply chain distribution network and proprietary systems have been built and refined to support our global off-price business model. The flexibility of our global infrastructure allows us to adjust the merchandise flow to our stores and respond rapidly to changing consumer and market trends. We believe this is a key advantage in any retail environment. 
Next, we are leveraging our global presence and expertise. Our 4 major divisions operate as 1 TJX across 9 countries and 3 continents, and are highly integrated and synergistic. We have a culture where associates are encouraged to share ideas, initiatives and best practices that can be leveraged across our businesses. All of these factors that differentiate TJX enable us to deliver amazing value to consumers. Value has been the mission of our company since day 1. We are confident that offering consumers quality branded merchandise at great values will continue to attract more U.S. and international shoppers to our stores. 
Now I'll briefly recap our 3 major growth drivers. Our #1 initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. Our results tell us that our strategies and initiatives are working. We are even more excited about the opportunity we see to capture additional market share in the U.S. and internationally. While e-commerce represents a very small percentage of our overall sales, we see it as a complement to our physical location and another way to drive incremental sales and traffic. 
Next, is our enormous global growth -- store growth potential. With nearly 3,700 stores today, we see the opportunity to grow by more than 50% to 5,600 stores long term. This includes nearly 1,400 more stores in North America and over 500 additional stores in Europe and Australia. This reflects the opportunity we see with just our current chains in just our current markets alone, and that's before contemplating the potential to expand into new countries or open new chains in existing markets. 
Our third major growth driver is new seeds and innovation. We are always testing new ideas and initiatives across the company that could lead to new categories or meaningful drivers of future growth. I am convinced that our constant focus on innovation will keep us differentiated from the rest of the retail world. To support our goals for growth, we continue to make significant investments in the business. We are investing where we believe we can capitalize on our first-mover advantages and build upon our leadership positions around the world. While we expect our investments in new seeds, IT systems, supply chain, including distribution centers and talent to impact our EPS growth in the short term, we are confident that they will allow us to gain additional market share in the long term. 
Now I'll spend a moment on our opportunities for the back half of the year. First, we have many exciting gift-giving initiatives planned for the holiday season. Every year, our goal is to be even better than the year before. We'll be offering amazing gift selections from around the world, all at exciting values and shipping them throughout the holiday season. I believe all these factors will be a major differentiator for our -- for all of our retail brands this holiday season. 
Second, I'm very excited about our marketing strategy for the back half. We feel very good about our fall creative campaigns. And during the holiday season, we will be rolling out our tri-branding campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. We'll also continue our integrated marketing approach through TV, digital, mobile and social media to engage a wide shopper demographic. 
Third, to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping our brands, we're growing our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. We also continue to be pleased with our pilot program in the U.K. 
Next, every day, we work to upgrade the shopping experience in our stores. Our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division in the second quarter, and we have a number of plans for the back half. We believe our in-store initiatives will make the shopping experience exciting, convenient and extremely positive for consumers during this busy time of year. 
Lastly, we see a marketplace that is loaded with quality-branded goods. We are extremely pleased with the abundance of merchandise available to us for the fall and winter seasons. 
In closing, I am so proud of our organization's excellent performance in the second quarter. Marmaxx, TJX Canada and HomeGoods significantly outperformed their plans, and TJX International proved, once again, the resiliency of our off-price model in challenging times. In today's uncertain environment, both in the U.S. and internationally, the power and flexibility of our off-price model gives me and our entire management team tremendous confidence. TJX is a company that has achieved sales and profit growth through many kinds of retail, economic and political climates. Throughout our history, we have seen time and time again that when we stay focused on execution and we deliver compelling brands, fashion and values to consumers, we succeed. 
I am convinced we are gaining market share, and I am excited about our opportunities for the second half of the year. We remain laser-focused on driving traffic and sales across all divisions. Our management team is committed to achieving our plans, and we are passionate about surpassing them. I'm very confident that we have the people and strategy in place to successfully achieve our goals for the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."

Before I begin, I wanted to -- I want to briefly talk to the implication of Brexit for us going forward. We continue to monitor the situation very closely, including how we may need to adapt to comply with potential changes such as new regulations or requirements. We remain as confident as ever in the strength and growth prospects of our European business. Further, we are convinced that the flexibility of our business model will continue to serve us well and allow us to gain market share and capitalize on the off-price buying opportunities that disruptions in the marketplace tend to create. 
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the full year. As we stated in our press release this morning, we recently offered eligible former TJX associates, who have not yet commenced their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump-sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '17 EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.05, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. To be clear, all the guidance we are providing today excludes the potential impact of this pension payout offer. Further, we plan to present adjusted results in the third quarter that will exclude its potential impact. 
Moving on. As Ernie mentioned, we are raising our full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect our above-plan second quarter. We now expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.43, which would be up 2% to 3% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. As a reminder, our plans assume a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We are also raising our full year comp sales guidance, given our above-plan sales in the second quarter. We now expect a comp increase of 3% to 4% on a consolidated basis in fiscal '17. 
For the year, pretax profit margin is planned to be in the 11.2% to 11.3% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.6% to 28.7% versus 28.8% last year. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be approximately 17.3% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $48 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 665 million. 
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are planning a comp growth of 3% on sales of $20.9 billion to $21 billion. Additionally, we now expect 7 -- segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.0%. For the second half of fiscal 2017, we are now planning Marmaxx's average ticket to decrease slightly versus last year. The balance of our merchandise mix and our values are clearly resonating with customers and consumers, and we plan to continue with our strategies. As always, we are all about great product and our value gap with traditional retailers. 
Importantly, despite the expected decrease in average ticket, we're still looking for merchandise margins to increase. At HomeGoods, we continue to expect comps to increase 4% to 5% on sales of $4.3 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in a range of 13.1% to 13.3%. 
At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 7% to 8% on sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.5% to 13.6%. 
At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of 2% to 3% on sales of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 5.5% to 5.6%. 
Now to Q3 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85 versus last year's $0.86 per share. The guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling third quarter consolidated sales of $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX. 
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 2% to 3% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Third quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 10.9% to 11.1% range versus 12.1% last year. We're anticipating third quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.9% to 29.0% versus 29.0% last year. This assumes an increase in merchandise margins offset by continued transactional foreign exchange pressure and costs associated with opening new distribution centers to support our growth. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.7% to 17.8% range versus 16.7% last year. This is primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% and net interest expense of about $11 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 663 million. 
Our third quarter and full year guidance implies a fourth quarter comp increase of 1% to 2% and EPS of $0.98 to $1. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the third quarter. 
Before we start Q&A, I want to remind you of some of the potential headwinds we are facing in fiscal '18 based on what we know today. We plan to provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call, but we wanted to review these few points as we've heard a lot of questions on them. 
First, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact to EPS growth next year as we are planning this year, so about 3%. Further, we anticipate that wage pressures will continue beyond fiscal '18. Second, while foreign exchange is an unknown today, at current rates, we would expect foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange to continue to have a negative impact to margins and EPS growth next year. Finally, in fiscal '18, we plan to continue our investments in our IT system, supply chain and new seeds to support our growth goals. Again, we'll provide detailed fiscal '18 guidance on our year-end call. 
Wrapping up, to reiterate what Ernie said, we feel great about our business and our opportunities for the back half of the year. We believe our increases in traffic, sales and merchandise margins are all indicators of the fundamental strength of our business. We continue to make important investments in the business and fund new seeds that we are convinced will help us gain market share in the short and long term. We are extremely excited about the future of TJX. 
Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions."

I may not be remembering correctly, but I thought last year, we've started to see the AUR decline in the second quarter. And it sounds like from your comments today, anniversary-ing that, there are some incremental AUR declines. In May, when we talked about this, you indicated that the buyers are seeing really nice opportunities to actually fortify the assortment at the opening price point across categories, and that's really been the driver. So is that still the driver here going into year 2, if I'm remembering that correctly? And are there some incremental opportunities that the buyers are seeing out there across categories?"

That's kind of -- yes, we discussed that really over the last year. There's been a lot of dynamics going on there. I would say that the average ticket situation has really been a combination and continues to be a combination. It isn't just the buying better value. It's also a tweaking of the mix across some departments. So some categories have been emphasized while others deemphasized in some departments. And it so happens that in some of those areas, the average ticket is lower. And since we're bottom-up driven, and I think we did talk about that before as well with you guys, we don't top-down manage that process. The buyers really drive the bus on that. And so what happens is some of our hotter businesses, and that are trending, happen to have lower average ticket. And as we chase them, that lowers the total average ticket in the store down. Having said that, it has moderated from where we were a year ago, and we actually thought at this point, we'd be a little bit more moderated, but it's still -- it is still leveling off from where it was 6 months ago. So we're pretty happy with that. To your second question about the opportunities out there, and I guess, you're getting at just in general, right? Or is that -- you're not just referring to certain opportunities at certain average tickets, right?"

Well, so -- and we kind of put this in the script, and it's something you know we don't like to give too many specifics on, but the markets have an exceptional amount of goods. The markets always have a lot of goods. So we just right now, I would say have had to be very diligent on holding back our buyers and not buying too soon. We always have to do that. I would say that we probably had to ramp that effort up a little more strongly than we have in the past only because of the environment out there is yielding a little bit more than we typically would see, especially at this time period. Right now is not exactly the time period you would see so much, but there is quite a bit out there. So yes, a lot of opportunities. And it's not one area, not one price zone, not one -- not like moderate or better, a little bit across the board. And so one thing we've strategically done is we leaned up our inventories to more of a flat level so that we could take advantage of this marketplace. Because the marketplace is so flushed with goods, we thought it was a good time to actually lean up our inventories a little bit more than we had been running. So that's one reason you saw a little shift there. We're even a little bit more liquid than we were 3 months or 6 months ago."

I think that's what you were getting at. That's what some of the articles talk to. If the retailers in general, promote less, there is -- for us, that widens the gap. So what's interesting is we look at that as still market share opportunity. And probably a little bit of margin opportunity in that there's still availability out there. It doesn't mean we will raise retails on like-for-like items because we say it's an opportunity to show we've been better at value and passing on to the consumer. So we -- I guess, bottom line, we don't get that caught up in that as to what happens with those type of forecast or in reality. Over a longer term, I guess, you'd see us adjust some things if it happened over a 6-month, 9-month period, but probably does not shift us much in the shorter term."

They're not leaving the country as much, and that can apply to also not spending out online, right? So they could've spent more online before U.S. dollars. So that stays there, but one of important things that has happened is we talk a lot about our talent and how we've had such a push throughout our company on building talent, a merchant talent, and our buying organization, even in the script today we talked about competitive advantage. We have a team up there who now is really executing, I think, at a high level. And a lot of that is because about 3 years ago, we started putting a full-court press on developing that team and stretching them and putting in the type of training programs and seniority and tenure that we really wanted that we, at the time, did not actually have up there as much as we had in some of our other businesses. So when you have a strong merchant team, which we do up there, merchandising and planning, and it's more seasoned now, you start to reap some of the benefits, and I think that's what we were also reaping last year as well as this year.

Gift-giving is like we often say, we are poised strategically, and this is something we've looked at in all of the 4 major divisions. We're poised to do a better job from -- I can't give you any specifics, but what I could say is from a -- how about this, for a merchandise mix perspective, on a marketing front as well as store execution. Because we have worked at all 3 of those factors and try to become more of a gift-giving destination. So years ago, you would -- as you would probably guess, T.J. Maxx maybe was not the coolest gift from. We are now today a very cool place to buy a holiday gift from. And our marketing programs have really helped with that, the merchandise mix. The other thing we've done is our -- because our supply chain is a better executed supply chain, we can turn goods around faster. So for a holiday, we have a lot of last-minute buys that now we can sprinkle in and get in pre-Christmas that we weren't able to do before. So that has been something we talked about with you, but I think sometimes we forget to mention it again. So in addition to the strategic gift-giving marketing and store setup that we do and merchandise mix that this year we have some more, I would say fashion-oriented categories that I think are going to be great impulse buys, I think, for the consumers. We're going to also have the quick turnaround from the market closer in unpredictable buys that I think will create just a more exciting fourth quarter business. And what I just said to you applies to all 4 divisions. And so I think I touched -- what I was saying, I think I touched a little on the in-store execution, but we look at that is clearly, and that's why it was in my script, we look at the -- first of all, our -- we talk a lot about the merchants. Our store operators are fantastic, and we have some extremely talented associates in our store operating divisions across all of our companies. And that has become a place, and I think it's helped with the cool factor and people shopping us is the way we execute our stores, and it's brought in younger customers and more excitement. And that yes, merchandise is certainly a high priority, but that has been right there with it in terms of, I think, driving top line and increasing market share."

Maxx or HomeGoods or Marshalls customer, both have been growing. And we are very, very happy with the growing of our credit card program, which we are adding more active -- significantly more active members. We can't give you the number, but significantly more every year. And obviously, we get additional spending from those consumers. When you go to Canada, they do not have a credit card loyalty program, but they do have a noncredit card loyalty program, which is also doing very, very well. And in the U.K., we are testing a loyalty program at this point -- as we speak. So that kind of very early in the process. And when you ask what is our -- our vision is to continue to do this in the model of our business, because we don't want to do anything that gets -- how would I put it? Gimmicky or promotional out of the loyalty program, which some retailers use it to, every now and then, do coupons, et cetera. So that is not a route we will take. But the way we do it, we feel like has brought tremendous communication between us and the consumer and loyalty and additional spending from those customers. Scott, do you want to add anything?"

Again, at the moment, it would not be at the impact of this year's impact of 3%. But it still would be low single digits, so we just wanted to call that out. So again, hopefully that will moderate and at some point will be a tailwind. Right now, it's a headwind. The third piece is the investment to support our growth. Again, primarily the distribution centers, and which has been a bit lumpy, as I think we've tried to explain before, because we do not plan the high level of comps we've experienced in some of our businesses forcing us to move forward, make sure we continue to gain all the market share we've gained. So it will -- those will still impact us going forward, but we think will moderate those systems and our distribution spend as we move forward in future years, but still going to impact us at least going forward for next year at a similar rate. And that's -- and so those are the 3 big components. So I don't think anything has changed. Hopefully, they'll start to moderate going forward."

Let me begin by saying that I am extremely pleased that our momentum continued in the third quarter. Consolidated comp store sales were up a strong 5% over a 5% increase last year and well-above our plan. We are thrilled that customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of our comp again this quarter, which tells us that our merchandise mix and amazing values are resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are gaining market share across all of our divisions. We also saw excellent performance in both our apparel and home businesses. Further, merchandise margins were up significantly again this quarter, highlighting the strength of our model.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, also well-above our expectations. Importantly, we believe that we achieved these results despite significant wage and foreign currency headwinds and while simultaneously investing to support our growth.
With our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS growth. We are in an excellent position for the holiday selling season, with many initiatives planned to drive traffic and sales throughout the quarter.
As always, our management team is passionate about achieving its plans and striving to surpass them. We are very confident in our ability to continue our successful growth and that is both in the U.S. and around the world.
Before I continue, I'll turn this call over to Scott to recap our third quarter numbers."
306688,408211418,1086601,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5%, exceeding our plan.

As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5%, exceeding our plan. As a reminder, this growth excludes our e-commerce businesses. It was great to see our momentum in customer traffic continue. Once again, traffic was the primary driver of our consolidated comp increase as we offered shoppers the merchandise they wanted at excellent values.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.83 versus last year's $0.86. As we detailed in today's press release, third quarter earnings per share included a debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge, which combined, reduced EPS by $0.08. Excluding these charges, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, a 6% increase over the same period last year and well-above our plan.
As expected, EPS growth was negatively impacted by 3% due to wage increases. Foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS growth by 1% versus our plan for a 3% negative impact.
Consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.7%. As we detailed in today's press release, the combination of the debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges reduced consolidated pretax profit margin by 100 basis points. Excluding these charges, adjusted pretax profit margin was 11.7%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year and also significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to our strong merchandise margin increase and gains on our inventory hedges.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.6%, up 90 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had anticipated.
At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were down 2% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with the great liquidity in our inventory position entering the fourth quarter. We are in an excellent position to buy and flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the holiday season.
Now to recap our third quarter performance by division. Marmaxx's strong momentum continued, with comps up 5% on top of last year's 3% increase. Again, this quarter, customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp and unit sales were up, both of which are a nice indication of the strength of our largest division.
Average ticket was down slightly more than planned, but merchandise margins were up significantly. We continued our strategies of chasing hot categories and flexing within departments to offer the right merchandise mix in our stores. Our traffic sales and merchandise margin increases tell us our strategies are working.
Segment profit margin decreased 40 basis points. Our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with the lower average ticket. Marmaxx keeps delivering sales increases year after year, which underscores our confidence in the major growth potential that still remains at our largest division.
HomeGoods delivered another excellent quarter, with comps increasing 6% over last year's 6% growth. We were very pleased that the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. As expected, wage increases continued to have a significant negative impact on the margin. Further, we continued to incur costs related to the opening of our new distribution center last quarter to support the long-term growth potential of 1,000 stores. Our customers love HomeGoods, and we couldn't be happier with this division's traffic and growth prospects.
At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 8% this quarter over last year's 10% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 100 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to merchandise margin pressure from transactional foreign exchange as well as additional supply chain costs, including the opening of our new distribution center in Vancouver last quarter, the first new DC for Canada in about a decade. We continue to be very pleased with the excellent execution of our Canadian organization.
TJX International's comps were flat versus last year's strong 7% increase. While sales were not as strong as we would have liked, we held up better than most major European retailers in the face of a challenging retail environment and unseasonably warm fall weather. We are convinced we are gaining market share in Europe and are focused on keeping new customers who we are attracting for the long term.
Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 170 basis points. The decline was primarily due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia -- in our businesses and some expense deleverage on the flat comp. That said, the team in Europe remained extremely disciplined in inventory management, which helped mitigate some of the margin pressure. As we enter the fourth quarter, we see opportunities to improve upon last year's performance.
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we paid out $170 million in shareholder dividends and bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first 9 months of the year, we have paid out $482 million in shareholder dividends and retired 15.4 million shares, buying back $1.2 billion of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,408211418,1086601,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 asso",1191,"Thanks, Scott.
I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.
First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 associates worldwide today, we have more than doubled the size of our buying team over the last 10 years. During this time, we have added hundreds of new people to our buying team, and we also have many buyers who have been with us for multiple decades. We believe we have one of the widest demographics in retail, and that the depth of our buying organization is helping us attract customers of all ages. This includes millennial shoppers as we are offering fashions in brands relevant to them. Further, our seasoned buyers play a big role in teaching and training our newer buyers and enhancing our off-price buying methodology. I truly believe that the collective knowledge and expertise of TJX's buying organization is the best in retail.
Second, we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Today, we source from a universe of over 18,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. This is thousands more vendors and dozens more countries than a decade ago. We believe we are an increasingly attractive outlet for vendors. We operate almost 3,800 stores in 9 countries, are opening new stores year after year and are selling a mix of branded merchandise. We are flexible and straightforward in our dealings and offer vendors many ways to grow their business.
Third, our global supply chain distribution network and IT systems have been developed and refined specifically to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. Our global distribution network can process thousands of buys from thousands of different vendors every week. Using our proprietary IT systems, our experienced planning and allocation team can precisely allocate that merchandise to the right store at the right time. Our flexibility allows us to react rapidly to changing market dynamics and consumer taste to capitalize on hot product categories and the latest fashion trends. We see our global infrastructure as a major advantage for TJX.
Next, we are capitalizing on our global presence. We have decades of operating experience in the U.S., Canada and Europe that we can leverage across the company. We have successfully opened new countries and retail brands by utilizing the expertise and operating knowledge across our organization. Our 4 major divisions are highly synergistic and share ideas, talent, initiatives and best practices. I believe the depth of our global off-price experience is unmatched and a key advantage as we continue our domestic and international growth.
All of these core strengths allow us to offer consumers an ever-changing, eclectic mix of branded merchandise at amazing values every day. In addition, these elements of our business have taken us multiple decades to develop, which is why they would be extremely difficult for any retailer to replicate.
Now let's talk about our growth initiatives, which we are confident will lead to further market share gains. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We have grown our top line year after year and are convinced that huge opportunities remain to continue growing our customer base. We are very pleased that our latest research, once again, shows that millennial shoppers make up the biggest percentage of our new customers in the U.S. Further, our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division. Innovation continues to be a major focus to keep our stores exciting and responsive to customer tastes, and we are constantly testing new ideas in each of our retail brands.
Our next major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. Long term, we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores, with just our current chains and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 1,800 additional stores on top of our current base before contemplating the potential of new change or new countries. Further, we see e-commerce as a complement to our physical locations and as a way to offer consumers the ability and convenience of shopping with us 24/7.
To support our growth, we are making significant investments in our business, which we have discussed on prior calls. I am very confident that we are making the right investments in our global infrastructure and new seeds to build on our leadership positions and capitalize on our first-mover advantages. We believe that all of this positions us very well for the future.
Now on to our opportunities for the fourth quarter, which are numerous. First, we have great gift-giving initiatives underway. We are offering exciting selections from around the globe and plan to ship to our stores multiple times each and every week. Shoppers can expect to see something new and surprising every time they visit, a strategy that has worked well for us in recent years and I believe, differentiates us from most major retailers. We are also confident that our efforts to upgrade our stores and customer service will make the shopping experience an exciting and positive one for our customers this holiday season when their time is so very valuable. 
Second, we feel great about our marketing campaigns, which all speak to who we are as a company. We are utilizing tri-branded campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. Our TV commercials have just launched and will be running every week throughout the holiday season. In addition, we are leveraging components of these campaigns across radio, digital and social media. In Europe, we'll be leveraging our [indiscernible] campaign across multiple geographies.
Third, our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada are an important vehicle for encouraging customers to shop as more frequently and across more of our retail brands.
Next, we believe we continue to get better at transitioning our stores every year and are very focused on our post-holiday plans. Most importantly, we will be offering consumers compelling values on fantastic merchandise. The marketplace is loaded with quality-branded merchandise across all of our geographies. We plan to take advantage of the numerous opportunities and buys [ph] throughout December.
In closing, I am very proud of our continued momentum of above-plan results and the sharp execution of our teams across the company. It was great to see another quarter of such strong sales and traffic increases. The entire organization is laser-focused on bringing more shoppers into our stores this holiday season and throughout the year. We have a clear, long-term vision for TJX, and I am convinced that we will continue to drive market share gains and achieve our plans for global growth. I am proud of our ability to simultaneously invest in our growth drivers as well as infrastructure and organization to support our growth while returning cash to shareholders through our substantial share buyback program and dividends.
I want to reiterate that our management team is passionate about achieving and surpassing our goals. We are very well on our way to becoming a $40 billion-plus company.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."

We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3",677,"Thanks, Ernie.
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the fourth quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 6% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling fourth quarter consolidated sales of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX.
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. This compares to a strong 6% comp increase for both TJX and Marmaxx in the fourth quarter last year.
Fourth quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 11.0% to 11.1% range versus 11.9% last year. We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 27.9% to 28.0% versus 28.7% last year. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales in the range of 16.8% to 16.9% versus 16.7% last year.
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $10 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 657 million.
Moving on to full year guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.41. As we noted in our press release today, we are raising our adjusted full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect above-plan third quarter results. Excluding the combined impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges, we are now -- expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.48. This would be up 4% to 5% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. Our plan assumes a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange.
As a reminder, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact of approximately 3% to fiscal '18 EPS growth.
On a consolidated basis, we're expecting a comp increase of 4% in fiscal '17. For the year, we expect pretax profit margin to be approximately 11.1%. Excluding the negative impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges of approximately 20 basis points, we expect adjusted pretax profit margins to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.4% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be approximately 28.9% versus 28.8% last year.
We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 17.4% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense of about $44 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 664 million.
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 4% on sales of $21.1 billion. Additionally, we expect segment profit margin to be about 14%. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming Marmaxx's average ticket to be down versus last year. At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 5% to 6% on sales of $4.4 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.5%. At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 8% to 9% on sales of $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%. At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of about 2% on sales of $4.4 billion and adjustment -- adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be about 5.8%.
It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

So as Scott said, we went after the hot-trending categories, but we also affected the ticket by consciously pushing off things like outerwear a little bit later and heavier knits, sweaters that tend to be higher ticket. So hopefully, that makes sense and helps answer that question. I think we'll continue to moderate as best we think. The only unknown is the market is loaded with goods. And that piece that Scott referred to as the second piece could still be applicable as the environment stays rather difficult. We want to continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So tough to say. We still have plenty of open-to-buy as we look out into the spring first quarter, but hopefully, that answers it."

Just curious, your margins there used to be 7%, 8%. I think you had somewhat more aspirational goals than that. So just curious, what kind of comp do you need in Europe to get the margins closer to high single digit? When does Trade Secret become more neutral to the earnings? And then the second question, hypothetically, at a 15% tax rate, you guys would be throwing off an additional $1 billion of free cash next year. So curious, I know you have a mix of international as well as domestic taxes. But is there really a thought internally that this is what could play out next year? And would you use that additional $1 billion for share repurchase, for dividends? Any thoughts along those lines would be helpful."

And then it would only comment, obviously, if it's relevant to our business. So just too early at this point to speculate. And in terms of Europe, I'll just start off for a second, and then Ernie -- the big -- some of the biggest impact has been FX over the -- in the last certainly last couple -- this year as it has been with Canada. We've had opening up the new businesses, not new businesses, new countries in the last year or 2. We've also been ramping up the number of stores, so with a 50-plus stores we've opened up, both this year and almost at that level last year, new stores, since it takes several years to get maturity put a bit of an impact on your earnings, that in combination with the systems and the infrastructure needed to support stores has certainly put it down. So it's really less about the comp the same level of comp when you hit that 3-plus range in all of our divisions and all things being equal, is usually the breakpoint. But with wage systems and opening up a number of stores in new countries, put a bit of a pressure. The only other thing before Ernie talks about Trade Secret and Europe in general, is as we move to the fourth quarter, we purchased Trade Secret at the end of October a year ago, so in terms of the deleverage, we would expect that to moderate and not be a meaningful impact as we enter actually the quarter that we're currently in the fourth."

So Brian, in terms of Europe, it's good timing for your question. I was there all last week, coincidentally. And we went did a lot of floor walks to the merchants as well as our field store personnel, and we are well poised for the fourth quarter. I have to tell you that I am extremely bullish on what I saw over there last week for where we are heading into mid-November in terms of a mix in the stores and how we're presenting and how we're staffed for servicing the customer. So feeling very good about that. The other thing to keep in mind there, and this, I think, starts to answer your question, at least in terms of yes, comp would help. Why do I think the comp will get better is they are positioned well, but the sales that we have, the flat [ph] quarter, we were dealing with unseasonably warm weather there. And you look at the environment as it is, and we are clearly gaining market share. If you look at some of the results of the come out, you don't like to give specifics on that, but you can see that we are making very major inroads, not dissimilar than we are here. It's just all of the numbers are lower there. There are bigger decreases. Some store closings were just announced from a couple of the retailers over there, which you can figure out who they were. And so we're very bullish on our market share gain there. Yes, the FX has really put a bit of a damper on the margin rate. Scott and I are often talking about how that has to come back to us at one point. And the medium and short-term here and I'm looking for us to continue to gain more customers and that team over there I wish sometimes you could see the team over there. They are extremely diligent at staying execution oriented when times get tough. So one of the things I give them credit for, I think you noticed the profit over there was slightly above our segment profit plan. And that was due to how diligently they control their liquidity and manage expenses on a quarter when the sales were only flat. So I give that team a lot of credit for staying liquid, watching expenses and getting poised for availability of which you can imagine they had enormous availability over there for the fourth quarter. So again, feeling very good about them."

It's down to more like about a few weeks, and it used to be double that not so long ago. So what that has allowed our merchants to do is continue to buy later into the season with more knowledge and take advantage of more inventory closeout lists that sometimes show up at a time before it would have become a packaway. And now it can become an in-season sales driver. That is great for the vendor because they don't have to deal with those on a packaway. And also at the same time, it's great for our customers, more importantly, because they get to see these fresh goods hitting in just before Christmas or just before Thanksgiving that are very fresh and were just recently in other stores.

Division in Canada that travels to Europe and internationally as well as satellite buying offices. We have buyers in Europe and a satellite office that represents HomeGoods and Marmaxx. We have California buying office. They travel to other countries. Our buying offices do a lot more exploratory trips. All the different buying officers will try go to new places where we think there are new categories of goods that will be exciting. Examples are like leather goods out of Italy, right? So -- or something that is out of Africa that would be great in the home deck area. Those are types of the things you're talking about that would hit Marmaxx that are more global-type buys. This clearly, if you look, we've even had light outdoor-type items that are bought from HomeGoods that are bought certainly, obviously internationally purchased by a buyer. So we've added to I think I talked about the buying staff has doubled over the last 10 years. And part of that buying structure is buying global merchandise going from other areas. So that has been a huge, huge, huge advantage. So that's why we have 1,000 buyers now. And when you see that -- I think I mentioned that we have 1,800 vendors, and that has grown up significant amount really just the last 5 years. A lot of those vendors are international vendors, and they are giving us that different flavor. So it's a great question because what we get out of it, we think, is a differentiating piece in our mix that other retailers really can't show. And it's because, as I said in my script, that's where I think we're a sourcing machine and really, we just have a very talented buying team that gets a lot of ground covered in a lot of parts of the world.

And we were not happy with our results prior to that as we were kind of weaning ourselves off that situation. But since that, we're feeling much better about the day-in, day-out traffic in purchasing. We still are now all in all happy with that IT -- with the website business. It's a little early to tell. So we have really gone after the store initiative, which I think we've talked about. We've got plenty of room now to find out about the web business because of this value pricing. We've done some reorg with merchants that are now in place, and we are feeling really good about going forward there. And we're actually, we have so much we can talk about some interesting marketing plans for the website going forward that I think are going pay big dividends along with the value pricing that we just started there. We put in some new merchants there to help with the website business, and the store ended the STP business we've actually been very happy with. That one has been a longer-term success rate for us. It's just early and it's really early in whole curve of building that business. So we're going to have some sites that at the year-end call we'll talk in more depth. We won't go into that today.

Let me begin by saying that I am extremely pleased that our momentum continued in the third quarter. Consolidated comp store sales were up a strong 5% over a 5% increase last year and well-above our plan. We are thrilled that customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of our comp again this quarter, which tells us that our merchandise mix and amazing values are resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are gaining market share across all of our divisions. We also saw excellent performance in both our apparel and home businesses. Further, merchandise margins were up significantly again this quarter, highlighting the strength of our model.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, also well-above our expectations. Importantly, we believe that we achieved these results despite significant wage and foreign currency headwinds and while simultaneously investing to support our growth.
With our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS growth. We are in an excellent position for the holiday selling season, with many initiatives planned to drive traffic and sales throughout the quarter.
As always, our management team is passionate about achieving its plans and striving to surpass them. We are very confident in our ability to continue our successful growth and that is both in the U.S. and around the world.
Before I continue, I'll turn this call over to Scott to recap our third quarter numbers."
306688,408211418,1086728,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5%, exceeding our plan.

As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5%, exceeding our plan. As a reminder, this growth excludes our e-commerce businesses. It was great to see our momentum in customer traffic continue. Once again, traffic was the primary driver of our consolidated comp increase as we offered shoppers the merchandise they wanted at excellent values.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.83 versus last year's $0.86. As we detailed in today's press release, third quarter earnings per share included a debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge, which combined, reduced EPS by $0.08. Excluding these charges, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, a 6% increase over the same period last year and well-above our plan.
As expected, EPS growth was negatively impacted by 3% due to wage increases. Foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS growth by 1% versus our plan for a 3% negative impact.
Consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.7%. As we detailed in today's press release, the combination of the debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges reduced consolidated pretax profit margin by 100 basis points. Excluding these charges, adjusted pretax profit margin was 11.7%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year and also significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to our strong merchandise margin increase and gains on our inventory hedges.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.6%, up 90 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had anticipated.
At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were down 2% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with the great liquidity in our inventory position entering the fourth quarter. We are in an excellent position to buy and flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the holiday season.
Now to recap our third quarter performance by division. Marmaxx's strong momentum continued, with comps up 5% on top of last year's 3% increase. Again, this quarter, customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp and unit sales were up, both of which are a nice indication of the strength of our largest division.
Average ticket was down slightly more than planned, but merchandise margins were up significantly. We continued our strategies of chasing hot categories and flexing within departments to offer the right merchandise mix in our stores. Our traffic sales and merchandise margin increases tell us our strategies are working.
Segment profit margin decreased 40 basis points. Our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with the lower average ticket. Marmaxx keeps delivering sales increases year after year, which underscores our confidence in the major growth potential that still remains at our largest division.
HomeGoods delivered another excellent quarter, with comps increasing 6% over last year's 6% growth. We were very pleased that the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. As expected, wage increases continued to have a significant negative impact on the margin. Further, we continued to incur costs related to the opening of our new distribution center last quarter to support the long-term growth potential of 1,000 stores. Our customers love HomeGoods, and we couldn't be happier with this division's traffic and growth prospects.
At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 8% this quarter over last year's 10% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 100 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to merchandise margin pressure from transactional foreign exchange as well as additional supply chain costs, including the opening of our new distribution center in Vancouver last quarter, the first new DC for Canada in about a decade. We continue to be very pleased with the excellent execution of our Canadian organization.
TJX International's comps were flat versus last year's strong 7% increase. While sales were not as strong as we would have liked, we held up better than most major European retailers in the face of a challenging retail environment and unseasonably warm fall weather. We are convinced we are gaining market share in Europe and are focused on keeping new customers who we are attracting for the long term.
Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 170 basis points. The decline was primarily due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia -- in our businesses and some expense deleverage on the flat comp. That said, the team in Europe remained extremely disciplined in inventory management, which helped mitigate some of the margin pressure. As we enter the fourth quarter, we see opportunities to improve upon last year's performance.
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we paid out $170 million in shareholder dividends and bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first 9 months of the year, we have paid out $482 million in shareholder dividends and retired 15.4 million shares, buying back $1.2 billion of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,408211418,1086728,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 asso",1190,"Thanks, Scott.
I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.
First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 associates worldwide today, we have more than doubled the size of our buying team over the last 10 years. During this time, we have added hundreds of new people to our buying team, and we also have many buyers who have been with us for multiple decades. We believe we have one of the widest demographics in retail, and that the depth of our buying organization is helping us attract customers of all ages. This includes millennial shoppers as we are offering fashions in brands relevant to them. Further, our seasoned buyers play a big role in teaching and training our newer buyers and enhancing our off-price buying methodology. I truly believe that the collective knowledge and expertise of TJX's buying organization is the best in retail.
Second, we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Today, we source from a universe of over 18,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. This is thousands more vendors and dozens more countries than a decade ago. We believe we are an increasingly attractive outlet for vendors. We operate almost 3,800 stores in 9 countries, are opening new stores year after year and are selling a mix of branded merchandise. We are flexible and straightforward in our dealings and offer vendors many ways to grow their business.
Third, our global supply chain distribution network and IT systems have been developed and refined specifically to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. Our global distribution network can process thousands of buys from thousands of different vendors every week. Using our proprietary IT systems, our experienced planning and allocation team can precisely allocate that merchandise to the right store at the right time. Our flexibility allows us to react rapidly to changing market dynamics and consumer taste to capitalize on hot product categories and the latest fashion trends. We see our global infrastructure as a major advantage for TJX.
Next, we are capitalizing on our global presence. We have decades of operating experience in the U.S., Canada and Europe that we can leverage across the company. We have successfully opened new countries and retail brands by utilizing the expertise and operating knowledge across our organization. Our 4 major divisions are highly synergistic and share ideas, talent, initiatives and best practices. I believe the depth of our global off-price experience is unmatched and a key advantage as we continue our domestic and international growth.
All of these core strengths allow us to offer consumers an ever-changing, eclectic mix of branded merchandise at amazing values every day. In addition, these elements of our business have taken us multiple decades to develop, which is why they would be extremely difficult for any retailer to replicate.
Now let's talk about our growth initiatives, which we are confident will lead to further market share gains. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We have grown our top line year after year and are convinced that huge opportunities remain to continue growing our customer base. We are very pleased that our latest research, once again, shows that millennial shoppers make up the biggest percentage of our new customers in the U.S. Further, our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division. Innovation continues to be a major focus to keep our stores exciting and responsive to customer tastes, and we are constantly testing new ideas in each of our retail brands.
Our next major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. Long term, we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores, with just our current chains and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 1,800 additional stores on top of our current base before contemplating the potential of new change or new countries. Further, we see e-commerce as a complement to our physical locations and as a way to offer consumers the ability and convenience of shopping with us 24/7.
To support our growth, we are making significant investments in our business, which we have discussed on prior calls. I am very confident that we are making the right investments in our global infrastructure and new seeds to build on our leadership positions and capitalize on our first-mover advantages. We believe that all of this positions us very well for the future.
Now on to our opportunities for the fourth quarter, which are numerous. First, we have great gift-giving initiatives underway. We are offering exciting selections from around the globe and plan to ship to our stores multiple times each and every week. Shoppers can expect to see something new and surprising every time they visit, a strategy that has worked well for us in recent years and I believe, differentiates us from most major retailers. We are also confident that our efforts to upgrade our stores and customer service will make the shopping experience an exciting and positive one for our customers this holiday season when their time is so very valuable. 
Second, we feel great about our marketing campaigns, which all speak to who we are as a company. We are utilizing tri-branded campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. Our TV commercials have just launched and will be running every week throughout the holiday season. In addition, we are leveraging components of these campaigns across radio, digital and social media. In Europe, we'll be leveraging our holiday campaign across multiple geographies.
Third, our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada are an important vehicle for encouraging customers to shop as more frequently and across more of our retail brands.
Next, we believe we continue to get better at transitioning our stores every year and are very focused on our post-holiday plans. Most importantly, we will be offering consumers compelling values on fantastic merchandise. The marketplace is loaded with quality-branded merchandise across all of our geographies. We plan to take advantage of the numerous opportunities and buys throughout December.
In closing, I am very proud of our continued momentum of above-plan results and the sharp execution of our teams across the company. It was great to see another quarter of such strong sales and traffic increases. The entire organization is laser-focused on bringing more shoppers into our stores this holiday season and throughout the year. We have a clear, long-term vision for TJX, and I am convinced that we will continue to drive market share gains and achieve our plans for global growth. I am proud of our ability to simultaneously invest in our growth drivers as well as infrastructure and organization to support our growth while returning cash to shareholders through our substantial share buyback program and dividends.
I want to reiterate that our management team is passionate about achieving and surpassing our goals. We are very well on our way to becoming a $40 billion-plus company.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."

We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3",677,"Thanks, Ernie.
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the fourth quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 6% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling fourth quarter consolidated sales of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX.
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. This compares to a strong 6% comp increase for both TJX and Marmaxx in the fourth quarter last year.
Fourth quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 11.0% to 11.1% range versus 11.9% last year. We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 27.9% to 28.0% versus 28.7% last year. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales in the range of 16.8% to 16.9% versus 16.7% last year.
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $10 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 657 million.
Moving on to full year guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.41. As we noted in our press release today, we are raising our adjusted full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect above-plan third quarter results. Excluding the combined impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges, we are now -- expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.48. This would be up 4% to 5% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. Our plan assumes a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange.
As a reminder, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact of approximately 3% to fiscal '18 EPS growth.
On a consolidated basis, we're expecting a comp increase of 4% in fiscal '17. For the year, we expect pretax profit margin to be approximately 11.1%. Excluding the negative impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges of approximately 20 basis points, we expect adjusted pretax profit margins to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.4% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be approximately 28.9% versus 28.8% last year.
We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 17.4% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense of about $44 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 664 million.
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 4% on sales of $21.1 billion. Additionally, we expect segment profit margin to be about 14%. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming Marmaxx's average ticket to be down versus last year. At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 5% to 6% on sales of $4.4 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.5%. At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 8% to 9% on sales of $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%. At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of about 2% on sales of $4.4 billion and adjustment -- adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be about 5.8%.
It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

So as Scott said, we went after the hot-trending categories, but we also affected the ticket by consciously pushing off things like outerwear a little bit later and heavier knits, sweaters that tend to be higher ticket. So hopefully, that makes sense and helps answer that question. I think we'll continue to moderate as best we think. The only unknown is the market is loaded with goods. And that piece that Scott referred to as the second piece could still be applicable as the environment stays rather difficult. We want to continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So tough to say. We still have plenty of open-to-buy as we look out into the spring first quarter, but hopefully, that answers it."

So I'd tell you, yes, it presents 2 opportunities. We do a little of both. We might be able to go up in retail if we see it happening. We just don't call that up at our level. We really let that -- just like when -- by the way, when the average tickets were going down, that was driven by a strategy from the buyer and merchandise manager level.

So we don't -- as others have, we aren't going in and investing off the high board, so to speak. So we are, I guess, you would call it leveling off on our investments there actually because we're a couple of years in on the tjmaxx.com business, so we're very getting very comfortable. We like the traffic we're getting. We like the sales the way it's going. And on the flip side, as you know, would be coming up and be careful on your cost structure. So in terms of the domestic e-com businesses, which are really tjmaxx.com and STP, we have taken a hard look at the cost structures and making sure that we keep our investment at a very appropriate level and in fact, a leveling off level, I guess, would be the best way to describe it. Also, in Europe, similar approach, and we're actually running the ad very efficiently and same idea with the investments. We're looking hard and fast. And all of that links into your second question: why do we do all that? Well, our e-com business in total is only a little over 1% of our total business. So when you asked the question -- first of all, would the e-com increases help our comp? Yes, but would it register? I would say not mathematically, not that strong because it's such a small percentage of the total today.

And then it would only comment, obviously, if it's relevant to our business. So just too early at this point to speculate. And in terms of Europe, I'll just start off for a second, and Ernie -- the big -- some of the biggest impact has been FX over the -- in the last -- certainly, the last couple -- this year as it has been with Canada. We've had opening up the new businesses -- not new businesses, new countries in the last year or 2. We've also been ramping up the number of stores, so with the 50-plus stores we've opened up, both this year and almost at that level last year, new stores, since it takes several years to get maturity, put a bit of an impact on earnings, that in combination with the systems and the infrastructure needed to support that stores has certainly put it down. So it's really less about the comp, the same level of comp when you hit that 3-plus range in all of our divisions and that all things being equal, is usually the breakpoint. But with wage systems and opening up a number of stores in new countries, put a bit of a pressure. The only other thing before Ernie talks about Trade Secret and Europe in general is as we move to the fourth quarter, we purchased Trade Secret at the end of October a year ago, so in terms of the deleverage, we would expect that to moderate and not be a meaningful impact as we enter actually the quarter that we're currently in the fourth."

So Brian, in terms of Europe, it's good timing for your question. I was there all last week, coincidentally.

So Brian, in terms of Europe, it's good timing for your question. I was there all last week, coincidentally. And we went -- did a lot of floor walks with the merchants as well as our field store personnel, and we are well-poised for the fourth quarter. I have to tell you that I am extremely bullish on what I saw over there last week for where we are heading into mid-November in terms of a mix in the stores and how we're presenting and how we're staffed for servicing the customer. So feeling very good about that. The other thing to keep in mind there, and this, I think, starts to answer your question, at least in terms of, yes, comp would help. Why do I think the comp will get better is they are positioned well, but the sales that we have, the flat quarter, we were dealing with unseasonably warm weather there. And you look at the environment as it is, and we are clearly gaining market share. If you look at some of the results that come out, we don't like to give specifics on that, but you can see that we are making very major inroads, not dissimilar than we are here. It's just all of the numbers are lower there. There are bigger decreases. Some store closings were just announced from a couple of the retailers over there, which you can figure out who they were. And so we're very bullish on our market share gain there. Yes, the FX has really put a bit of a damper on the margin rate. Scott and I are often talking about how that has to come back to us at one point. And the medium and short-term here, well, I'm looking for us to continue to gain more customers and that team over there -- I wish sometimes you could see the team over there. They are extremely diligent at staying execution-oriented when times get tough. So one of the things I give them credit for, I think you noticed the profit over there was slightly above our segment profit plan. And that was due to how diligently they control their liquidity and manage expenses on a quarter when the sales were only flat. So I give that team a lot of credit for staying liquid, watching expenses and getting poised for plenty of availability of which you can imagine they have enormous availability over there for the fourth quarter. So again, feeling very good about them."

But I'm wondering if you can just go through the list of 2016 investments and just talk about where you are in terms of the timing of how those investments are flowing into the expense structure, including an update on your systems upgrades that you're working on. And looking out to 2017, we understand you're not providing guidance today. Obviously, but is -- are there some expense pressures or investments that we should keep in mind looking out into calendar 2017?"

So the biggest thing we called out, we reiterated again in the script today was that there's the 3% wage increase. So that we still have in the 3% impact to next year in terms of EPS growth. In terms of other items, too early to make a call on FX other than at this point, it would be -- I mean, it's clearly, as we called out, a 3% overall impact this year, too early to make a call than -- with the continued drop of the pound over the last 2 quarters. It will be some impact, but that's about all we're going to say at this point in time. There's too much buying that hasn't taken place and all that to really get specific in terms of what the impact on currency will be on our mark-on. And as we all know, there's been a lot of movements in the last 2 years at the end of the year on currency, so too early to call on the market other than what we have in our guidance for the fourth quarter. In terms of the investments for -- about systems and supply chain, you're correct. We have the 2 DCs of Canada and HomeGoods that happened this year. But we really haven't been specific other than what we said in the last 2 quarters that we expect that our supply -- overall supply chain and IT costs to be about the same impact next year. But it's again, that's not our -- that's what we've been saying. We'll give further clarification on that as -- in the year -- on our year-end call. So unfortunately, no new news in terms of the specific timing of how it's going to impact the quarters in next year."

We probably saved, and we can't really give you an exact amount of time, but it's really down to -- how about this: it's down to more like a few weeks, and it used to be double that not so long ago. So what that has allowed our merchants to do is continue to buy later into the season with more knowledge and take advantage of more inventory closeout lists that sometimes show up at a time when before it would have become a packaway. And now it can become an in-season sales driver. That is great for the vendor because they don't have to deal with us on a packaway. And also at the same time, it's great for our customers, more importantly, because they get to see these fresh goods hitting in just before Christmas or just before Thanksgiving that are very fresh and were just recently in other stores. So great question. And again, it's been one of the big needle movers, I think, in our buying approach over the last 5 or 7 years."

One is our divisions are more linked up, so we have a division in Europe, which has many buyers in Europe. Division in Canada that travels to Europe and internationally as well as satellite buying offices. We have buyers in Europe and a satellite office that represents HomeGoods and Marmaxx. We have a California buying office. They travel to other countries. Our buying offices do a lot more exploratory trips. All the different buying officers will try to go into new places where we think there are new categories of goods that would be exciting. Examples are like leather goods out of Italy, right? So -- or something that is out of Africa that would be great in the home deck area. Those are the types of things you're talking about that would hit Marmaxx that are more global-type buys. This clearly, if you look, we even had like outdoor-type items that are bought for HomeGoods that are bought certainly, obviously internationally purchased by our buyer. So we've added to -- I think, I talked about the buying staff has doubled over the last 10 years. And part of that buying structure is buying global merchandise, scoring from other areas. So that has been a huge, huge, huge advantage. That's why we have 1,000 buyers now. And when you see that -- I think, I mentioned that we have 1,800 vendors, and that has grown up a significant amount really just the last 5 years. A lot of those vendors are international vendors, and they are giving us that different flavor. So it's a great question because what we get out of it, we think, is a differentiating piece in our mix that other retailers really can't show. And it's because, as I said in my script, that's where I think we're a sourcing machine and really, we just have a very talented buying team that gets a lot of ground covered in a lot of parts of the world. Hopefully, that answers your question."

So interesting timing for you to ask this question because we have recently taken a big chunk of that and gone to everyday value that -- when I say recently, that was about a month ago. And we were not happy with our results prior to that as we were kind of weaning ourselves off that situation. But since that, we're feeling much better about the day-in, day-out traffic in purchasing. We still are not, all in all, happy with that IT -- with the website business. It's a little early to tell. So we have really gone after the store initiative, which I think we've talked about. We want -- we've got plenty of room now to find out about the web business because of this value pricing. We've done some reorg with merchants that are now in place, and we are feeling really good about going forward there. And we're actually, we have so much we can't talk about some interesting marketing plans for the website going forward that I think are going pay big dividends along with the value pricing that we just started there. We put in some new merchants there to help with the website business, and the store ended the STP business we've actually been very happy with. That one's been a longer-term success rate for us. It's just early, and it's really early in the whole curve of building that business. So we're going to have some sites that at the year-end call we'll talk in more depth. We won't go into that today. We'll talk about at the year-end call some of the stores that we're going to open there, and we'll give more color, I think, on the total business at that point in time.
So I believe that is the end of our call. Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you at our year-end earnings call in February. Thank you, everybody."

Let me begin by saying that I am extremely pleased that our momentum continued in the third quarter. Consolidated comp store sales were up a strong 5% over a 5% increase last year and well-above our plan. We are thrilled that customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of our comp again this quarter, which tells us that our merchandise mix and amazing values are resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are gaining market share across all of our divisions. We also saw excellent performance in both our apparel and home businesses. Further, merchandise margins were up significantly again this quarter, highlighting the strength of our model.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, also well-above our expectations. Importantly, we believe that we achieved these results despite significant wage and foreign currency headwinds and while simultaneously investing to support our growth.
With our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS growth. We are in an excellent position for the holiday selling season, with many initiatives planned to drive traffic and sales throughout the quarter.
As always, our management team is passionate about achieving its plans and striving to surpass them. We are very confident in our ability to continue our successful growth and that is both in the U.S. and around the world.
Before I continue, I'll turn this call over to Scott to recap our third quarter numbers."

As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5%, exceeding our plan. As a reminder, this growth excludes our e-commerce businesses. It was great to see our momentum in customer traffic continue. Once again, traffic was the primary driver of our consolidated comp increase as we offered shoppers the merchandise they wanted at excellent values.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.83 versus last year's $0.86. As we detailed in today's press release, third quarter earnings per share included a debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge, which combined, reduced EPS by $0.08. Excluding these charges, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, a 6% increase over the same period last year and well-above our plan.
As expected, EPS growth was negatively impacted by 3% due to wage increases. Foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS growth by 1% versus our plan for a 3% negative impact.
Consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.7%. As we detailed in today's press release, the combination of the debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges reduced consolidated pretax profit margin by 100 basis points. Excluding these charges, adjusted pretax profit margin was 11.7%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year and also significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to our strong merchandise margin increase and gains on our inventory hedges.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.6%, up 90 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had anticipated.
At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were down 2% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with the great liquidity in our inventory position entering the fourth quarter. We are in an excellent position to buy and flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the holiday season.
Now to recap our third quarter performance by division. Marmaxx's strong momentum continued, with comps up 5% on top of last year's 3% increase. Again, this quarter, customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp and unit sales were up, both of which are a nice indication of the strength of our largest division.
Average ticket was down slightly more than planned, but merchandise margins were up significantly. We continued our strategies of chasing hot categories and flexing within departments to offer the right merchandise mix in our stores. Our traffic sales and merchandise margin increases tell us our strategies are working.
Segment profit margin decreased 40 basis points. Our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with the lower average ticket. Marmaxx keeps delivering sales increases year after year, which underscores our confidence in the major growth potential that still remains at our largest division.
HomeGoods delivered another excellent quarter, with comps increasing 6% over last year's 6% growth. We were very pleased that the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. As expected, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact on the margin. Further, we continued to incur costs related to the opening of our new distribution center last quarter to support the long-term growth potential of 1,000 stores. Our customers love HomeGoods, and we couldn't be happier with this division's traffic and growth prospects.
At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 8% this quarter over last year's 10% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 100 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to merchandise margin pressure from transactional foreign exchange as well as additional supply chain costs, including the opening of our new distribution center in Vancouver last quarter, the first new DC for Canada in about a decade. We continue to be very pleased with the excellent execution of our Canadian organization.
TJX International's comps were flat versus last year's strong 7% increase. While sales were not as strong as we would have liked, we held up better than most major European retailers in the face of a challenging retail environment and unseasonably warm fall weather. We are convinced we are gaining market share in Europe and are focused on keeping new customers who we are attracting for the long term.
Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 170 basis points. The decline was primarily due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia -- in our businesses and some expense deleverage on the flat comp. That said, the team in Europe remained extremely disciplined in inventory management, which helped mitigate some of the margin pressure. As we enter the fourth quarter, we see opportunities to improve upon last year's performance.
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we paid out $170 million in shareholder dividends and bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first 9 months of the year, we have paid out $482 million in shareholder dividends and retired 15.4 million shares, buying back $1.2 billion of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,408211418,1086868,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 asso",1190,"Thanks, Scott.
I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.
First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 associates worldwide today, we have more than doubled the size of our buying team over the last 10 years. During this time, we have added hundreds of new people to our buying team, and we also have many buyers who have been with us for multiple decades. We believe we have one of the widest demographics in retail, and that the depth of our buying organization is helping us attract customers of all ages. This includes millennial shoppers as we are offering fashions in brands relevant to them. Further, our seasoned buyers play a big role in teaching and training our newer buyers and enhancing our off-price buying methodology. I truly believe that the collective knowledge and expertise of TJX's buying organization is the best in retail.
Second, we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Today, we source from a universe of over 18,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. This is thousands more vendors and dozens more countries than a decade ago. We believe we are an increasingly attractive outlet for vendors. We operate almost 3,800 stores in 9 countries, are opening new stores year after year and are selling a mix of branded merchandise. We are flexible and straightforward in our dealings and offer vendors many ways to grow their business.
Third, our global supply chain distribution network and IT systems have been developed and refined specifically to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. Our global distribution network can process thousands of buys from thousands of different vendors every week. Using our proprietary IT systems, our experienced planning and allocation team can precisely allocate that merchandise to the right store at the right time. Our flexibility allows us to react rapidly to changing market dynamics and consumer taste to capitalize on hot product categories and the latest fashion trends. We see our global infrastructure as a major advantage for TJX.
Next, we are capitalizing on our global presence. We have decades of operating experience in the U.S., Canada and Europe that we can leverage across the company. We have successfully opened new countries and retail brands by utilizing the expertise and operating knowledge across our organization. Our 4 major divisions are highly synergistic and share ideas, talent, initiatives and best practices. I believe the depth of our global off-price experience is unmatched and a key advantage as we continue our domestic and international growth.
All of these core strengths allow us to offer consumers an ever-changing, eclectic mix of branded merchandise at amazing values every day. In addition, these elements of our business have taken us multiple decades to develop, which is why they would be extremely difficult for any retailer to replicate.
Now let's talk about our growth initiatives, which we are confident will lead to further market share gains. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We have grown our top line year after year and are convinced that huge opportunities remain to continue growing our customer base. We are very pleased that our latest research, once again, shows that millennial shoppers make up the biggest percentage of our new customers in the U.S. Further, our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division. Innovation continues to be a major focus to keep our stores exciting and responsive to customer tastes, and we are constantly testing new ideas in each of our retail brands.
Our next major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. Long term, we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores, with just our current chains and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 1,800 additional stores on top of our current base before contemplating the potential of new change or new countries. Further, we see e-commerce as a complement to our physical locations and as a way to offer consumers the ability and convenience of shopping with us 24/7.
To support our growth, we are making significant investments in our business, which we have discussed on prior calls. I am very confident that we are making the right investments in our global infrastructure and new seeds to build on our leadership positions and capitalize on our first-mover advantages. We believe that all of this positions us very well for the future.
Now on to our opportunities for the fourth quarter, which are numerous. First, we have great gift-giving initiatives underway. We are offering exciting selections from around the globe and plan to ship to our stores multiple times each and every week. Shoppers can expect to see something new and surprising every time they visit, a strategy that has worked well for us in recent years and I believe, differentiates us from most major retailers. We are also confident that our efforts to upgrade our stores and customer service will make the shopping experience an exciting and positive one for our customers this holiday season when their time is so very valuable. 
Second, we feel great about our marketing campaigns, which all speak to who we are as a company. We are utilizing tri-branded campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. Our TV commercials have just launched and will be running every week throughout the holiday season. In addition, we are leveraging components of these campaigns across radio, digital and social media. In Europe, we'll be leveraging our holiday campaign across multiple geographies.
Third, our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada are an important vehicle for encouraging customers to shop as more frequently and across more of our retail brands.
Next, we believe we continue to get better at transitioning our stores every year and are very focused on our post-holiday plans. Most importantly, we will be offering consumers compelling values on fantastic merchandise. The marketplace is loaded with quality-branded merchandise across all of our geographies. We plan to take advantage of the numerous opportunities and buys throughout December.
In closing, I am very proud of our continued momentum of above-plan results and the sharp execution of our teams across the company. It was great to see another quarter of such strong sales and traffic increases. The entire organization is laser-focused on bringing more shoppers into our stores this holiday season and throughout the year. We have a clear, long-term vision for TJX, and I am convinced that we will continue to drive market share gains and achieve our plans for global growth. I am proud of our ability to simultaneously invest in our growth drivers as well as infrastructure and organization to support our growth while returning cash to shareholders through our substantial share buyback program and dividends.
I want to reiterate that our management team is passionate about achieving and surpassing our goals. We are very well on our way to becoming a $40 billion-plus company.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."
306688,408211418,1086868,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie.Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the fourth quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3",677,"Thanks, Ernie.
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the fourth quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 6% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling fourth quarter consolidated sales of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX.
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. This compares to a strong 6% comp increase for both TJX and Marmaxx in the fourth quarter last year.
Fourth quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 11.0% to 11.1% range versus 11.9% last year. We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 27.9% to 28.0% versus 28.7% last year. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales in the range of 16.8% to 16.9% versus 16.7% last year.
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $10 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 657 million.
Moving on to full year guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.41. As we noted in our press release today, we are raising our adjusted full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect above-plan third quarter results. Excluding the combined impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges, we are now -- expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.48. This would be up 4% to 5% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. Our plan assumes a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange.
As a reminder, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact of approximately 3% to fiscal '18 EPS growth.
On a consolidated basis, we're expecting a comp increase of 4% in fiscal '17. For the year, we expect pretax profit margin to be approximately 11.1%. Excluding the negative impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges of approximately 20 basis points, we expect adjusted pretax profit margins to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.4% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be approximately 28.9% versus 28.8% last year.
We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 17.4% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense of about $44 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 664 million.
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 4% on sales of $21.1 billion. Additionally, we expect segment profit margin to be about 14%. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming Marmaxx's average ticket to be down versus last year. At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 5% to 6% on sales of $4.4 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.5%. At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 8% to 9% on sales of $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%. At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of about 2% on sales of $4.4 billion and adjustment -- adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be about 5.8%.
It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

So as Scott said, we went after the hot-trending categories, but we also affected the ticket by consciously pushing off things like outerwear a little bit later and heavier knits, sweaters that tend to be higher ticket. So hopefully, that makes sense and helps answer that question. I think we'll continue to moderate as best we think. The only unknown is the market is loaded with goods. And that piece that Scott referred to as the second piece could still be applicable as the environment stays rather difficult. We want to continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So tough to say. We still have plenty of open-to-buy as we look out into the spring first quarter, but hopefully, that answers it."

So they are not necessarily going to raise the retail. We haven't seen it yet anyway, and we let that process happen more bottom-up from our buyers and merchandise managers that are always looking at what the other retailers are retailing at. So I'd tell you, yes, it presents 2 opportunities. We do a little of both. We might be able to go up in retail if we see it happening. We just don't call that up at our level. We really let that -- just like when -- by the way, when the average tickets were going down, that was driven by a strategy from the buyer and merchandise manager level. This happens surgically -- very surgically by item, by vendor, down to the department level, when we surgically take them up at times. So hopefully, that answers your question.

So there is a, how would I put it? There's always a lot of goods. But as you saw or heard in the script, and we talked about it last time as well, the market is ramped up a little bit in terms of more loading marketplace across more categories than we've seen in the past. So as much as you'll read that retails have tightened up on inventory, we are not running into that situation in terms of market availability, in terms of what's in the wholesale market. So that presents an opportunity for us to -- where possible, run with leaner inventories to take advantage closer in on the buying. So hopefully, you understand we're going to try to buy -- I guess, simplifying it, more hand-to-mouth closer in than we were a year ago because of the availability. So..."

So we don't -- as others have, we aren't going in and investing off the high board, so to speak. So we are, I guess, you would call it leveling off on our investments there actually because we're a couple of years in on the tjmaxx.com business, so we're very getting very comfortable. We like the traffic we're getting. We like the sales the way it's going. And on the flip side, as you know, would be coming up and be careful on your cost structure. So in terms of the domestic e-com businesses, which are really tjmaxx.com and STP, we have taken a hard look at the cost structures and making sure that we keep our investment at a very appropriate level and in fact, a leveling off level, I guess, would be the best way to describe it. Also, in Europe, similar approach, and we're actually running the ad very efficiently and same idea with the investments. We're looking hard and fast. And all of that links into your second question: why do we do all that? Well, our e-com business in total is only a little over 1% of our total business. So when you asked the question -- first of all, would the e-com increases help our comp? Yes, but would it register? I would say not mathematically, not that strong because it's such a small percentage of the total today. Having said that, it's growing at a faster clip than the brick-and-mortar, just a very small base, a little over 1%."

And then it would only comment, obviously, if it's relevant to our business. So just too early at this point to speculate. And in terms of Europe, I'll just start off for a second, and Ernie -- the big -- some of the biggest impact has been FX over the -- in the last -- certainly, the last couple -- this year as it has been with Canada. We've had opening up the new businesses -- not new businesses, new countries in the last year or 2. We've also been ramping up the number of stores, so with the 50-plus stores we've opened up, both this year and almost at that level last year, new stores, since it takes several years to get maturity, put a bit of an impact on earnings, that in combination with the systems and the infrastructure needed to support that stores has certainly put it down. So it's really less about the comp, the same level of comp when you hit that 3-plus range in all of our divisions and that all things being equal, is usually the breakpoint. But with wage systems and opening up a number of stores in new countries, put a bit of a pressure. The only other thing before Ernie talks about Trade Secret and Europe in general is as we move to the fourth quarter, we purchased Trade Secret at the end of October a year ago, so in terms of the deleverage, we would expect that to moderate and not be a meaningful impact as we enter actually the quarter that we're currently in the fourth."

So Brian, in terms of Europe, it's good timing for your question. I was there all last week, coincidentally.

So Brian, in terms of Europe, it's good timing for your question. I was there all last week, coincidentally. And we went -- did a lot of floor walks with the merchants as well as our field store personnel, and we are well-poised for the fourth quarter. I have to tell you that I am extremely bullish on what I saw over there last week for where we are heading into mid-November in terms of a mix in the stores and how we're presenting and how we're staffed for servicing the customer. So feeling very good about that. The other thing to keep in mind there, and this, I think, starts to answer your question, at least in terms of, yes, comp would help. Why do I think the comp will get better is they are positioned well, but the sales that we have, the flat quarter, we were dealing with unseasonably warm weather there. And you look at the environment as it is, and we are clearly gaining market share. If you look at some of the results that come out, we don't like to give specifics on that, but you can see that we are making very major inroads, not dissimilar than we are here. It's just all of the numbers are lower there. There are bigger decreases. Some store closings were just announced from a couple of the retailers over there, which you can figure out who they were. And so we're very bullish on our market share gain there. Yes, the FX has really put a bit of a damper on the margin rate. Scott and I are often talking about how that has to come back to us at one point. And the medium and short-term here, though I'm looking for us to continue to gain more customers and that team over there -- I wish sometimes you could see the team over there. They are extremely diligent at staying execution-oriented when times get tough. So one of the things I give them credit for, I think you noticed the profit over there was slightly above our segment profit plan. And that was due to how diligently they control their liquidity and manage expenses on a quarter when the sales were only flat. So I give that team a lot of credit for staying liquid, watching expenses and getting poised for plenty of availability of which you can imagine they have enormous availability over there for the fourth quarter. So again, feeling very good about them."

We probably saved, and we can't really give you an exact amount of time, but it's really down to -- how about this: it's down to more like a few weeks, and it used to be double that not so long ago. So what that has allowed our merchants to do is continue to buy later into the season with more knowledge and take advantage of more inventory closeout lists that sometimes show up at a time when before it would have become a packaway. And now it can become an in-season sales driver. That is great for the vendor because they don't have to deal with us on a packaway. And also at the same time, it's great for our customers, more importantly, because they get to see these fresh goods hitting in just before Christmas or just before Thanksgiving that are very fresh and were just recently in other stores. So great question. And again, it's been one of the big needle movers, I think, in our buying approach over the last 5 or 7 years."

One is our divisions are more linked up, so we have a division in Europe, which has many buyers in Europe. Division in Canada that travels to Europe and internationally as well as satellite buying offices. We have buyers in Europe and a satellite office that represents HomeGoods and Marmaxx. We have a Californian buying office. They travel to other countries. Our buying offices do a lot more exploratory trips. All the different buying officers will try to go into new places where we think there are new categories of goods that would be exciting. Examples are like leather goods out of Italy, right? So -- or something that is out of Africa that would be great in the home deck area. Those are the types of things you're talking about that would hit Marmaxx that are more global-type buys. This clearly, if you look, we even had like outdoor-type items that are bought for HomeGoods that are bought certainly, obviously internationally purchased by our buyer. So we've added to -- I think, I talked about the buying staff has doubled over the last 10 years. And part of that buying structure is buying global merchandise, scoring from other areas. So that has been a huge, huge, huge advantage. That's why we have 1,000 buyers now. And when you see that -- I think, I mentioned that we have 1,800 vendors, and that has grown up a significant amount in really just the last 5 years. A lot of those vendors are international vendors, and are giving us that different flavor. So it's a great question because what we get out of it, we think, is a differentiating piece in our mix that other retailers really can't show. And it's because, as I said in my script, that's where I think we're a sourcing machine and really, we just have a very talented buying team that gets a lot of ground covered in a lot of parts of the world. Hopefully, that answers your question."

So Sierra Trading Post, when we acquired it, we've -- and I think we've talked about this before. We've been going through some learnings in terms of remodeling the business because the business was -- the website was much more promotional than as you can imagine, we would want it to be being an every-day-value off-price retailer. So interesting timing for you to ask this question because we have recently taken a big chunk of that and gone to everyday value that -- when I say recently, that was about a month ago. And we were not happy with our results prior to that as we were kind of weaning ourselves off that situation. But since that, we're feeling much better about the day-in, day-out traffic in purchasing. We still are not, all in all, happy with that IT -- with the website business. It's a little early to tell. So we have really gone after the store initiative, which I think we've talked about. We want -- we've got plenty of room now to find out about the web business because of this value pricing. We've done some reorg with merchants that are now in place, and we are feeling really good about going forward there. And we're actually, we have so much we can't talk about some interesting marketing plans for the website going forward that I think are going pay big dividends along with the value pricing that we just started there. We put in some new merchants there to help with the website business, and the store end of the STP business we've actually been very happy with. That one's been a longer-term success rate for us. It's just early, and it's really early in the whole curve of building that business. So we're going to have some sites that at the year-end call we'll talk in more depth. We won't go into that today. We'll talk about at the year-end call some of the stores that we're going to open there, and we'll give more color, I think, on the total business at that point in time.
So I believe that is the end of our call. Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you at our year-end earnings call in February. Thank you, everybody."

Let me begin by saying that I am extremely pleased that our momentum continued in the third quarter. Consolidated comp store sales were up a strong 5% over a 5% increase last year and well-above our plan. We are thrilled that customer traffic continued to be the primary driver of our comp again this quarter, which tells us that our merchandise mix and amazing values are resonating with consumers. We are convinced that we are gaining market share across all of our divisions. We also saw excellent performance in both our apparel and home businesses. Further, merchandise margins were up significantly again this quarter, highlighting the strength of our model.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, also well-above our expectations. Importantly, we believe that we achieved these results despite significant wage and foreign currency headwinds and while simultaneously investing to support our growth.
With our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS growth. We are in an excellent position for the holiday selling season, with many initiatives planned to drive traffic and sales throughout the quarter.
As always, our management team is passionate about achieving its plans and striving to surpass them. We are very confident in our ability to continue our successful growth and that is both in the U.S. and around the world.
Before I continue, I'll turn this call over to Scott to recap our third quarter numbers."
306688,408211418,1087242,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone.As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5%, exceeding our plan.

As Ernie mentioned, our third quarter consolidated comparable store sales increased a strong 5%, exceeding our plan. As a reminder, this growth excludes our e-commerce businesses. It was great to see our momentum in customer traffic continue. Once again, traffic was the primary driver of our consolidated comp increase as we offered shoppers the merchandise they wanted at excellent values.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.83 versus last year's $0.86. As we detailed in today's press release, third quarter earnings per share included a debt extinguishment charge and pension settlement charge, which combined, reduced EPS by $0.08. Excluding these charges, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, a 6% increase over the same period last year and well-above our plan.
As expected, EPS growth was negatively impacted by 3% due to wage increases. Foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS growth by 1% versus our plan for a 3% negative impact.
Consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.7%. As we detailed in today's press release, the combination of the debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges reduced consolidated pretax profit margin by 100 basis points. Excluding these charges, adjusted pretax profit margin was 11.7%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year and significantly better than we planned. Gross profit margin was 29.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year and also significantly better than we planned. This was primarily due to our strong merchandise margin increase and gains on our inventory hedges.
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 17.6%, up 90 basis points versus last year's ratio. This increase was primarily due to wage increases and investments to support our growth as we had anticipated.
At the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were down 2% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with the great liquidity in our inventory position entering the fourth quarter. We are in an excellent position to buy and flow fresh goods to our stores throughout the holiday season.
Now to recap our third quarter performance by division. Marmaxx's strong momentum continued, with comps up 5% on top of last year's 3% increase. Again, this quarter, customer traffic was the primary driver of the comp and unit sales were up, both of which are a nice indication of the strength of our largest division.
Average ticket was down slightly more than planned, but merchandise margins were up significantly. We continued our strategies of chasing hot categories and flexing within departments to offer the right merchandise mix in our stores. Our traffic sales and merchandise margin increases tell us our strategies are working.
Segment profit margin decreased 40 basis points. Our very strong merchandise margin increase was more than offset by wage increases and costs associated with the lower average ticket. Marmaxx keeps delivering sales increases year after year, which underscores our confidence in the major growth potential that still remains at our largest division.
HomeGoods delivered another excellent quarter, with comps increasing 6% over last year's 6% growth. We were very pleased that the traffic was the primary driver of the comp increase. Segment profit margin was down 10 basis points. As expected, wage increases continue to have a significant negative impact on the margin. Further, we continued to incur costs related to the opening of our new distribution center last quarter to support the long-term growth potential of 1,000 stores. Our customers love HomeGoods, and we couldn't be happier with this division's traffic and growth prospects.
At TJX Canada, comps grew an outstanding 8% this quarter over last year's 10% increase. Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 100 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to merchandise margin pressure from transactional foreign exchange as well as additional supply chain costs, including the opening of our new distribution center in Vancouver last quarter, the first new DC for Canada in about a decade. We continue to be very pleased with the excellent execution of our Canadian organization.
TJX International's comps were flat versus last year's strong 7% increase. While sales were not as strong as we would have liked, we held up better than most major European retailers in the face of a challenging retail environment and unseasonably warm fall weather. We are convinced we are gaining market share in Europe and are focused on keeping new customers who we are attracting for the long term.
Adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, was down 170 basis points. The decline was primarily due to integrating Trade Secret in Australia -- in our businesses and some expense deleverage on the flat comp. That said, the team in Europe remained extremely disciplined in inventory management, which helped mitigate some of the margin pressure. As we enter the fourth quarter, we see opportunities to improve upon last year's performance.
I'll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we paid out $170 million in shareholder dividends and bought back $400 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.2 million shares. For the first 9 months of the year, we have paid out $482 million in shareholder dividends and retired 15.4 million shares, buying back $1.2 billion of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.5 billion to $2 billion of TJX stock this year.
Now let me turn the call back to Ernie, and I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '17 guidance at the end of the call."
306688,408211418,1087242,"The TJX Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2016",2016-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The TJX Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott.I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 asso",1190,"Thanks, Scott.
I'd like to begin by highlighting our fundamental strengths, which we believe differentiate TJX from the marketplace and are key to us continuing to gain market share.
First, we have a world-class buying organization. With over 1,000 associates worldwide today, we have more than doubled the size of our buying team over the last 10 years. During this time, we have added hundreds of new people to our buying team, and we also have many buyers who have been with us for multiple decades. We believe we have one of the widest demographics in retail, and that the depth of our buying organization is helping us attract customers of all ages. This includes millennial shoppers as we are offering fashions in brands relevant to them. Further, our seasoned buyers play a big role in teaching and training our newer buyers and enhancing our off-price buying methodology. I truly believe that the collective knowledge and expertise of TJX's buying organization is the best in retail.
Second, we see ourselves as a global sourcing machine. Today, we source from a universe of over 18,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. This is thousands more vendors and dozens more countries than a decade ago. We believe we are an increasingly attractive outlet for vendors. We operate almost 3,800 stores in 9 countries, are opening new stores year after year and are selling a mix of branded merchandise. We are flexible and straightforward in our dealings and offer vendors many ways to grow their business.
Third, our global supply chain distribution network and IT systems have been developed and refined specifically to support our highly integrated international business and opportunistic buying. Our global distribution network can process thousands of buys from thousands of different vendors every week. Using our proprietary IT systems, our experienced planning and allocation team can precisely allocate that merchandise to the right store at the right time. Our flexibility allows us to react rapidly to changing market dynamics and consumer taste to capitalize on hot product categories and the latest fashion trends. We see our global infrastructure as a major advantage for TJX.
Next, we are capitalizing on our global presence. We have decades of operating experience in the U.S., Canada and Europe that we can leverage across the company. We have successfully opened new countries and retail brands by utilizing the expertise and operating knowledge across our organization. Our 4 major divisions are highly synergistic and share ideas, talent, initiatives and best practices. I believe the depth of our global off-price experience is unmatched and a key advantage as we continue our domestic and international growth.
All of these core strengths allow us to offer consumers an ever-changing, eclectic mix of branded merchandise at amazing values every day. In addition, these elements of our business have taken us multiple decades to develop, which is why they would be extremely difficult for any retailer to replicate.
Now let's talk about our growth initiatives, which we are confident will lead to further market share gains. Our number one initiative remains driving customer traffic and comp sales. We have grown our top line year after year and are convinced that huge opportunities remain to continue growing our customer base. We are very pleased that our latest research, once again, shows that millennial shoppers make up the biggest percentage of our new customers in the U.S. Further, our customer satisfaction scores increased at every division. Innovation continues to be a major focus to keep our stores exciting and responsive to customer tastes, and we are constantly testing new ideas in each of our retail brands.
Our next major growth driver is our enormous global store growth potential. Long term, we see the potential to grow to 5,600 stores, with just our current chains and just our current markets alone. This represents more than 1,800 additional stores on top of our current base before contemplating the potential of new change or new countries. Further, we see e-commerce as a complement to our physical locations and as a way to offer consumers the ability and convenience of shopping with us 24/7.
To support our growth, we are making significant investments in our business, which we have discussed on prior calls. I am very confident that we are making the right investments in our global infrastructure and new seeds to build on our leadership positions and capitalize on our first-mover advantages. We believe that all of this positions us very well for the future.
Now on to our opportunities for the fourth quarter, which are numerous. First, we have great gift-giving initiatives underway. We are offering exciting selections from around the globe and plan to ship to our stores multiple times each and every week. Shoppers can expect to see something new and surprising every time they visit, a strategy that has worked well for us in recent years and I believe, differentiates us from most major retailers. We are also confident that our efforts to upgrade our stores and customer service will make the shopping experience an exciting and positive one for our customers this holiday season when their time is so very valuable. 
Second, we feel great about our marketing campaigns, which all speak to who we are as a company. We are utilizing tri-branded campaigns in the U.S. and Canada again this year. Our TV commercials have just launched and will be running every week throughout the holiday season. In addition, we are leveraging components of these campaigns across radio, digital and social media. In Europe, we'll be leveraging our holiday campaign across multiple geographies.
Third, our loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada are an important vehicle for encouraging customers to shop as more frequently and across more of our retail brands.
Next, we believe we continue to get better at transitioning our stores every year and are very focused on our post-holiday plans. Most importantly, we will be offering consumers compelling values on fantastic merchandise. The marketplace is loaded with quality-branded merchandise across all of our geographies. We plan to take advantage of the numerous opportunities and buys throughout December.
In closing, I am very proud of our continued momentum of above-plan results and the sharp execution of our teams across the company. It was great to see another quarter of such strong sales and traffic increases. The entire organization is laser-focused on bringing more shoppers into our stores this holiday season and throughout the year. We have a clear, long-term vision for TJX, and I am convinced that we will continue to drive market share gains and achieve our plans for global growth. I am proud of our ability to simultaneously invest in our growth drivers as well as infrastructure and organization to support our growth while returning cash to shareholders through our substantial share buyback program and dividends.
I want to reiterate that our management team is passionate about achieving and surpassing our goals. We are very well on our way to becoming a $40 billion-plus company.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance. Then we'll open it up for questions."

We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3",677,"Thanks, Ernie.
Now to fiscal '17 guidance, beginning with the fourth quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 versus last year's $0.99 per share. This guidance assumes an expected negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 6% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange. We're modeling fourth quarter consolidated sales of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion. This guidance assumes a 2% negative impact to revenue due to translational FX.
For comp store sales, we're assuming growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. This compares to a strong 6% comp increase for both TJX and Marmaxx in the fourth quarter last year.
Fourth quarter pretax profit margin is planned in the 11.0% to 11.1% range versus 11.9% last year. We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 27.9% to 28.0% versus 28.7% last year. We're expecting SG&A as a percent of sales in the range of 16.8% to 16.9% versus 16.7% last year.
For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.3% and net interest expense of about $10 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 657 million.
Moving on to full year guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '17 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.41. As we noted in our press release today, we are raising our adjusted full year diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect above-plan third quarter results. Excluding the combined impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges, we are now -- expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.48. This would be up 4% to 5% versus $3.33 in fiscal '16. Our plan assumes a negative impact to EPS growth of about 3% due to wage increases and approximately 3% due to foreign currency and transactional foreign exchange.
As a reminder, we expect that wage increases will have a similar negative impact of approximately 3% to fiscal '18 EPS growth.
On a consolidated basis, we're expecting a comp increase of 4% in fiscal '17. For the year, we expect pretax profit margin to be approximately 11.1%. Excluding the negative impact from the third quarter debt extinguishment and pension settlement charges of approximately 20 basis points, we expect adjusted pretax profit margins to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.4% range versus 11.8% last year. We're looking for gross profit margin to be approximately 28.9% versus 28.8% last year.
We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be about 17.4% versus 16.8% last year. For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% and net interest expense of about $44 million. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 664 million.
Now to our full year guidance by division. At Marmaxx, we are now planning comp growth of 4% on sales of $21.1 billion. Additionally, we expect segment profit margin to be about 14%. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming Marmaxx's average ticket to be down versus last year. At HomeGoods, we now expect comps to increase 5% to 6% on sales of $4.4 billion. We now expect segment profit margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.5%. At TJX Canada, we are now planning a comp increase of 8% to 9% on sales of $3.2 billion. We now expect adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be in the range of 13.6% to 13.7%. At TJX International, we're expecting comp growth of about 2% on sales of $4.4 billion and adjustment -- adjusted segment profit margin, excluding foreign currency, to be about 5.8%.
It's important to remember that our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

So as Scott said, we went after the hot-trending categories, but we also affected the ticket by consciously pushing off things like outerwear a little bit later and heavier knits, sweaters that tend to be higher ticket. So hopefully, that makes sense and helps answer that question. I think we'll continue to moderate as best we think. The only unknown is the market is loaded with goods. And that piece that Scott referred to as the second piece could still be applicable as the environment stays rather difficult. We want to continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So tough to say. We still have plenty of open-to-buy as we look out into the spring first quarter, but hopefully, that answers it."

So in terms of the domestic e-com businesses, which are really tjmaxx.com and STP, we have taken a hard look at the cost structures and making sure that we keep our investment at a very appropriate level and in fact, a leveling off level, I guess, would be the best way to describe it. Also, in Europe, similar approach, and we're actually running the ad very efficiently and same idea with the investments. We're looking hard and fast.

And I was just in Europe last week, coincidentally, and we spent quite a bit of time talking strategically about where we're going with e-com as well as looking at the metrics and what it's doing for the total in terms of traffic, et cetera. And it would actually move the comp in Europe but not a full point, but a little bit, just under that actually."

Just curious, your margins there used to be 7%, 8%. I think you had somewhat more aspirational goals than that. So just curious, what kind of comp do you need in Europe to get the margins closer to high single digit? When does Trade Secret become more neutral to the earnings? And then the second question, hypothetically, at a 15% tax rate, you guys would be throwing off an additional $1 billion of free cash next year. So curious, I know you have a mix of international as well as domestic taxes. But is there really a thought internally that this is what could play out next year? And would you use that additional $1 billion for share repurchase versus dividends? Any thoughts along those lines would be helpful."

And then it would only comment, obviously, if it's relevant to our business. So just too early at this point to speculate. And in terms of Europe, I'll just start off for a second, and Ernie -- the big -- some of the biggest impact has been FX over the -- in the last -- certainly, the last couple -- this year as it has been with Canada. We've had opening up the new businesses -- not new businesses, new countries in the last year or 2. We've also been ramping up the number of stores, so with the 50-plus stores we've opened up, both this year and almost at that level last year, new stores, since it takes several years to get maturity, put a bit of an impact on earnings, that in combination with the systems and the infrastructure needed to support that stores has certainly put it down. So it's really less about the comp, the same level of comp when you hit that 3-plus range in all of our divisions and that all things being equal, is usually the breakpoint. But with wage systems and opening up a number of stores in new countries, put a bit of a pressure. The only other thing before Ernie talks about Trade Secret and Europe in general is as we move to the fourth quarter, we purchased Trade Secret at the end of October a year ago, so in terms of the deleverage, we would expect that to moderate and not be a meaningful impact as we enter actually the quarter that we're currently in the fourth."

So Brian, in terms of Europe, it's good timing for your question. I was there all last week, coincidentally.

So Brian, in terms of Europe, it's good timing for your question. I was there all last week, coincidentally. And we went -- did a lot of floor walks with the merchants as well as our field store personnel, and we are well-poised for the fourth quarter. I have to tell you that I am extremely bullish on what I saw over there last week for where we are heading into mid-November in terms of a mix in the stores and how we're presenting and how we're staffed for servicing the customer. So feeling very good about that. The other thing to keep in mind there, and this, I think, starts to answer your question, at least in terms of, yes, comp would help. Why do I think the comp will get better is they are positioned well, but the sales that we have, the flat quarter, we were dealing with unseasonably warm weather there. And you look at the environment as it is, and we are clearly gaining market share. If you look at some of the results that come out, we don't like to give specifics on that, but you can see that we are making very major inroads, not dissimilar than we are here. It's just all of the numbers are lower there. There are bigger decreases. Some store closings were just announced from a couple of the retailers over there, which you can figure out who they were. And so we're very bullish on our market share gain there. Yes, the FX has really put a bit of a damper on the margin rate. Scott and I are often talking about how that has to come back to us at one point. And the medium and short-term here, though I'm looking for us to continue to gain more customers and that team over there -- I wish sometimes you could see the team over there. They are extremely diligent at staying execution-oriented when times get tough. So one of the things I give them credit for, I think you noticed the profit over there was slightly above our segment profit plan. And that was due to how diligently they control their liquidity and manage expenses on a quarter when the sales were only flat. So I give that team a lot of credit for staying liquid, watching expenses and getting poised for plenty of availability of which you can imagine they have enormous availability over there for the fourth quarter. So again, feeling very good about them."

So what that has allowed our merchants to do is continue to buy later into the season with more knowledge and take advantage of more inventory closeout lists that sometimes show up at a time when before it would have become a packaway. And now it can become an in-season sales driver. That is great for the vendor because they don't have to deal with us on a packaway. And also at the same time, it's great for our customers, more importantly, because they get to see these fresh goods hitting in just before Christmas or just before Thanksgiving that are very fresh and were just recently in other stores.

Division in Canada that travels to Europe and internationally as well as satellite buying offices. We have buyers in Europe and a satellite office that represents HomeGoods and Marmaxx. We have a Californian buying office. They travel to other countries. Our buying offices do a lot more exploratory trips. All the different buying officers will try to go into new places where we think there are new categories of goods that would be exciting. Examples are like leather goods out of Italy, right? So -- or something that is out of Africa that would be great in the home deck area. Those are the types of things you're talking about that would hit Marmaxx that are more global-type buys. This clearly, if you look, we even had like outdoor-type items that are bought for HomeGoods that are bought certainly, obviously internationally purchased by our buyer. So we've added to -- I think, I talked about the buying staff has doubled over the last 10 years. And part of that buying structure is buying global merchandise, scoring from other areas. So that has been a huge, huge, huge advantage. That's why we have 1,000 buyers now. And when you see that -- I think, I mentioned that we have 1,800 vendors, and that has grown up a significant amount in really just the last 5 years. A lot of those vendors are international vendors, and are giving us that different flavor. So it's a great question because what we get out of it, we think, is a differentiating piece in our mix that other retailers really can't show. And it's because, as I said in my script, that's where I think we're a sourcing machine and really, we just have a very talented buying team that gets a lot of ground covered in a lot of parts of the world.

But since that, we're feeling much better about the day-in, day-out traffic in purchasing. We still are not, all in all, happy with that IT -- with the website business. It's a little early to tell. So we have really gone after the store initiative, which I think we've talked about. We want -- we've got plenty of room now to find out about the web business because of this value pricing. We've done some reorg with merchants that are now in place, and we are feeling really good about going forward there.

We put in some new merchants there to help with the website business, and the store end of the STP business we've actually been very happy with. That one's been a longer-term success rate for us. It's just early, and it's really early in the whole curve of building that business. So we're going to have some sites that at the year-end call we'll talk in more depth. We won't go into that today. We'll talk about at the year-end call some of the stores that we're going to open there, and we'll give more color, I think, on the total business at that point in time.
So I believe that is the end of our call. Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you at our year-end earnings call in February. Thank you, everybody."
